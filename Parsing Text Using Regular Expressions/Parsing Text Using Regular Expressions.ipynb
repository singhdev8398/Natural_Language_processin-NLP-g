The morning was so damp and misty that\\r\\nit was only with great difficulty that the day succeeded in breaking;\\r\\nand it was impossible to distinguish anything more than a few yards\\r\\naway from the carriage windows.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the passengers by this particular train were returning from\\r\\nabroad; but the third-class carriages were the best filled, chiefly\\r\\nwith insignificant persons of various occupations and degrees, picked\\r\\nup at the different stations nearer town. All of them seemed weary, and\\r\\nmost of them had sleepy eyes and a shivering expression, while their\\r\\ncomplexions generally appeared to have taken on the colour of the fog\\r\\noutside.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen day dawned, two passengers in one of the third-class carriages\\r\\nfound themselves opposite each other. Both were young fellows, both\\r\\nwere rather poorly dressed, both had remarkable faces, and both were\\r\\nevidently anxious to start a conversation. If they had but known why,\\r\\nat this particular moment, they were both remarkable persons, they\\r\\nwould undoubtedly have wondered at the strange chance which had set\\r\\nthem down opposite to one another in a third-class carriage of the\\r\\nWarsaw Railway Company.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of them was a young fellow of about twenty-seven, not tall, with\\r\\nblack curling hair, and small, grey, fiery eyes. His nose was broad and\\r\\nflat, and he had high cheek bones; his thin lips were constantly\\r\\ncompressed into an impudent, ironicalâ\\x80\\x94it might almost be called a\\r\\nmaliciousâ\\x80\\x94smile; but his forehead was high and well formed, and atoned\\r\\nfor a good deal of the ugliness of the lower part of his face. A\\r\\nspecial feature of this physiognomy was its death-like pallor, which\\r\\ngave to the whole man an indescribably emaciated appearance in spite of\\r\\nhis hard look, and at the same time a sort of passionate and suffering\\r\\nexpression which did not harmonize with his impudent, sarcastic smile\\r\\nand keen, self-satisfied bearing. He wore a large furâ\\x80\\x94or rather\\r\\nastrachanâ\\x80\\x94overcoat, which had kept him warm all night, while his\\r\\nneighbour had been obliged to bear the full severity of a Russian\\r\\nNovember night entirely unprepared. His wide sleeveless mantle with a\\r\\nlarge cape to itâ\\x80\\x94the sort of cloak one sees upon travellers during the\\r\\nwinter months in Switzerland or North Italyâ\\x80\\x94was by no means adapted to\\r\\nthe long cold journey through Russia, from Eydkuhnen to St. Petersburg.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wearer of this cloak was a young fellow, also of about twenty-six\\r\\nor twenty-seven years of age, slightly above the middle height, very\\r\\nfair, with a thin, pointed and very light coloured beard; his eyes were\\r\\nlarge and blue, and had an intent look about them, yet that heavy\\r\\nexpression which some people affirm to be a peculiarity as well as\\r\\nevidence, of an epileptic subject. His face was decidedly a pleasant\\r\\none for all that; refined, but quite colourless, except for the\\r\\ncircumstance that at this moment it was blue with cold. He held a\\r\\nbundle made up of an old faded silk handkerchief that apparently\\r\\ncontained all his travelling wardrobe, and wore thick shoes and\\r\\ngaiters, his whole appearance being very un-Russian.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis black-haired neighbour inspected these peculiarities, having\\r\\nnothing better to do, and at length remarked, with that rude enjoyment\\r\\nof the discomforts of others which the common classes so often show:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCold?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery,â\\x80\\x9d said his neighbour, readily, â\\x80\\x9cand this is a thaw, too. Fancy if\\r\\nit had been a hard frost! I never thought it would be so cold in the\\r\\nold country. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve grown quite out of the way of it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat, been abroad, I suppose?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, straight from Switzerland.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWheugh! my goodness!â\\x80\\x9d The black-haired young fellow whistled, and then\\r\\nlaughed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conversation proceeded. The readiness of the fair-haired young man\\r\\nin the cloak to answer all his opposite neighbourâ\\x80\\x99s questions was\\r\\nsurprising. He seemed to have no suspicion of any impertinence or\\r\\ninappropriateness in the fact of such questions being put to him.\\r\\nReplying to them, he made known to the inquirer that he certainly had\\r\\nbeen long absent from Russia, more than four years; that he had been\\r\\nsent abroad for his health; that he had suffered from some strange\\r\\nnervous maladyâ\\x80\\x94a kind of epilepsy, with convulsive spasms. His\\r\\ninterlocutor burst out laughing several times at his answers; and more\\r\\nthan ever, when to the question, â\\x80\\x9cwhether he had been cured?â\\x80\\x9d the\\r\\npatient replied:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, they did not cure me.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHey! thatâ\\x80\\x99s it! You stumped up your money for nothing, and we believe\\r\\nin those fellows, here!â\\x80\\x9d remarked the black-haired individual,\\r\\nsarcastically.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGospel truth, sir, Gospel truth!â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed another passenger, a\\r\\nshabbily dressed man of about forty, who looked like a clerk, and\\r\\npossessed a red nose and a very blotchy face. â\\x80\\x9cGospel truth! All they\\r\\ndo is to get hold of our good Russian money free, gratis, and for\\r\\nnothing.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, but youâ\\x80\\x99re quite wrong in my particular instance,â\\x80\\x9d said the Swiss\\r\\npatient, quietly. â\\x80\\x9cOf course I canâ\\x80\\x99t argue the matter, because I know\\r\\nonly my own case; but my doctor gave me moneyâ\\x80\\x94and he had very littleâ\\x80\\x94to\\r\\npay my journey back, besides having kept me at his own expense, while\\r\\nthere, for nearly two years.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy? Was there no one else to pay for you?â\\x80\\x9d asked the black-haired\\r\\none.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNoâ\\x80\\x94Mr. Pavlicheff, who had been supporting me there, died a couple of\\r\\nyears ago. I wrote to Mrs. General Epanchin at the time (she is a\\r\\ndistant relative of mine), but she did not answer my letter. And so\\r\\neventually I came back.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd where have you come to?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat isâ\\x80\\x94where am I going to stay? Iâ\\x80\\x94I really donâ\\x80\\x99t quite know yet, Iâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth the listeners laughed again.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI suppose your whole set-up is in that bundle, then?â\\x80\\x9d asked the first.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI bet anything it is!â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed the red-nosed passenger, with extreme\\r\\nsatisfaction, â\\x80\\x9cand that he has precious little in the luggage\\r\\nvan!â\\x80\\x94though of course poverty is no crimeâ\\x80\\x94we must remember that!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt appeared that it was indeed as they had surmised. The young fellow\\r\\nhastened to admit the fact with wonderful readiness.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYour bundle has some importance, however,â\\x80\\x9d continued the clerk, when\\r\\nthey had laughed their fill (it was observable that the subject of\\r\\ntheir mirth joined in the laughter when he saw them laughing); â\\x80\\x9cfor\\r\\nthough I dare say it is not stuffed full of friedrichs dâ\\x80\\x99or and louis\\r\\ndâ\\x80\\x99orâ\\x80\\x94judge from your costume and gaitersâ\\x80\\x94stillâ\\x80\\x94if you can add to your\\r\\npossessions such a valuable property as a relation like Mrs. General\\r\\nEpanchin, then your bundle becomes a significant object at once. That\\r\\nis, of course, if you really are a relative of Mrs. Epanchinâ\\x80\\x99s, and\\r\\nhave not made a little error throughâ\\x80\\x94well, absence of mind, which is\\r\\nvery common to human beings; or, sayâ\\x80\\x94through a too luxuriant fancy?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, you are right again,â\\x80\\x9d said the fair-haired traveller, â\\x80\\x9cfor I\\r\\nreally am _almost_ wrong when I say she and I are related. She is\\r\\nhardly a relation at all; so little, in fact, that I was not in the\\r\\nleast surprised to have no answer to my letter. I expected as much.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHâ\\x80\\x99m! you spent your postage for nothing, then. Hâ\\x80\\x99m! you are candid,\\r\\nhoweverâ\\x80\\x94and that is commendable. Hâ\\x80\\x99m! Mrs. Epanchinâ\\x80\\x94oh yes! a most\\r\\neminent person. I know her. As for Mr. Pavlicheff, who supported you in\\r\\nSwitzerland, I know him tooâ\\x80\\x94at least, if it was Nicolai Andreevitch of\\r\\nthat name? A fine fellow he wasâ\\x80\\x94and had a property of four thousand\\r\\nsouls in his day.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, Nicolai Andreevitchâ\\x80\\x94that was his name,â\\x80\\x9d and the young fellow\\r\\nlooked earnestly and with curiosity at the all-knowing gentleman with\\r\\nthe red nose.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis sort of character is met with pretty frequently in a certain\\r\\nclass. They are people who know everyoneâ\\x80\\x94that is, they know where a man\\r\\nis employed, what his salary is, whom he knows, whom he married, what\\r\\nmoney his wife had, who are his cousins, and second cousins, etc., etc.\\r\\nThese men generally have about a hundred pounds a year to live on, and\\r\\nthey spend their whole time and talents in the amassing of this style\\r\\nof knowledge, which they reduceâ\\x80\\x94or raiseâ\\x80\\x94to the standard of a science.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the latter part of the conversation the black-haired young man\\r\\nhad become very impatient. He stared out of the window, and fidgeted,\\r\\nand evidently longed for the end of the journey. He was very absent; he\\r\\nwould appear to listenâ\\x80\\x94and heard nothing; and he would laugh of a\\r\\nsudden, evidently with no idea of what he was laughing about.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExcuse me,â\\x80\\x9d said the red-nosed man to the young fellow with the\\r\\nbundle, rather suddenly; â\\x80\\x9cwhom have I the honour to be talking to?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPrince Lef Nicolaievitch Muishkin,â\\x80\\x9d replied the latter, with perfect\\r\\nreadiness.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPrince Muishkin? Lef Nicolaievitch? Hâ\\x80\\x99m! I donâ\\x80\\x99t know, Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure! I may\\r\\nsay I have never heard of such a person,â\\x80\\x9d said the clerk, thoughtfully.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAt least, the name, I admit, is historical. Karamsin must mention the\\r\\nfamily name, of course, in his historyâ\\x80\\x94but as an individualâ\\x80\\x94one never\\r\\nhears of any Prince Muishkin nowadays.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course not,â\\x80\\x9d replied the prince; â\\x80\\x9cthere are none, except myself. I\\r\\nbelieve I am the last and only one. As to my forefathers, they have\\r\\nalways been a poor lot; my own father was a sublieutenant in the army.\\r\\nI donâ\\x80\\x99t know how Mrs. Epanchin comes into the Muishkin family, but she\\r\\nis descended from the Princess Muishkin, and she, too, is the last of\\r\\nher line.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd did you learn science and all that, with your professor over\\r\\nthere?â\\x80\\x9d asked the black-haired passenger.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh yesâ\\x80\\x94I did learn a little, butâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve never learned anything whatever,â\\x80\\x9d said the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, but I learned very little, you know!â\\x80\\x9d added the prince, as though\\r\\nexcusing himself. â\\x80\\x9cThey could not teach me very much on account of my\\r\\nillness.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you know the Rogojins?â\\x80\\x9d asked his questioner, abruptly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I donâ\\x80\\x99tâ\\x80\\x94not at all! I hardly know anyone in Russia. Why, is that\\r\\nyour name?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I am Rogojin, Parfen Rogojin.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cParfen Rogojin? dear meâ\\x80\\x94then donâ\\x80\\x99t you belong to those very Rogojins,\\r\\nperhapsâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d began the clerk, with a very perceptible increase of civility\\r\\nin his tone.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYesâ\\x80\\x94those very ones,â\\x80\\x9d interrupted Rogojin, impatiently, and with scant\\r\\ncourtesy. I may remark that he had not once taken any notice of the\\r\\nblotchy-faced passenger, and had hitherto addressed all his remarks\\r\\ndirect to the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDear meâ\\x80\\x94is it possible?â\\x80\\x9d observed the clerk, while his face assumed an\\r\\nexpression of great deference and servilityâ\\x80\\x94if not of absolute alarm:\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat, a son of that very Semen Rogojinâ\\x80\\x94hereditary honourable\\r\\ncitizenâ\\x80\\x94who died a month or so ago and left two million and a half of\\r\\nroubles?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd how do _you_ know that he left two million and a half of roubles?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nasked Rogojin, disdainfully, and not deigning so much as to look at the\\r\\nother. â\\x80\\x9cHowever, itâ\\x80\\x99s true enough that my father died a month ago, and\\r\\nthat here am I returning from Pskoff, a month after, with hardly a boot\\r\\nto my foot. Theyâ\\x80\\x99ve treated me like a dog! Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been ill of fever at\\r\\nPskoff the whole time, and not a line, nor farthing of money, have I\\r\\nreceived from my mother or my confounded brother!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd now youâ\\x80\\x99ll have a million roubles, at leastâ\\x80\\x94goodness gracious me!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nexclaimed the clerk, rubbing his hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFive weeks since, I was just like yourself,â\\x80\\x9d continued Rogojin,\\r\\naddressing the prince, â\\x80\\x9cwith nothing but a bundle and the clothes I\\r\\nwore. I ran away from my father and came to Pskoff to my auntâ\\x80\\x99s house,\\r\\nwhere I caved in at once with fever, and he went and died while I was\\r\\naway. All honour to my respected fatherâ\\x80\\x99s memoryâ\\x80\\x94but he uncommonly\\r\\nnearly killed me, all the same. Give you my word, prince, if I hadnâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\ncut and run then, when I did, heâ\\x80\\x99d have murdered me like a dog.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI suppose you angered him somehow?â\\x80\\x9d asked the prince, looking at the\\r\\nmillionaire with considerable curiosity. But though there may have been\\r\\nsomething remarkable in the fact that this man was heir to millions of\\r\\nroubles there was something about him which surprised and interested\\r\\nthe prince more than that. Rogojin, too, seemed to have taken up the\\r\\nconversation with unusual alacrity it appeared that he was still in a\\r\\nconsiderable state of excitement, if not absolutely feverish, and was\\r\\nin real need of someone to talk to for the mere sake of talking, as\\r\\nsafety-valve to his agitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for his red-nosed neighbour, the latterâ\\x80\\x94since the information as to\\r\\nthe identity of Rogojinâ\\x80\\x94hung over him, seemed to be living on the honey\\r\\nof his words and in the breath of his nostrils, catching at every\\r\\nsyllable as though it were a pearl of great price.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, yes; I angered himâ\\x80\\x94I certainly did anger him,â\\x80\\x9d replied Rogojin.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut what puts me out so is my brother. Of course my mother couldnâ\\x80\\x99t do\\r\\nanythingâ\\x80\\x94sheâ\\x80\\x99s too oldâ\\x80\\x94and whatever brother Senka says is law for her!\\r\\nBut why couldnâ\\x80\\x99t he let me know? He sent a telegram, they say. Whatâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nthe good of a telegram? It frightened my aunt so that she sent it back\\r\\nto the office unopened, and there itâ\\x80\\x99s been ever since! Itâ\\x80\\x99s only\\r\\nthanks to Konief that I heard at all; he wrote me all about it. He says\\r\\nmy brother cut off the gold tassels from my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s coffin, at night\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98because theyâ\\x80\\x99re worth a lot of money!â\\x80\\x99 says he. Why, I can get him\\r\\nsent off to Siberia for that alone, if I like; itâ\\x80\\x99s sacrilege. Here,\\r\\nyouâ\\x80\\x94scarecrow!â\\x80\\x9d he added, addressing the clerk at his side, â\\x80\\x9cis it\\r\\nsacrilege or not, by law?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSacrilege, certainlyâ\\x80\\x94certainly sacrilege,â\\x80\\x9d said the latter.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd itâ\\x80\\x99s Siberia for sacrilege, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cUndoubtedly so; Siberia, of course!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey will think that Iâ\\x80\\x99m still ill,â\\x80\\x9d continued Rogojin to the prince,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbut I sloped off quietly, seedy as I was, took the train and came\\r\\naway. Aha, brother Senka, youâ\\x80\\x99ll have to open your gates and let me in,\\r\\nmy boy! I know he told tales about me to my fatherâ\\x80\\x94I know that well\\r\\nenough but I certainly did rile my father about Nastasia Philipovna\\r\\nthatâ\\x80\\x99s very sure, and that was my own doing.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNastasia Philipovna?â\\x80\\x9d said the clerk, as though trying to think out\\r\\nsomething.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome, you know nothing about _her_,â\\x80\\x9d said Rogojin, impatiently.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd supposing I do know something?â\\x80\\x9d observed the other, triumphantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBosh! there are plenty of Nastasia Philipovnas. And what an\\r\\nimpertinent beast you are!â\\x80\\x9d he added angrily. â\\x80\\x9cI thought some creature\\r\\nlike you would hang on to me as soon as I got hold of my money.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, but I do know, as it happens,â\\x80\\x9d said the clerk in an aggravating\\r\\nmanner. â\\x80\\x9cLebedeff knows all about her. You are pleased to reproach me,\\r\\nyour excellency, but what if I prove that I am right after all?\\r\\nNastasia Philipovnaâ\\x80\\x99s family name is Barashkoffâ\\x80\\x94I know, you seeâ\\x80\\x94and she\\r\\nis a very well known lady, indeed, and comes of a good family, too. She\\r\\nis connected with one Totski, Afanasy Ivanovitch, a man of considerable\\r\\nproperty, a director of companies, and so on, and a great friend of\\r\\nGeneral Epanchin, who is interested in the same matters as he is.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy eyes!â\\x80\\x9d said Rogojin, really surprised at last. â\\x80\\x9cThe devil take the\\r\\nfellow, how does he know that?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, he knows everythingâ\\x80\\x94Lebedeff knows everything! I was a month or\\r\\ntwo with Lihachof after his father died, your excellency, and while he\\r\\nwas knocking aboutâ\\x80\\x94heâ\\x80\\x99s in the debtorâ\\x80\\x99s prison nowâ\\x80\\x94I was with him, and\\r\\nhe couldnâ\\x80\\x99t do a thing without Lebedeff; and I got to know Nastasia\\r\\nPhilipovna and several people at that time.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNastasia Philipovna? Why, you donâ\\x80\\x99t mean to say that she and\\r\\nLihachofâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d cried Rogojin, turning quite pale.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, no, no, no, no! Nothing of the sort, I assure you!â\\x80\\x9d said Lebedeff,\\r\\nhastily. â\\x80\\x9cOh dear no, not for the world! Totskiâ\\x80\\x99s the only man with any\\r\\nchance there. Oh, no! He takes her to his box at the opera at the\\r\\nFrench theatre of an evening, and the officers and people all look at\\r\\nher and say, â\\x80\\x98By Jove, thereâ\\x80\\x99s the famous Nastasia Philipovna!â\\x80\\x99 but no\\r\\none ever gets any further than that, for there is nothing more to say.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, itâ\\x80\\x99s quite true,â\\x80\\x9d said Rogojin, frowning gloomily; â\\x80\\x9cso Zaleshoff\\r\\ntold me. I was walking about the Nefsky one fine day, prince, in my\\r\\nfatherâ\\x80\\x99s old coat, when she suddenly came out of a shop and stepped\\r\\ninto her carriage. I swear I was all of a blaze at once. Then I met\\r\\nZaleshoffâ\\x80\\x94looking like a hair-dresserâ\\x80\\x99s assistant, got up as fine as I\\r\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t know who, while I looked like a tinker. â\\x80\\x98Donâ\\x80\\x99t flatter yourself,\\r\\nmy boy,â\\x80\\x99 said he; â\\x80\\x98sheâ\\x80\\x99s not for such as you; sheâ\\x80\\x99s a princess, she is,\\r\\nand her name is Nastasia Philipovna Barashkoff, and she lives with\\r\\nTotski, who wishes to get rid of her because heâ\\x80\\x99s growing rather\\r\\noldâ\\x80\\x94fifty-five or soâ\\x80\\x94and wants to marry a certain beauty, the loveliest\\r\\nwoman in all Petersburg.â\\x80\\x99 And then he told me that I could see Nastasia\\r\\nPhilipovna at the opera-house that evening, if I liked, and described\\r\\nwhich was her box. Well, Iâ\\x80\\x99d like to see my father allowing any of us\\r\\nto go to the theatre; heâ\\x80\\x99d sooner have killed us, any day. However, I\\r\\nwent for an hour or so and saw Nastasia Philipovna, and I never slept a\\r\\nwink all night after. Next morning my father happened to give me two\\r\\ngovernment loan bonds to sell, worth nearly five thousand roubles each.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Sell them,â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98and then take seven thousand five hundred\\r\\nroubles to the office, give them to the cashier, and bring me back the\\r\\nrest of the ten thousand, without looking in anywhere on the way; look\\r\\nsharp, I shall be waiting for you.â\\x80\\x99 Well, I sold the bonds, but I\\r\\ndidnâ\\x80\\x99t take the seven thousand roubles to the office; I went straight\\r\\nto the English shop and chose a pair of earrings, with a diamond the\\r\\nsize of a nut in each. They cost four hundred roubles more than I had,\\r\\nso I gave my name, and they trusted me. With the earrings I went at\\r\\nonce to Zaleshoffâ\\x80\\x99s. â\\x80\\x98Come on!â\\x80\\x99 I said, â\\x80\\x98come on to Nastasia\\r\\nPhilipovnaâ\\x80\\x99s,â\\x80\\x99 and off we went without more ado. I tell you I hadnâ\\x80\\x99t a\\r\\nnotion of what was about me or before me or below my feet all the way;\\r\\nI saw nothing whatever. We went straight into her drawing-room, and\\r\\nthen she came out to us.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI didnâ\\x80\\x99t say right out who I was, but Zaleshoff said: â\\x80\\x98From Parfen\\r\\nRogojin, in memory of his first meeting with you yesterday; be so kind\\r\\nas to accept these!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe opened the parcel, looked at the earrings, and laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Thank your friend Mr. Rogojin for his kind attention,â\\x80\\x99 says she, and\\r\\nbowed and went off. Why didnâ\\x80\\x99t I die there on the spot? The worst of it\\r\\nall was, though, that the beast Zaleshoff got all the credit of it! I\\r\\nwas short and abominably dressed, and stood and stared in her face and\\r\\nnever said a word, because I was shy, like an ass! And there was he all\\r\\nin the fashion, pomaded and dressed out, with a smart tie on, bowing\\r\\nand scraping; and I bet anything she took him for me all the while!\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Look here now,â\\x80\\x99 I said, when we came out, â\\x80\\x98none of your interference\\r\\nhere after thisâ\\x80\\x94do you understand?â\\x80\\x99 He laughed: â\\x80\\x98And how are you going\\r\\nto settle up with your father?â\\x80\\x99 says he. I thought I might as well jump\\r\\ninto the Neva at once without going home first; but it struck me that I\\r\\nwouldnâ\\x80\\x99t, after all, and I went home feeling like one of the damned.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy goodness!â\\x80\\x9d shivered the clerk. â\\x80\\x9cAnd his father,â\\x80\\x9d he added, for the\\r\\nprinceâ\\x80\\x99s instruction, â\\x80\\x9cand his father would have given a man a ticket\\r\\nto the other world for ten roubles any dayâ\\x80\\x94not to speak of ten\\r\\nthousand!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince observed Rogojin with great curiosity; he seemed paler than\\r\\never at this moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat do you know about it?â\\x80\\x9d cried the latter. â\\x80\\x9cWell, my father learned\\r\\nthe whole story at once, and Zaleshoff blabbed it all over the town\\r\\nbesides. So he took me upstairs and locked me up, and swore at me for\\r\\nan hour. â\\x80\\x98This is only a foretaste,â\\x80\\x99 says he; â\\x80\\x98wait a bit till night\\r\\ncomes, and Iâ\\x80\\x99ll come back and talk to you again.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, what do you think? The old fellow went straight off to Nastasia\\r\\nPhilipovna, touched the floor with his forehead, and began blubbering\\r\\nand beseeching her on his knees to give him back the diamonds. So after\\r\\nawhile she brought the box and flew out at him. â\\x80\\x98There,â\\x80\\x99 she says,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98take your earrings, you wretched old miser; although they are ten\\r\\ntimes dearer than their value to me now that I know what it must have\\r\\ncost Parfen to get them! Give Parfen my compliments,â\\x80\\x99 she says, â\\x80\\x98and\\r\\nthank him very much!â\\x80\\x99 Well, I meanwhile had borrowed twenty-five\\r\\nroubles from a friend, and off I went to Pskoff to my auntâ\\x80\\x99s. The old\\r\\nwoman there lectured me so that I left the house and went on a drinking\\r\\ntour round the public-houses of the place. I was in a high fever when I\\r\\ngot to Pskoff, and by nightfall I was lying delirious in the streets\\r\\nsomewhere or other!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOho! weâ\\x80\\x99ll make Nastasia Philipovna sing another song now!â\\x80\\x9d giggled\\r\\nLebedeff, rubbing his hands with glee. â\\x80\\x9cHey, my boy, weâ\\x80\\x99ll get her some\\r\\nproper earrings now! Weâ\\x80\\x99ll get her such earrings thatâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLook here,â\\x80\\x9d cried Rogojin, seizing him fiercely by the arm, â\\x80\\x9clook\\r\\nhere, if you so much as name Nastasia Philipovna again, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll tan your\\r\\nhide as sure as you sit there!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAha! doâ\\x80\\x94by all means! if you tan my hide you wonâ\\x80\\x99t turn me away from\\r\\nyour society. Youâ\\x80\\x99ll bind me to you, with your lash, for ever. Ha, ha!\\r\\nhere we are at the station, though.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSure enough, the train was just steaming in as he spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough Rogojin had declared that he left Pskoff secretly, a large\\r\\ncollection of friends had assembled to greet him, and did so with\\r\\nprofuse waving of hats and shouting.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, thereâ\\x80\\x99s Zaleshoff here, too!â\\x80\\x9d he muttered, gazing at the scene\\r\\nwith a sort of triumphant but unpleasant smile. Then he suddenly turned\\r\\nto the prince: â\\x80\\x9cPrince, I donâ\\x80\\x99t know why I have taken a fancy to you;\\r\\nperhaps because I met you just when I did. But no, it canâ\\x80\\x99t be that,\\r\\nfor I met this fellowâ\\x80\\x9d (nodding at Lebedeff) â\\x80\\x9ctoo, and I have not taken\\r\\na fancy to him by any means. Come to see me, prince; weâ\\x80\\x99ll take off\\r\\nthose gaiters of yours and dress you up in a smart fur coat, the best\\r\\nwe can buy. You shall have a dress coat, best quality, white waistcoat,\\r\\nanything you like, and your pocket shall be full of money. Come, and\\r\\nyou shall go with me to Nastasia Philipovnaâ\\x80\\x99s. Now then will you come\\r\\nor no?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAccept, accept, Prince Lef Nicolaievitchâ\\x80\\x9d said Lebedef solemnly;\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t let it slip! Accept, quick!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPrince Muishkin rose and stretched out his hand courteously, while he\\r\\nreplied with some cordiality:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI will come with the greatest pleasure, and thank you very much for\\r\\ntaking a fancy to me. I dare say I may even come today if I have time,\\r\\nfor I tell you frankly that I like you very much too. I liked you\\r\\nespecially when you told us about the diamond earrings; but I liked you\\r\\nbefore that as well, though you have such a dark-clouded sort of face.\\r\\nThanks very much for the offer of clothes and a fur coat; I certainly\\r\\nshall require both clothes and coat very soon. As for money, I have\\r\\nhardly a copeck about me at this moment.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou shall have lots of money; by the evening I shall have plenty; so\\r\\ncome along!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s true enough, heâ\\x80\\x99ll have lots before evening!â\\x80\\x9d put in Lebedeff.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut, look here, are you a great hand with the ladies? Letâ\\x80\\x99s know that\\r\\nfirst?â\\x80\\x9d asked Rogojin.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh no, oh no!â\\x80\\x9d said the prince; â\\x80\\x9cI couldnâ\\x80\\x99t, you knowâ\\x80\\x94my illnessâ\\x80\\x94I\\r\\nhardly ever saw a soul.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHâ\\x80\\x99m! wellâ\\x80\\x94here, you fellowâ\\x80\\x94you can come along with me now if you\\r\\nlike!â\\x80\\x9d cried Rogojin to Lebedeff, and so they all left the carriage.\\r\\n\\r\\nLebedeff had his desire. He went off with the noisy group of Rogojinâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nfriends towards the Voznesensky, while the princeâ\\x80\\x99s route lay towards\\r\\nthe Litaynaya. It was damp and wet. The prince asked his way of\\r\\npassers-by, and finding that he was a couple of miles or so from his\\r\\ndestination, he determined to take a droshky.\\r\\n\\r\\nII.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Epanchin lived in his own house near the Litaynaya. Besides\\r\\nthis large residenceâ\\x80\\x94five-sixths of which was let in flats and\\r\\nlodgingsâ\\x80\\x94the general was owner of another enormous house in the\\r\\nSadovaya bringing in even more rent than the first. Besides these\\r\\nhouses he had a delightful little estate just out of town, and some\\r\\nsort of factory in another part of the city. General Epanchin, as\\r\\neveryone knew, had a good deal to do with certain government\\r\\nmonopolies; he was also a voice, and an important one, in many rich\\r\\npublic companies of various descriptions; in fact, he enjoyed the\\r\\nreputation of being a well-to-do man of busy habits, many ties, and\\r\\naffluent means. He had made himself indispensable in several quarters,\\r\\namongst others in his department of the government; and yet it was a\\r\\nknown fact that Fedor Ivanovitch Epanchin was a man of no education\\r\\nwhatever, and had absolutely risen from the ranks.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis last fact could, of course, reflect nothing but credit upon the\\r\\ngeneral; and yet, though unquestionably a sagacious man, he had his own\\r\\nlittle weaknessesâ\\x80\\x94very excusable ones,â\\x80\\x94one of which was a dislike to\\r\\nany allusion to the above circumstance. He was undoubtedly clever. For\\r\\ninstance, he made a point of never asserting himself when he would gain\\r\\nmore by keeping in the background; and in consequence many exalted\\r\\npersonages valued him principally for his humility and simplicity, and\\r\\nbecause â\\x80\\x9che knew his place.â\\x80\\x9d And yet if these good people could only\\r\\nhave had a peep into the mind of this excellent fellow who â\\x80\\x9cknew his\\r\\nplaceâ\\x80\\x9d so well! The fact is that, in spite of his knowledge of the\\r\\nworld and his really remarkable abilities, he always liked to appear to\\r\\nbe carrying out other peopleâ\\x80\\x99s ideas rather than his own. And also, his\\r\\nluck seldom failed him, even at cards, for which he had a passion that\\r\\nhe did not attempt to conceal. He played for high stakes, and moved,\\r\\naltogether, in very varied society.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to age, General Epanchin was in the very prime of life; that is,\\r\\nabout fifty-five years of age,â\\x80\\x94the flowering time of existence, when\\r\\nreal enjoyment of life begins. His healthy appearance, good colour,\\r\\nsound, though discoloured teeth, sturdy figure, preoccupied air during\\r\\nbusiness hours, and jolly good humour during his game at cards in the\\r\\nevening, all bore witness to his success in life, and combined to make\\r\\nexistence a bed of roses to his excellency. The general was lord of a\\r\\nflourishing family, consisting of his wife and three grown-up\\r\\ndaughters. He had married young, while still a lieutenant, his wife\\r\\nbeing a girl of about his own age, who possessed neither beauty nor\\r\\neducation, and who brought him no more than fifty souls of landed\\r\\nproperty, which little estate served, however, as a nest-egg for far\\r\\nmore important accumulations. The general never regretted his early\\r\\nmarriage, or regarded it as a foolish youthful escapade; and he so\\r\\nrespected and feared his wife that he was very near loving her. Mrs.\\r\\nEpanchin came of the princely stock of Muishkin, which if not a\\r\\nbrilliant, was, at all events, a decidedly ancient family; and she was\\r\\nextremely proud of her descent.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a few exceptions, the worthy couple had lived through their long\\r\\nunion very happily. While still young the wife had been able to make\\r\\nimportant friends among the aristocracy, partly by virtue of her family\\r\\ndescent, and partly by her own exertions; while, in after life, thanks\\r\\nto their wealth and to the position of her husband in the service, she\\r\\ntook her place among the higher circles as by right.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring these last few years all three of the generalâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ndaughtersâ\\x80\\x94Alexandra, Adelaida, and Aglayaâ\\x80\\x94had grown up and matured. Of\\r\\ncourse they were only Epanchins, but their motherâ\\x80\\x99s family was noble;\\r\\nthey might expect considerable fortunes; their father had hopes of\\r\\nattaining to very high rank indeed in his countryâ\\x80\\x99s serviceâ\\x80\\x94all of\\r\\nwhich was satisfactory. All three of the girls were decidedly pretty,\\r\\neven the eldest, Alexandra, who was just twenty-five years old. The\\r\\nmiddle daughter was now twenty-three, while the youngest, Aglaya, was\\r\\ntwenty. This youngest girl was absolutely a beauty, and had begun of\\r\\nlate to attract considerable attention in society. But this was not\\r\\nall, for every one of the three was clever, well educated, and\\r\\naccomplished.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a matter of general knowledge that the three girls were very\\r\\nfond of one another, and supported each other in every way; it was even\\r\\nsaid that the two elder ones had made certain sacrifices for the sake\\r\\nof the idol of the household, Aglaya. In society they not only disliked\\r\\nasserting themselves, but were actually retiring. Certainly no one\\r\\ncould blame them for being too arrogant or haughty, and yet everybody\\r\\nwas well aware that they were proud and quite understood their own\\r\\nvalue. The eldest was musical, while the second was a clever artist,\\r\\nwhich fact she had concealed until lately. In a word, the world spoke\\r\\nwell of the girls; but they were not without their enemies, and\\r\\noccasionally people talked with horror of the number of books they had\\r\\nread.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were in no hurry to marry. They liked good society, but were not\\r\\ntoo keen about it. All this was the more remarkable, because everyone\\r\\nwas well aware of the hopes and aims of their parents.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was about eleven oâ\\x80\\x99clock in the forenoon when the prince rang the\\r\\nbell at General Epanchinâ\\x80\\x99s door. The general lived on the first floor\\r\\nor flat of the house, as modest a lodging as his position permitted. A\\r\\nliveried servant opened the door, and the prince was obliged to enter\\r\\ninto long explanations with this gentleman, who, from the first glance,\\r\\nlooked at him and his bundle with grave suspicion. At last, however, on\\r\\nthe repeated positive assurance that he really was Prince Muishkin, and\\r\\nmust absolutely see the general on business, the bewildered domestic\\r\\nshowed him into a little ante-chamber leading to a waiting-room that\\r\\nadjoined the generalâ\\x80\\x99s study, there handing him over to another\\r\\nservant, whose duty it was to be in this ante-chamber all the morning,\\r\\nand announce visitors to the general. This second individual wore a\\r\\ndress coat, and was some forty years of age; he was the generalâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nspecial study servant, and well aware of his own importance.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWait in the next room, please; and leave your bundle here,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\r\\ndoor-keeper, as he sat down comfortably in his own easy-chair in the\\r\\nante-chamber. He looked at the prince in severe surprise as the latter\\r\\nsettled himself in another chair alongside, with his bundle on his\\r\\nknees.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf you donâ\\x80\\x99t mind, I would rather sit here with you,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince;\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI should prefer it to sitting in there.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, but you canâ\\x80\\x99t stay here. You are a visitorâ\\x80\\x94a guest, so to speak.\\r\\nIs it the general himself you wish to see?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man evidently could not take in the idea of such a shabby-looking\\r\\nvisitor, and had decided to ask once more.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYesâ\\x80\\x94I have businessâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d began the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI do not ask you what your business may be, all I have to do is to\\r\\nannounce you; and unless the secretary comes in here I cannot do that.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe manâ\\x80\\x99s suspicions seemed to increase more and more. The prince was\\r\\ntoo unlike the usual run of daily visitors; and although the general\\r\\ncertainly did receive, on business, all sorts and conditions of men,\\r\\nyet in spite of this fact the servant felt great doubts on the subject\\r\\nof this particular visitor. The presence of the secretary as an\\r\\nintermediary was, he judged, essential in this case.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSurely youâ\\x80\\x94are from abroad?â\\x80\\x9d he inquired at last, in a confused sort\\r\\nof way. He had begun his sentence intending to say, â\\x80\\x9cSurely you are not\\r\\nPrince Muishkin, are you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, straight from the train! Did not you intend to say, â\\x80\\x98Surely you\\r\\nare not Prince Muishkin?â\\x80\\x99 just now, but refrained out of politeness?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHâ\\x80\\x99m!â\\x80\\x9d grunted the astonished servant.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI assure you I am not deceiving you; you shall not have to answer for\\r\\nme. As to my being dressed like this, and carrying a bundle, thereâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nnothing surprising in thatâ\\x80\\x94the fact is, my circumstances are not\\r\\nparticularly rosy at this moment.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHâ\\x80\\x99m!â\\x80\\x94no, Iâ\\x80\\x99m not afraid of that, you see; I have to announce you,\\r\\nthatâ\\x80\\x99s all. The secretary will be out directlyâ\\x80\\x94that is, unless youâ\\x80\\x94yes,\\r\\nthatâ\\x80\\x99s the rubâ\\x80\\x94unless youâ\\x80\\x94come, you must allow me to ask youâ\\x80\\x94youâ\\x80\\x99ve not\\r\\ncome to beg, have you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh dear no, you can be perfectly easy on that score. I have quite\\r\\nanother matter on hand.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou must excuse my asking, you know. Your appearance led me to\\r\\nthinkâ\\x80\\x94but just wait for the secretary; the general is busy now, but the\\r\\nsecretary is sure to come out.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOhâ\\x80\\x94well, look here, if I have some time to wait, would you mind\\r\\ntelling me, is there any place about where I could have a smoke? I have\\r\\nmy pipe and tobacco with me.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Smoke?_â\\x80\\x9d said the man, in shocked but disdainful surprise, blinking\\r\\nhis eyes at the prince as though he could not believe his senses. â\\x80\\x9cNo,\\r\\nsir, you cannot smoke here, and I wonder you are not ashamed of the\\r\\nvery suggestion. Ha, ha! a cool idea that, I declare!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, I didnâ\\x80\\x99t mean in this room! I know I canâ\\x80\\x99t smoke here, of course.\\r\\nIâ\\x80\\x99d adjourn to some other room, wherever you like to show me to. You\\r\\nsee, Iâ\\x80\\x99m used to smoking a good deal, and now I havenâ\\x80\\x99t had a puff for\\r\\nthree hours; however, just as you like.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow how on earth am I to announce a man like that?â\\x80\\x9d muttered the\\r\\nservant. â\\x80\\x9cIn the first place, youâ\\x80\\x99ve no right in here at all; you ought\\r\\nto be in the waiting-room, because youâ\\x80\\x99re a sort of visitorâ\\x80\\x94a guest, in\\r\\nfactâ\\x80\\x94and I shall catch it for this. Look here, do you intend to take up\\r\\nyou abode with us?â\\x80\\x9d he added, glancing once more at the princeâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nbundle, which evidently gave him no peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I donâ\\x80\\x99t think so. I donâ\\x80\\x99t think I should stay even if they were to\\r\\ninvite me. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve simply come to make their acquaintance, and nothing\\r\\nmore.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMake their acquaintance?â\\x80\\x9d asked the man, in amazement, and with\\r\\nredoubled suspicion. â\\x80\\x9cThen why did you say you had business with the\\r\\ngeneral?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh well, very little business. There is one little matterâ\\x80\\x94some advice\\r\\nI am going to ask him for; but my principal object is simply to\\r\\nintroduce myself, because I am Prince Muishkin, and Madame Epanchin is\\r\\nthe last of her branch of the house, and besides herself and me there\\r\\nare no other Muishkins left.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x94youâ\\x80\\x99re a relation then, are you?â\\x80\\x9d asked the servant, so\\r\\nbewildered that he began to feel quite alarmed.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, hardly so. If you stretch a point, we are relations, of course,\\r\\nbut so distant that one cannot really take cognizance of it. I once\\r\\nwrote to your mistress from abroad, but she did not reply. However, I\\r\\nhave thought it right to make acquaintance with her on my arrival. I am\\r\\ntelling you all this in order to ease your mind, for I see you are\\r\\nstill far from comfortable on my account. All you have to do is to\\r\\nannounce me as Prince Muishkin, and the object of my visit will be\\r\\nplain enough. If I am receivedâ\\x80\\x94very good; if not, well, very good\\r\\nagain. But they are sure to receive me, I should think; Madame Epanchin\\r\\nwill naturally be curious to see the only remaining representative of\\r\\nher family. She values her Muishkin descent very highly, if I am\\r\\nrightly informed.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe princeâ\\x80\\x99s conversation was artless and confiding to a degree, and\\r\\nthe servant could not help feeling that as from visitor to common\\r\\nserving-man this state of things was highly improper. His conclusion\\r\\nwas that one of two things must be the explanationâ\\x80\\x94either that this was\\r\\na begging impostor, or that the prince, if prince he were, was simply a\\r\\nfool, without the slightest ambition; for a sensible prince with any\\r\\nambition would certainly not wait about in ante-rooms with servants,\\r\\nand talk of his own private affairs like this. In either case, how was\\r\\nhe to announce this singular visitor?\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI really think I must request you to step into the next room!â\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nsaid, with all the insistence he could muster.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy? If I had been sitting there now, I should not have had the\\r\\nopportunity of making these personal explanations. I see you are still\\r\\nuneasy about me and keep eyeing my cloak and bundle. Donâ\\x80\\x99t you think\\r\\nyou might go in yourself now, without waiting for the secretary to come\\r\\nout?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, no! I canâ\\x80\\x99t announce a visitor like yourself without the\\r\\nsecretary. Besides the general said he was not to be disturbedâ\\x80\\x94he is\\r\\nwith the Colonel Câ\\x80\\x94. Gavrila Ardalionovitch goes in without\\r\\nannouncing.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWho may that be? a clerk?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat? Gavrila Ardalionovitch? Oh no; he belongs to one of the\\r\\ncompanies. Look here, at all events put your bundle down, here.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I will if I may; andâ\\x80\\x94can I take off my cloakâ\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course; you canâ\\x80\\x99t go in _there_ with it on, anyhow.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince rose and took off his mantle, revealing a neat enough\\r\\nmorning costumeâ\\x80\\x94a little worn, but well made. He wore a steel watch\\r\\nchain and from this chain there hung a silver Geneva watch. Fool the\\r\\nprince might be, still, the generalâ\\x80\\x99s servant felt that it was not\\r\\ncorrect for him to continue to converse thus with a visitor, in spite\\r\\nof the fact that the prince pleased him somehow.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd what time of day does the lady receive?â\\x80\\x9d the latter asked,\\r\\nreseating himself in his old place.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, thatâ\\x80\\x99s not in _my_ province! I believe she receives at any time;\\r\\nit depends upon the visitors. The dressmaker goes in at eleven. Gavrila\\r\\nArdalionovitch is allowed much earlier than other people, too; he is\\r\\neven admitted to early lunch now and then.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is much warmer in the rooms here than it is abroad at this season,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nobserved the prince; â\\x80\\x9cbut it is much warmer there out of doors. As for\\r\\nthe housesâ\\x80\\x94a Russian canâ\\x80\\x99t live in them in the winter until he gets\\r\\naccustomed to them.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t they heat them at all?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, they do heat them a little; but the houses and stoves are so\\r\\ndifferent to ours.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHâ\\x80\\x99m! were you long away?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFour years! and I was in the same place nearly all the time,â\\x80\\x94in one\\r\\nvillage.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou must have forgotten Russia, hadnâ\\x80\\x99t you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, indeed I hadâ\\x80\\x94a good deal; and, would you believe it, I often\\r\\nwonder at myself for not having forgotten how to speak Russian? Even\\r\\nnow, as I talk to you, I keep saying to myself â\\x80\\x98how well I am speaking\\r\\nit.â\\x80\\x99 Perhaps that is partly why I am so talkative this morning. I\\r\\nassure you, ever since yesterday evening I have had the strongest\\r\\ndesire to go on and on talking Russian.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHâ\\x80\\x99m! yes; did you live in Petersburg in former years?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis good flunkey, in spite of his conscientious scruples, really could\\r\\nnot resist continuing such a very genteel and agreeable conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn Petersburg? Oh no! hardly at all, and now they say so much is\\r\\nchanged in the place that even those who did know it well are obliged\\r\\nto relearn what they knew. They talk a good deal about the new law\\r\\ncourts, and changes there, donâ\\x80\\x99t they?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHâ\\x80\\x99m! yes, thatâ\\x80\\x99s true enough. Well now, how is the law over there, do\\r\\nthey administer it more justly than here?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, I donâ\\x80\\x99t know about that! Iâ\\x80\\x99ve heard much that is good about our\\r\\nlegal administration, too. There is no capital punishment here for one\\r\\nthing.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs there over there?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYesâ\\x80\\x94I saw an execution in Franceâ\\x80\\x94at Lyons. Schneider took me over with\\r\\nhim to see it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat, did they hang the fellow?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, they cut off peopleâ\\x80\\x99s heads in France.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat did the fellow do?â\\x80\\x94yell?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh noâ\\x80\\x94itâ\\x80\\x99s the work of an instant. They put a man inside a frame and a\\r\\nsort of broad knife falls by machineryâ\\x80\\x94they call the thing a\\r\\nguillotineâ\\x80\\x94it falls with fearful force and weightâ\\x80\\x94the head springs off\\r\\nso quickly that you canâ\\x80\\x99t wink your eye in between. But all the\\r\\npreparations are so dreadful. When they announce the sentence, you\\r\\nknow, and prepare the criminal and tie his hands, and cart him off to\\r\\nthe scaffoldâ\\x80\\x94thatâ\\x80\\x99s the fearful part of the business. The people all\\r\\ncrowd roundâ\\x80\\x94even womenâ\\x80\\x94though they donâ\\x80\\x99t at all approve of women\\r\\nlooking on.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, itâ\\x80\\x99s not a thing for women.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course notâ\\x80\\x94of course not!â\\x80\\x94bah! The criminal was a fine intelligent\\r\\nfearless man; Le Gros was his name; and I may tell youâ\\x80\\x94believe it or\\r\\nnot, as you likeâ\\x80\\x94that when that man stepped upon the scaffold he\\r\\n_cried_, he did indeed,â\\x80\\x94he was as white as a bit of paper. Isnâ\\x80\\x99t it a\\r\\ndreadful idea that he should have criedâ\\x80\\x94cried! Whoever heard of a grown\\r\\nman crying from fearâ\\x80\\x94not a child, but a man who never had cried\\r\\nbeforeâ\\x80\\x94a grown man of forty-five years. Imagine what must have been\\r\\ngoing on in that manâ\\x80\\x99s mind at such a moment; what dreadful convulsions\\r\\nhis whole spirit must have endured; it is an outrage on the soul thatâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nwhat it is. Because it is said â\\x80\\x98thou shalt not kill,â\\x80\\x99 is he to be\\r\\nkilled because he murdered some one else? No, it is not right, itâ\\x80\\x99s an\\r\\nimpossible theory. I assure you, I saw the sight a month ago and itâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ndancing before my eyes to this moment. I dream of it, often.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince had grown animated as he spoke, and a tinge of colour\\r\\nsuffused his pale face, though his way of talking was as quiet as ever.\\r\\nThe servant followed his words with sympathetic interest. Clearly he\\r\\nwas not at all anxious to bring the conversation to an end. Who knows?\\r\\nPerhaps he too was a man of imagination and with some capacity for\\r\\nthought.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, at all events it is a good thing that thereâ\\x80\\x99s no pain when the\\r\\npoor fellowâ\\x80\\x99s head flies off,â\\x80\\x9d he remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you know, though,â\\x80\\x9d cried the prince warmly, â\\x80\\x9cyou made that remark\\r\\nnow, and everyone says the same thing, and the machine is designed with\\r\\nthe purpose of avoiding pain, this guillotine I mean; but a thought\\r\\ncame into my head then: what if it be a bad plan after all? You may\\r\\nlaugh at my idea, perhapsâ\\x80\\x94but I could not help its occurring to me all\\r\\nthe same. Now with the rack and tortures and so onâ\\x80\\x94you suffer terrible\\r\\npain of course; but then your torture is bodily pain only (although no\\r\\ndoubt you have plenty of that) until you die. But _here_ I should\\r\\nimagine the most terrible part of the whole punishment is, not the\\r\\nbodily pain at allâ\\x80\\x94but the certain knowledge that in an hour,â\\x80\\x94then in\\r\\nten minutes, then in half a minute, then nowâ\\x80\\x94this very _instant_â\\x80\\x94your\\r\\nsoul must quit your body and that you will no longer be a manâ\\x80\\x94and that\\r\\nthis is certain, _certain!_ Thatâ\\x80\\x99s the pointâ\\x80\\x94the certainty of it. Just\\r\\nthat instant when you place your head on the block and hear the iron\\r\\ngrate over your headâ\\x80\\x94thenâ\\x80\\x94that quarter of a second is the most awful of\\r\\nall.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis is not my own fantastical opinionâ\\x80\\x94many people have thought the\\r\\nsame; but I feel it so deeply that Iâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you what I think. I\\r\\nbelieve that to execute a man for murder is to punish him immeasurably\\r\\nmore dreadfully than is equivalent to his crime. A murder by sentence\\r\\nis far more dreadful than a murder committed by a criminal. The man who\\r\\nis attacked by robbers at night, in a dark wood, or anywhere,\\r\\nundoubtedly hopes and hopes that he may yet escape until the very\\r\\nmoment of his death. There are plenty of instances of a man running\\r\\naway, or imploring for mercyâ\\x80\\x94at all events hoping on in some\\r\\ndegreeâ\\x80\\x94even after his throat was cut. But in the case of an execution,\\r\\nthat last hopeâ\\x80\\x94having which it is so immeasurably less dreadful to\\r\\ndie,â\\x80\\x94is taken away from the wretch and _certainty_ substituted in its\\r\\nplace! There is his sentence, and with it that terrible certainty that\\r\\nhe cannot possibly escape deathâ\\x80\\x94which, I consider, must be the most\\r\\ndreadful anguish in the world. You may place a soldier before a\\r\\ncannonâ\\x80\\x99s mouth in battle, and fire upon himâ\\x80\\x94and he will still hope. But\\r\\nread to that same soldier his death-sentence, and he will either go mad\\r\\nor burst into tears. Who dares to say that any man can suffer this\\r\\nwithout going mad? No, no! it is an abuse, a shame, it is\\r\\nunnecessaryâ\\x80\\x94why should such a thing exist? Doubtless there may be men\\r\\nwho have been sentenced, who have suffered this mental anguish for a\\r\\nwhile and then have been reprieved; perhaps such men may have been able\\r\\nto relate their feelings afterwards. Our Lord Christ spoke of this\\r\\nanguish and dread. No! no! no! No man should be treated so, no man, no\\r\\nman!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe servant, though of course he could not have expressed all this as\\r\\nthe prince did, still clearly entered into it and was greatly\\r\\nconciliated, as was evident from the increased amiability of his\\r\\nexpression. â\\x80\\x9cIf you are really very anxious for a smoke,â\\x80\\x9d he remarked,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think it might possibly be managed, if you are very quick about it.\\r\\nYou see they might come out and inquire for you, and you wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be on\\r\\nthe spot. You see that door there? Go in there and youâ\\x80\\x99ll find a little\\r\\nroom on the right; you can smoke there, only open the window, because I\\r\\nought not to allow it really, andâ\\x80\\x94.â\\x80\\x9d But there was no time, after all.\\r\\n\\r\\nA young fellow entered the ante-room at this moment, with a bundle of\\r\\npapers in his hand. The footman hastened to help him take off his\\r\\novercoat. The new arrival glanced at the prince out of the corners of\\r\\nhis eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis gentleman declares, Gavrila Ardalionovitch,â\\x80\\x9d began the man,\\r\\nconfidentially and almost familiarly, â\\x80\\x9cthat he is Prince Muishkin and a\\r\\nrelative of Madame Epanchinâ\\x80\\x99s. He has just arrived from abroad, with\\r\\nnothing but a bundle by way of luggageâ\\x80\\x94.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince did not hear the rest, because at this point the servant\\r\\ncontinued his communication in a whisper.\\r\\n\\r\\nGavrila Ardalionovitch listened attentively, and gazed at the prince\\r\\nwith great curiosity. At last he motioned the man aside and stepped\\r\\nhurriedly towards the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAre you Prince Muishkin?â\\x80\\x9d he asked, with the greatest courtesy and\\r\\namiability.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was a remarkably handsome young fellow of some twenty-eight summers,\\r\\nfair and of middle height; he wore a small beard, and his face was most\\r\\nintelligent. Yet his smile, in spite of its sweetness, was a little\\r\\nthin, if I may so call it, and showed his teeth too evenly; his gaze\\r\\nthough decidedly good-humoured and ingenuous, was a trifle too\\r\\ninquisitive and intent to be altogether agreeable.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cProbably when he is alone he looks quite different, and hardly smiles\\r\\nat all!â\\x80\\x9d thought the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe explained about himself in a few words, very much the same as he had\\r\\ntold the footman and Rogojin beforehand.\\r\\n\\r\\nGavrila Ardalionovitch meanwhile seemed to be trying to recall\\r\\nsomething.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWas it not you, then, who sent a letter a year or less agoâ\\x80\\x94from\\r\\nSwitzerland, I think it wasâ\\x80\\x94to Elizabetha Prokofievna (Mrs. Epanchin)?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, then, of course they will remember who you are. You wish to see\\r\\nthe general? Iâ\\x80\\x99ll tell him at onceâ\\x80\\x94he will be free in a minute; but\\r\\nyouâ\\x80\\x94you had better wait in the ante-chamber,â\\x80\\x94hadnâ\\x80\\x99t you? Why is he\\r\\nhere?â\\x80\\x9d he added, severely, to the man.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI tell you, sir, he wished it himself!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this moment the study door opened, and a military man, with a\\r\\nportfolio under his arm, came out talking loudly, and after bidding\\r\\ngood-bye to someone inside, took his departure.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou there, Gania?â\\x80\\x9d cried a voice from the study, â\\x80\\x9ccome in here, will\\r\\nyou?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nGavrila Ardalionovitch nodded to the prince and entered the room\\r\\nhastily.\\r\\n\\r\\nA couple of minutes later the door opened again and the affable voice\\r\\nof Gania cried:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome in please, prince!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Ivan Fedorovitch Epanchin was standing in the middle of the\\r\\nroom, and gazed with great curiosity at the prince as he entered. He\\r\\neven advanced a couple of steps to meet him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince came forward and introduced himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuite so,â\\x80\\x9d replied the general, â\\x80\\x9cand what can I do for you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, I have no special business; my principal object was to make your\\r\\nacquaintance. I should not like to disturb you. I do not know your\\r\\ntimes and arrangements here, you see, but I have only just arrived. I\\r\\ncame straight from the station. I am come direct from Switzerland.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general very nearly smiled, but thought better of it and kept his\\r\\nsmile back. Then he reflected, blinked his eyes, stared at his guest\\r\\nonce more from head to foot; then abruptly motioned him to a chair, sat\\r\\ndown himself, and waited with some impatience for the prince to speak.\\r\\n\\r\\nGania stood at his table in the far corner of the room, turning over\\r\\npapers.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have not much time for making acquaintances, as a rule,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\r\\ngeneral, â\\x80\\x9cbut as, of course, you have your object in coming, Iâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI felt sure you would think I had some object in view when I resolved\\r\\nto pay you this visit,â\\x80\\x9d the prince interrupted; â\\x80\\x9cbut I give you my\\r\\nword, beyond the pleasure of making your acquaintance I had no personal\\r\\nobject whatever.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe pleasure is, of course, mutual; but life is not all pleasure, as\\r\\nyou are aware. There is such a thing as business, and I really do not\\r\\nsee what possible reason there can be, or what we have in common toâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, there is no reason, of course, and I suppose there is nothing in\\r\\ncommon between us, or very little; for if I am Prince Muishkin, and\\r\\nyour wife happens to be a member of my house, that can hardly be called\\r\\na â\\x80\\x98reason.â\\x80\\x99 I quite understand that. And yet that was my whole motive\\r\\nfor coming. You see I have not been in Russia for four years, and knew\\r\\nvery little about anything when I left. I had been very ill for a long\\r\\ntime, and I feel now the need of a few good friends. In fact, I have a\\r\\ncertain question upon which I much need advice, and do not know whom to\\r\\ngo to for it. I thought of your family when I was passing through\\r\\nBerlin. â\\x80\\x98They are almost relations,â\\x80\\x99 I said to myself, â\\x80\\x98so Iâ\\x80\\x99ll begin\\r\\nwith them; perhaps we may get on with each other, I with them and they\\r\\nwith me, if they are kind people;â\\x80\\x99 and I have heard that you are very\\r\\nkind people!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, thank you, thank you, Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure,â\\x80\\x9d replied the general, considerably\\r\\ntaken aback. â\\x80\\x9cMay I ask where you have taken up your quarters?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNowhere, as yet.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat, straight from the station to my house? And how about your\\r\\nluggage?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI only had a small bundle, containing linen, with me, nothing more. I\\r\\ncan carry it in my hand, easily. There will be plenty of time to take a\\r\\nroom in some hotel by the evening.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, then you _do_ intend to take a room?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTo judge from your words, you came straight to my house with the\\r\\nintention of staying there.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat could only have been on your invitation. I confess, however, that\\r\\nI should not have stayed here even if you had invited me, not for any\\r\\nparticular reason, but because it isâ\\x80\\x94well, contrary to my practice and\\r\\nnature, somehow.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, indeed! Then it is perhaps as well that I neither _did_ invite\\r\\nyou, nor _do_ invite you now. Excuse me, prince, but we had better make\\r\\nthis matter clear, once for all. We have just agreed that with regard\\r\\nto our relationship there is not much to be said, though, of course, it\\r\\nwould have been very delightful to us to feel that such relationship\\r\\ndid actually exist; therefore, perhapsâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTherefore, perhaps I had better get up and go away?â\\x80\\x9d said the prince,\\r\\nlaughing merrily as he rose from his place; just as merrily as though\\r\\nthe circumstances were by no means strained or difficult. â\\x80\\x9cAnd I give\\r\\nyou my word, general, that though I know nothing whatever of manners\\r\\nand customs of society, and how people live and all that, yet I felt\\r\\nquite sure that this visit of mine would end exactly as it has ended\\r\\nnow. Oh, well, I suppose itâ\\x80\\x99s all right; especially as my letter was\\r\\nnot answered. Well, good-bye, and forgive me for having disturbed you!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe princeâ\\x80\\x99s expression was so good-natured at this moment, and so\\r\\nentirely free from even a suspicion of unpleasant feeling was the smile\\r\\nwith which he looked at the general as he spoke, that the latter\\r\\nsuddenly paused, and appeared to gaze at his guest from quite a new\\r\\npoint of view, all in an instant.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you know, prince,â\\x80\\x9d he said, in quite a different tone, â\\x80\\x9cI do not\\r\\nknow you at all, yet, and after all, Elizabetha Prokofievna would very\\r\\nlikely be pleased to have a peep at a man of her own name. Wait a\\r\\nlittle, if you donâ\\x80\\x99t mind, and if you have time to spare?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, I assure you Iâ\\x80\\x99ve lots of time, my time is entirely my own!â\\x80\\x9d And\\r\\nthe prince immediately replaced his soft, round hat on the table. â\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nconfess, I thought Elizabetha Prokofievna would very likely remember\\r\\nthat I had written her a letter. Just now your servantâ\\x80\\x94outside\\r\\nthereâ\\x80\\x94was dreadfully suspicious that I had come to beg of you. I\\r\\nnoticed that! Probably he has very strict instructions on that score;\\r\\nbut I assure you I did not come to beg. I came to make some friends.\\r\\nBut I am rather bothered at having disturbed you; thatâ\\x80\\x99s all I care\\r\\nabout.â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLook here, prince,â\\x80\\x9d said the general, with a cordial smile, â\\x80\\x9cif you\\r\\nreally are the sort of man you appear to be, it may be a source of\\r\\ngreat pleasure to us to make your better acquaintance; but, you see, I\\r\\nam a very busy man, and have to be perpetually sitting here and signing\\r\\npapers, or off to see his excellency, or to my department, or\\r\\nsomewhere; so that though I should be glad to see more of people, nice\\r\\npeopleâ\\x80\\x94you see, Iâ\\x80\\x94however, I am sure you are so well brought up that\\r\\nyou will see at once, andâ\\x80\\x94but how old are you, prince?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTwenty-six.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo? I thought you very much younger.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, they say I have a â\\x80\\x98youngâ\\x80\\x99 face. As to disturbing you I shall soon\\r\\nlearn to avoid doing that, for I hate disturbing people. Besides, you\\r\\nand I are so differently constituted, I should think, that there must\\r\\nbe very little in common between us. Not that I will ever believe there\\r\\nis _nothing_ in common between any two people, as some declare is the\\r\\ncase. I am sure people make a great mistake in sorting each other into\\r\\ngroups, by appearances; but I am boring you, I see, youâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cJust two words: have you any means at all? Or perhaps you may be\\r\\nintending to undertake some sort of employment? Excuse my questioning\\r\\nyou, butâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, my dear sir, I esteem and understand your kindness in putting the\\r\\nquestion. No; at present I have no means whatever, and no employment\\r\\neither, but I hope to find some. I was living on other people abroad.\\r\\nSchneider, the professor who treated me and taught me, too, in\\r\\nSwitzerland, gave me just enough money for my journey, so that now I\\r\\nhave but a few copecks left. There certainly is one question upon which\\r\\nI am anxious to have advice, butâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTell me, how do you intend to live now, and what are your plans?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\ninterrupted the general.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI wish to work, somehow or other.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh yes, but then, you see, you are a philosopher. Have you any\\r\\ntalents, or ability in any directionâ\\x80\\x94that is, any that would bring in\\r\\nmoney and bread? Excuse me againâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, donâ\\x80\\x99t apologize. No, I donâ\\x80\\x99t think I have either talents or\\r\\nspecial abilities of any kind; on the contrary. I have always been an\\r\\ninvalid and unable to learn much. As for bread, I should thinkâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general interrupted once more with questions; while the prince\\r\\nagain replied with the narrative we have heard before. It appeared that\\r\\nthe general had known Pavlicheff; but why the latter had taken an\\r\\ninterest in the prince, that young gentleman could not explain;\\r\\nprobably by virtue of the old friendship with his father, he thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince had been left an orphan when quite a little child, and\\r\\nPavlicheff had entrusted him to an old lady, a relative of his own,\\r\\nliving in the country, the child needing the fresh air and exercise of\\r\\ncountry life. He was educated, first by a governess, and afterwards by\\r\\na tutor, but could not remember much about this time of his life. His\\r\\nfits were so frequent then, that they made almost an idiot of him (the\\r\\nprince used the expression â\\x80\\x9cidiotâ\\x80\\x9d himself). Pavlicheff had met\\r\\nProfessor Schneider in Berlin, and the latter had persuaded him to send\\r\\nthe boy to Switzerland, to Schneiderâ\\x80\\x99s establishment there, for the\\r\\ncure of his epilepsy, and, five years before this time, the prince was\\r\\nsent off. But Pavlicheff had died two or three years since, and\\r\\nSchneider had himself supported the young fellow, from that day to\\r\\nthis, at his own expense. Although he had not quite cured him, he had\\r\\ngreatly improved his condition; and now, at last, at the princeâ\\x80\\x99s own\\r\\ndesire, and because of a certain matter which came to the ears of the\\r\\nlatter, Schneider had despatched the young man to Russia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general was much astonished.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen you have no one, absolutely _no_ one in Russia?â\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo one, at present; but I hope to make friends; and then I have a\\r\\nletter fromâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAt all events,â\\x80\\x9d put in the general, not listening to the news about\\r\\nthe letter, â\\x80\\x9cat all events, you must have learned _something_, and your\\r\\nmalady would not prevent your undertaking some easy work, in one of the\\r\\ndepartments, for instance?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh dear no, oh no! As for a situation, I should much like to find one\\r\\nfor I am anxious to discover what I really am fit for. I have learned a\\r\\ngood deal in the last four years, and, besides, I read a great many\\r\\nRussian books.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cRussian books, indeed? Then, of course, you can read and write quite\\r\\ncorrectly?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh dear, yes!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCapital! And your handwriting?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, there I am _really_ talented! I may say I am a real caligraphist.\\r\\nLet me write you something, just to show you,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, with\\r\\nsome excitement.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWith pleasure! In fact, it is very necessary. I like your readiness,\\r\\nprince; in fact, I must sayâ\\x80\\x94Iâ\\x80\\x94Iâ\\x80\\x94like you very well, altogether,â\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nthe general.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat delightful writing materials you have here, such a lot of pencils\\r\\nand things, and what beautiful paper! Itâ\\x80\\x99s a charming room altogether.\\r\\nI know that picture, itâ\\x80\\x99s a Swiss view. Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure the artist painted it\\r\\nfrom nature, and that I have seen the very placeâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuite likely, though I bought it here. Gania, give the prince some\\r\\npaper. Here are pens and paper; now then, take this table. Whatâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nthis?â\\x80\\x9d the general continued to Gania, who had that moment taken a\\r\\nlarge photograph out of his portfolio, and shown it to his senior.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHalloa! Nastasia Philipovna! Did she send it you herself? Herself?â\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\ninquired, with much curiosity and great animation.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe gave it me just now, when I called in to congratulate her. I asked\\r\\nher for it long ago. I donâ\\x80\\x99t know whether she meant it for a hint that\\r\\nI had come empty-handed, without a present for her birthday, or what,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nadded Gania, with an unpleasant smile.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, nonsense, nonsense,â\\x80\\x9d said the general, with decision. â\\x80\\x9cWhat\\r\\nextraordinary ideas you have, Gania! As if she would hint; thatâ\\x80\\x99s not\\r\\nher way at all. Besides, what could _you_ give her, without having\\r\\nthousands at your disposal? You might have given her your portrait,\\r\\nhowever. Has she ever asked you for it?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, not yet. Very likely she never will. I suppose you havenâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nforgotten about tonight, have you, Ivan Fedorovitch? You were one of\\r\\nthose specially invited, you know.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh no, I remember all right, and I shall go, of course. I should think\\r\\nso! Sheâ\\x80\\x99s twenty-five years old today! And, you know, Gania, you must\\r\\nbe ready for great things; she has promised both myself and Afanasy\\r\\nIvanovitch that she will give a decided answer tonight, yes or no. So\\r\\nbe prepared!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nGania suddenly became so ill at ease that his face grew paler than\\r\\never.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAre you sure she said that?â\\x80\\x9d he asked, and his voice seemed to quiver\\r\\nas he spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, she promised. We both worried her so that she gave in; but she\\r\\nwished us to tell you nothing about it until the day.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general watched Ganiaâ\\x80\\x99s confusion intently, and clearly did not\\r\\nlike it.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cRemember, Ivan Fedorovitch,â\\x80\\x9d said Gania, in great agitation, â\\x80\\x9cthat I\\r\\nwas to be free too, until her decision; and that even then I was to\\r\\nhave my â\\x80\\x98yes or noâ\\x80\\x99 free.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, donâ\\x80\\x99t you, arenâ\\x80\\x99t youâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d began the general, in alarm.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, donâ\\x80\\x99t misunderstandâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut, my dear fellow, what are you doing, what do you mean?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, Iâ\\x80\\x99m not rejecting her. I may have expressed myself badly, but I\\r\\ndidnâ\\x80\\x99t mean that.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cReject her! I should think not!â\\x80\\x9d said the general with annoyance, and\\r\\napparently not in the least anxious to conceal it. â\\x80\\x9cWhy, my dear\\r\\nfellow, itâ\\x80\\x99s not a question of your rejecting her, it is whether you\\r\\nare prepared to receive her consent joyfully, and with proper\\r\\nsatisfaction. How are things going on at home?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAt home? Oh, I can do as I like there, of course; only my father will\\r\\nmake a fool of himself, as usual. He is rapidly becoming a general\\r\\nnuisance. I donâ\\x80\\x99t ever talk to him now, but I hold him in check, safe\\r\\nenough. I swear if it had not been for my mother, I should have shown\\r\\nhim the way out, long ago. My mother is always crying, of course, and\\r\\nmy sister sulks. I had to tell them at last that I intended to be\\r\\nmaster of my own destiny, and that I expect to be obeyed at home. At\\r\\nleast, I gave my sister to understand as much, and my mother was\\r\\npresent.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, I must say, I cannot understand it!â\\x80\\x9d said the general, shrugging\\r\\nhis shoulders and dropping his hands. â\\x80\\x9cYou remember your mother, Nina\\r\\nAlexandrovna, that day she came and sat here and groanedâ\\x80\\x94and when I\\r\\nasked her what was the matter, she says, â\\x80\\x98Oh, itâ\\x80\\x99s such a _dishonour_\\r\\nto us!â\\x80\\x99 dishonour! Stuff and nonsense! I should like to know who can\\r\\nreproach Nastasia Philipovna, or who can say a word of any kind against\\r\\nher. Did she mean because Nastasia had been living with Totski? What\\r\\nnonsense it is! You would not let her come near your daughters, says\\r\\nNina Alexandrovna. What next, I wonder? I donâ\\x80\\x99t see how she can fail\\r\\ntoâ\\x80\\x94to understandâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHer own position?â\\x80\\x9d prompted Gania. â\\x80\\x9cShe does understand. Donâ\\x80\\x99t be\\r\\nannoyed with her. I have warned her not to meddle in other peopleâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\naffairs. However, although thereâ\\x80\\x99s comparative peace at home at\\r\\npresent, the storm will break if anything is finally settled tonight.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince heard the whole of the foregoing conversation, as he sat at\\r\\nthe table, writing. He finished at last, and brought the result of his\\r\\nlabour to the generalâ\\x80\\x99s desk.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo this is Nastasia Philipovna,â\\x80\\x9d he said, looking attentively and\\r\\ncuriously at the portrait. â\\x80\\x9cHow wonderfully beautiful!â\\x80\\x9d he immediately\\r\\nadded, with warmth. The picture was certainly that of an unusually\\r\\nlovely woman. She was photographed in a black silk dress of simple\\r\\ndesign, her hair was evidently dark and plainly arranged, her eyes were\\r\\ndeep and thoughtful, the expression of her face passionate, but proud.\\r\\nShe was rather thin, perhaps, and a little pale. Both Gania and the\\r\\ngeneral gazed at the prince in amazement.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow do you know itâ\\x80\\x99s Nastasia Philipovna?â\\x80\\x9d asked the general; â\\x80\\x9cyou\\r\\nsurely donâ\\x80\\x99t know her already, do you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I do! I have only been one day in Russia, but I have heard of the\\r\\ngreat beauty!â\\x80\\x9d And the prince proceeded to narrate his meeting with\\r\\nRogojin in the train and the whole of the latterâ\\x80\\x99s story.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s news!â\\x80\\x9d said the general in some excitement, after listening to\\r\\nthe story with engrossed attention.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, of course itâ\\x80\\x99s nothing but humbug!â\\x80\\x9d cried Gania, a little\\r\\ndisturbed, however. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s all humbug; the young merchant was pleased to\\r\\nindulge in a little innocent recreation! I have heard something of\\r\\nRogojin!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, so have I!â\\x80\\x9d replied the general. â\\x80\\x9cNastasia Philipovna told us all\\r\\nabout the earrings that very day. But now it is quite a different\\r\\nmatter. You see the fellow really has a million of roubles, and he is\\r\\npassionately in love. The whole story smells of passion, and we all\\r\\nknow what this class of gentry is capable of when infatuated. I am much\\r\\nafraid of some disagreeable scandal, I am indeed!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are afraid of the million, I suppose,â\\x80\\x9d said Gania, grinning and\\r\\nshowing his teeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd you are _not_, I presume, eh?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow did he strike you, prince?â\\x80\\x9d asked Gania, suddenly. â\\x80\\x9cDid he seem to\\r\\nbe a serious sort of a man, or just a common rowdy fellow? What was\\r\\nyour own opinion about the matter?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Gania put this question, a new idea suddenly flashed into his\\r\\nbrain, and blazed out, impatiently, in his eyes. The general, who was\\r\\nreally agitated and disturbed, looked at the prince too, but did not\\r\\nseem to expect much from his reply.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI really donâ\\x80\\x99t quite know how to tell you,â\\x80\\x9d replied the prince, â\\x80\\x9cbut\\r\\nit certainly did seem to me that the man was full of passion, and not,\\r\\nperhaps, quite healthy passion. He seemed to be still far from well.\\r\\nVery likely he will be in bed again in a day or two, especially if he\\r\\nlives fast.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo! do you think so?â\\x80\\x9d said the general, catching at the idea.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I do think so!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, but the sort of scandal I referred to may happen at any moment.\\r\\nIt may be this very evening,â\\x80\\x9d remarked Gania to the general, with a\\r\\nsmile.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course; quite so. In that case it all depends upon what is going on\\r\\nin her brain at this moment.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou know the kind of person she is at times.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow? What kind of person is she?â\\x80\\x9d cried the general, arrived at the\\r\\nlimits of his patience. â\\x80\\x9cLook here, Gania, donâ\\x80\\x99t you go annoying her\\r\\ntonight. What you are to do is to be as agreeable towards her as ever\\r\\nyou can. Well, what are you smiling at? You must understand, Gania,\\r\\nthat I have no interest whatever in speaking like this. Whichever way\\r\\nthe question is settled, it will be to my advantage. Nothing will move\\r\\nTotski from his resolution, so I run no risk. If there is anything I\\r\\ndesire, you must know that it is your benefit only. Canâ\\x80\\x99t you trust me?\\r\\nYou are a sensible fellow, and I have been counting on you; for, in\\r\\nthis matter, that, thatâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, thatâ\\x80\\x99s the chief thing,â\\x80\\x9d said Gania, helping the general out of\\r\\nhis difficulties again, and curling his lips in an envenomed smile,\\r\\nwhich he did not attempt to conceal. He gazed with his fevered eyes\\r\\nstraight into those of the general, as though he were anxious that the\\r\\nlatter might read his thoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general grew purple with anger.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, of course it is the chief thing!â\\x80\\x9d he cried, looking sharply at\\r\\nGania. â\\x80\\x9cWhat a very curious man you are, Gania! You actually seem to be\\r\\n_glad_ to hear of this millionaire fellowâ\\x80\\x99s arrivalâ\\x80\\x94just as though you\\r\\nwished for an excuse to get out of the whole thing. This is an affair\\r\\nin which you ought to act honestly with both sides, and give due\\r\\nwarning, to avoid compromising others. But, even now, there is still\\r\\ntime. Do you understand me? I wish to know whether you desire this\\r\\narrangement or whether you do not? If not, say so,â\\x80\\x94andâ\\x80\\x94and welcome! No\\r\\none is trying to force you into the snare, Gavrila Ardalionovitch, if\\r\\nyou see a snare in the matter, at least.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI do desire it,â\\x80\\x9d murmured Gania, softly but firmly, lowering his eyes;\\r\\nand he relapsed into gloomy silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general was satisfied. He had excited himself, and was evidently\\r\\nnow regretting that he had gone so far. He turned to the prince, and\\r\\nsuddenly the disagreeable thought of the latterâ\\x80\\x99s presence struck him,\\r\\nand the certainty that he must have heard every word of the\\r\\nconversation. But he felt at ease in another moment; it only needed one\\r\\nglance at the prince to see that in that quarter there was nothing to\\r\\nfear.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh!â\\x80\\x9d cried the general, catching sight of the princeâ\\x80\\x99s specimen of\\r\\ncaligraphy, which the latter had now handed him for inspection. â\\x80\\x9cWhy,\\r\\nthis is simply beautiful; look at that, Gania, thereâ\\x80\\x99s real talent\\r\\nthere!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOn a sheet of thick writing-paper the prince had written in medieval\\r\\ncharacters the legend:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe gentle Abbot Pafnute signed this.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere,â\\x80\\x9d explained the prince, with great delight and animation,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthere, thatâ\\x80\\x99s the abbotâ\\x80\\x99s real signatureâ\\x80\\x94from a manuscript of the\\r\\nfourteenth century. All these old abbots and bishops used to write most\\r\\nbeautifully, with such taste and so much care and diligence. Have you\\r\\nno copy of Pogodin, general? If you had one I could show you another\\r\\ntype. Stop a bitâ\\x80\\x94here you have the large round writing common in France\\r\\nduring the eighteenth century. Some of the letters are shaped quite\\r\\ndifferently from those now in use. It was the writing current then, and\\r\\nemployed by public writers generally. I copied this from one of them,\\r\\nand you can see how good it is. Look at the well-rounded a and d. I\\r\\nhave tried to translate the French character into the Russian lettersâ\\x80\\x94a\\r\\ndifficult thing to do, but I think I have succeeded fairly. Here is a\\r\\nfine sentence, written in a good, original handâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98Zeal triumphs over\\r\\nall.â\\x80\\x99 That is the script of the Russian War Office. That is how\\r\\nofficial documents addressed to important personages should be written.\\r\\nThe letters are round, the type black, and the style somewhat\\r\\nremarkable. A stylist would not allow these ornaments, or attempts at\\r\\nflourishesâ\\x80\\x94just look at these unfinished tails!â\\x80\\x94but it has distinction\\r\\nand really depicts the soul of the writer. He would like to give play\\r\\nto his imagination, and follow the inspiration of his genius, but a\\r\\nsoldier is only at ease in the guard-room, and the pen stops half-way,\\r\\na slave to discipline. How delightful! The first time I met an example\\r\\nof this handwriting, I was positively astonished, and where do you\\r\\nthink I chanced to find it? In Switzerland, of all places! Now that is\\r\\nan ordinary English hand. It can hardly be improved, it is so refined\\r\\nand exquisiteâ\\x80\\x94almost perfection. This is an example of another kind, a\\r\\nmixture of styles. The copy was given me by a French commercial\\r\\ntraveller. It is founded on the English, but the downstrokes are a\\r\\nlittle blacker, and more marked. Notice that the oval has some slight\\r\\nmodificationâ\\x80\\x94it is more rounded. This writing allows for flourishes;\\r\\nnow a flourish is a dangerous thing! Its use requires such taste, but,\\r\\nif successful, what a distinction it gives to the whole! It results in\\r\\nan incomparable typeâ\\x80\\x94one to fall in love with!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDear me! How you have gone into all the refinements and details of the\\r\\nquestion! Why, my dear fellow, you are not a caligraphist, you are an\\r\\nartist! Eh, Gania?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWonderful!â\\x80\\x9d said Gania. â\\x80\\x9cAnd he knows it too,â\\x80\\x9d he added, with a\\r\\nsarcastic smile.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou may smile,â\\x80\\x94but thereâ\\x80\\x99s a career in this,â\\x80\\x9d said the general. â\\x80\\x9cYou\\r\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t know what a great personage I shall show this to, prince. Why,\\r\\nyou can command a situation at thirty-five roubles per month to start\\r\\nwith. However, itâ\\x80\\x99s half-past twelve,â\\x80\\x9d he concluded, looking at his\\r\\nwatch; â\\x80\\x9cso to business, prince, for I must be setting to work and shall\\r\\nnot see you again today. Sit down a minute. I have told you that I\\r\\ncannot receive you myself very often, but I should like to be of some\\r\\nassistance to you, some small assistance, of a kind that would give you\\r\\nsatisfaction. I shall find you a place in one of the State departments,\\r\\nan easy placeâ\\x80\\x94but you will require to be accurate. Now, as to your\\r\\nplansâ\\x80\\x94in the house, or rather in the family of Gania hereâ\\x80\\x94my young\\r\\nfriend, whom I hope you will know betterâ\\x80\\x94his mother and sister have\\r\\nprepared two or three rooms for lodgers, and let them to highly\\r\\nrecommended young fellows, with board and attendance. I am sure Nina\\r\\nAlexandrovna will take you in on my recommendation. There you will be\\r\\ncomfortable and well taken care of; for I do not think, prince, that\\r\\nyou are the sort of man to be left to the mercy of Fate in a town like\\r\\nPetersburg. Nina Alexandrovna, Ganiaâ\\x80\\x99s mother, and Varvara\\r\\nAlexandrovna, are ladies for whom I have the highest possible esteem\\r\\nand respect. Nina Alexandrovna is the wife of General Ardalion\\r\\nAlexandrovitch, my old brother in arms, with whom, I regret to say, on\\r\\naccount of certain circumstances, I am no longer acquainted. I give you\\r\\nall this information, prince, in order to make it clear to you that I\\r\\nam personally recommending you to this family, and that in so doing, I\\r\\nam more or less taking upon myself to answer for you. The terms are\\r\\nmost reasonable, and I trust that your salary will very shortly prove\\r\\namply sufficient for your expenditure. Of course pocket-money is a\\r\\nnecessity, if only a little; do not be angry, prince, if I strongly\\r\\nrecommend you to avoid carrying money in your pocket. But as your purse\\r\\nis quite empty at the present moment, you must allow me to press these\\r\\ntwenty-five roubles upon your acceptance, as something to begin with.\\r\\nOf course we will settle this little matter another time, and if you\\r\\nare the upright, honest man you look, I anticipate very little trouble\\r\\nbetween us on that score. Taking so much interest in you as you may\\r\\nperceive I do, I am not without my object, and you shall know it in\\r\\ngood time. You see, I am perfectly candid with you. I hope, Gania, you\\r\\nhave nothing to say against the princeâ\\x80\\x99s taking up his abode in your\\r\\nhouse?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, on the contrary! my mother will be very glad,â\\x80\\x9d said Gania,\\r\\ncourteously and kindly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think only one of your rooms is engaged as yet, is it not? That\\r\\nfellow Ferd-Ferdâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFerdishenko.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYesâ\\x80\\x94I donâ\\x80\\x99t like that Ferdishenko. I canâ\\x80\\x99t understand why Nastasia\\r\\nPhilipovna encourages him so. Is he really her cousin, as he says?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh dear no, itâ\\x80\\x99s all a joke. No more cousin than I am.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, what do you think of the arrangement, prince?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank you, general; you have behaved very kindly to me; all the more\\r\\nso since I did not ask you to help me. I donâ\\x80\\x99t say that out of pride. I\\r\\ncertainly did not know where to lay my head tonight. Rogojin asked me\\r\\nto come to his house, of course, butâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cRogojin? No, no, my good fellow. I should strongly recommend you,\\r\\npaternally,â\\x80\\x94or, if you prefer it, as a friend,â\\x80\\x94to forget all about\\r\\nRogojin, and, in fact, to stick to the family into which you are about\\r\\nto enter.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank you,â\\x80\\x9d began the prince; â\\x80\\x9cand since you are so very kind there is\\r\\njust one matter which Iâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou must really excuse me,â\\x80\\x9d interrupted the general, â\\x80\\x9cbut I positively\\r\\nhavenâ\\x80\\x99t another moment now. I shall just tell Elizabetha Prokofievna\\r\\nabout you, and if she wishes to receive you at onceâ\\x80\\x94as I shall advise\\r\\nherâ\\x80\\x94I strongly recommend you to ingratiate yourself with her at the\\r\\nfirst opportunity, for my wife may be of the greatest service to you in\\r\\nmany ways. If she cannot receive you now, you must be content to wait\\r\\ntill another time. Meanwhile you, Gania, just look over these accounts,\\r\\nwill you? We mustnâ\\x80\\x99t forget to finish off that matterâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general left the room, and the prince never succeeded in broaching\\r\\nthe business which he had on hand, though he had endeavoured to do so\\r\\nfour times.\\r\\n\\r\\nGania lit a cigarette and offered one to the prince. The latter\\r\\naccepted the offer, but did not talk, being unwilling to disturb\\r\\nGaniaâ\\x80\\x99s work. He commenced to examine the study and its contents. But\\r\\nGania hardly so much as glanced at the papers lying before him; he was\\r\\nabsent and thoughtful, and his smile and general appearance struck the\\r\\nprince still more disagreeably now that the two were left alone\\r\\ntogether.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly Gania approached our hero who was at the moment standing over\\r\\nNastasia Philipovnaâ\\x80\\x99s portrait, gazing at it.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you admire that sort of woman, prince?â\\x80\\x9d he asked, looking intently\\r\\nat him. He seemed to have some special object in the question.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a wonderful face,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, â\\x80\\x9cand I feel sure that her\\r\\ndestiny is not by any means an ordinary, uneventful one. Her face is\\r\\nsmiling enough, but she must have suffered terriblyâ\\x80\\x94hasnâ\\x80\\x99t she? Her\\r\\neyes show itâ\\x80\\x94those two bones there, the little points under her eyes,\\r\\njust where the cheek begins. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a proud face too, terribly proud! And\\r\\nIâ\\x80\\x94I canâ\\x80\\x99t say whether she is good and kind, or not. Oh, if she be but\\r\\ngood! That would make all well!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd would you marry a woman like that, now?â\\x80\\x9d continued Gania, never\\r\\ntaking his excited eyes off the princeâ\\x80\\x99s face.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI cannot marry at all,â\\x80\\x9d said the latter. â\\x80\\x9cI am an invalid.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWould Rogojin marry her, do you think?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy not? Certainly he would, I should think. He would marry her\\r\\ntomorrow!â\\x80\\x94marry her tomorrow and murder her in a week!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHardly had the prince uttered the last word when Gania gave such a\\r\\nfearful shudder that the prince almost cried out.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s the matter?â\\x80\\x9d said he, seizing Ganiaâ\\x80\\x99s hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYour highness! His excellency begs your presence in her excellencyâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\napartments!â\\x80\\x9d announced the footman, appearing at the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince immediately followed the man out of the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nIV.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll three of the Miss Epanchins were fine, healthy girls, well-grown,\\r\\nwith good shoulders and busts, and strongâ\\x80\\x94almost masculineâ\\x80\\x94hands; and,\\r\\nof course, with all the above attributes, they enjoyed capital\\r\\nappetites, of which they were not in the least ashamed.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabetha Prokofievna sometimes informed the girls that they were a\\r\\nlittle too candid in this matter, but in spite of their outward\\r\\ndeference to their mother these three young women, in solemn conclave,\\r\\nhad long agreed to modify the unquestioning obedience which they had\\r\\nbeen in the habit of according to her; and Mrs. General Epanchin had\\r\\njudged it better to say nothing about it, though, of course, she was\\r\\nwell aware of the fact.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is true that her nature sometimes rebelled against these dictates of\\r\\nreason, and that she grew yearly more capricious and impatient; but\\r\\nhaving a respectful and well-disciplined husband under her thumb at all\\r\\ntimes, she found it possible, as a rule, to empty any little\\r\\naccumulations of spleen upon his head, and therefore the harmony of the\\r\\nfamily was kept duly balanced, and things went as smoothly as family\\r\\nmatters can.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Epanchin had a fair appetite herself, and generally took her share\\r\\nof the capital mid-day lunch which was always served for the girls, and\\r\\nwhich was nearly as good as a dinner. The young ladies used to have a\\r\\ncup of coffee each before this meal, at ten oâ\\x80\\x99clock, while still in\\r\\nbed. This was a favourite and unalterable arrangement with them. At\\r\\nhalf-past twelve, the table was laid in the small dining-room, and\\r\\noccasionally the general himself appeared at the family gathering, if\\r\\nhe had time.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides tea and coffee, cheese, honey, butter, pan-cakes of various\\r\\nkinds (the lady of the house loved these best), cutlets, and so on,\\r\\nthere was generally strong beef soup, and other substantial delicacies.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the particular morning on which our story has opened, the family had\\r\\nassembled in the dining-room, and were waiting the generalâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nappearance, the latter having promised to come this day. If he had been\\r\\none moment late, he would have been sent for at once; but he turned up\\r\\npunctually.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he came forward to wish his wife good-morning and kiss her hands, as\\r\\nhis custom was, he observed something in her look which boded ill. He\\r\\nthought he knew the reason, and had expected it, but still, he was not\\r\\naltogether comfortable. His daughters advanced to kiss him, too, and\\r\\nthough they did not look exactly angry, there was something strange in\\r\\ntheir expression as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general was, owing to certain circumstances, a little inclined to\\r\\nbe too suspicious at home, and needlessly nervous; but, as an\\r\\nexperienced father and husband, he judged it better to take measures at\\r\\nonce to protect himself from any dangers there might be in the air.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, I hope I shall not interfere with the proper sequence of my\\r\\nnarrative too much, if I diverge for a moment at this point, in order\\r\\nto explain the mutual relations between General Epanchinâ\\x80\\x99s family and\\r\\nothers acting a part in this history, at the time when we take up the\\r\\nthread of their destiny. I have already stated that the general, though\\r\\nhe was a man of lowly origin, and of poor education, was, for all that,\\r\\nan experienced and talented husband and father. Among other things, he\\r\\nconsidered it undesirable to hurry his daughters to the matrimonial\\r\\naltar and to worry them too much with assurances of his paternal wishes\\r\\nfor their happiness, as is the custom among parents of many grown-up\\r\\ndaughters. He even succeeded in ranging his wife on his side on this\\r\\nquestion, though he found the feat very difficult to accomplish,\\r\\nbecause unnatural; but the generalâ\\x80\\x99s arguments were conclusive, and\\r\\nfounded upon obvious facts. The general considered that the girlsâ\\x80\\x99\\r\\ntaste and good sense should be allowed to develop and mature\\r\\ndeliberately, and that the parentsâ\\x80\\x99 duty should merely be to keep\\r\\nwatch, in order that no strange or undesirable choice be made; but that\\r\\nthe selection once effected, both father and mother were bound from\\r\\nthat moment to enter heart and soul into the cause, and to see that the\\r\\nmatter progressed without hindrance until the altar should be happily\\r\\nreached.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides this, it was clear that the Epanchinsâ\\x80\\x99 position gained each\\r\\nyear, with geometrical accuracy, both as to financial solidity and\\r\\nsocial weight; and, therefore, the longer the girls waited, the better\\r\\nwas their chance of making a brilliant match.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut again, amidst the incontrovertible facts just recorded, one more,\\r\\nequally significant, rose up to confront the family; and this was, that\\r\\nthe eldest daughter, Alexandra, had imperceptibly arrived at her\\r\\ntwenty-fifth birthday. Almost at the same moment, Afanasy Ivanovitch\\r\\nTotski, a man of immense wealth, high connections, and good standing,\\r\\nannounced his intention of marrying. Afanasy Ivanovitch was a gentleman\\r\\nof fifty-five years of age, artistically gifted, and of most refined\\r\\ntastes. He wished to marry well, and, moreover, he was a keen admirer\\r\\nand judge of beauty.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, since Totski had, of late, been upon terms of great cordiality\\r\\nwith Epanchin, which excellent relations were intensified by the fact\\r\\nthat they were, so to speak, partners in several financial enterprises,\\r\\nit so happened that the former now put in a friendly request to the\\r\\ngeneral for counsel with regard to the important step he meditated.\\r\\nMight he suggest, for instance, such a thing as a marriage between\\r\\nhimself and one of the generalâ\\x80\\x99s daughters?\\r\\n\\r\\nEvidently the quiet, pleasant current of the family life of the\\r\\nEpanchins was about to undergo a change.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe undoubted beauty of the family, _par excellence_, was the youngest,\\r\\nAglaya, as aforesaid. But Totski himself, though an egotist of the\\r\\nextremest type, realized that he had no chance there; Aglaya was\\r\\nclearly not for such as he.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps the sisterly love and friendship of the three girls had more or\\r\\nless exaggerated Aglayaâ\\x80\\x99s chances of happiness. In their opinion, the\\r\\nlatterâ\\x80\\x99s destiny was not merely to be very happy; she was to live in a\\r\\nheaven on earth. Aglayaâ\\x80\\x99s husband was to be a compendium of all the\\r\\nvirtues, and of all success, not to speak of fabulous wealth. The two\\r\\nelder sisters had agreed that all was to be sacrificed by them, if need\\r\\nbe, for Aglayaâ\\x80\\x99s sake; her dowry was to be colossal and unprecedented.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general and his wife were aware of this agreement, and, therefore,\\r\\nwhen Totski suggested himself for one of the sisters, the parents made\\r\\nno doubt that one of the two elder girls would probably accept the\\r\\noffer, since Totski would certainly make no difficulty as to dowry. The\\r\\ngeneral valued the proposal very highly. He knew life, and realized\\r\\nwhat such an offer was worth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe answer of the sisters to the communication was, if not conclusive,\\r\\nat least consoling and hopeful. It made known that the eldest,\\r\\nAlexandra, would very likely be disposed to listen to a proposal.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlexandra was a good-natured girl, though she had a will of her own.\\r\\nShe was intelligent and kind-hearted, and, if she were to marry Totski,\\r\\nshe would make him a good wife. She did not care for a brilliant\\r\\nmarriage; she was eminently a woman calculated to soothe and sweeten\\r\\nthe life of any man; decidedly pretty, if not absolutely handsome. What\\r\\nbetter could Totski wish?\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the matter crept slowly forward. The general and Totski had agreed\\r\\nto avoid any hasty and irrevocable step. Alexandraâ\\x80\\x99s parents had not\\r\\neven begun to talk to their daughters freely upon the subject, when\\r\\nsuddenly, as it were, a dissonant chord was struck amid the harmony of\\r\\nthe proceedings. Mrs. Epanchin began to show signs of discontent, and\\r\\nthat was a serious matter. A certain circumstance had crept in, a\\r\\ndisagreeable and troublesome factor, which threatened to overturn the\\r\\nwhole business.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis circumstance had come into existence eighteen years before. Close\\r\\nto an estate of Totskiâ\\x80\\x99s, in one of the central provinces of Russia,\\r\\nthere lived, at that time, a poor gentleman whose estate was of the\\r\\nwretchedest description. This gentleman was noted in the district for\\r\\nhis persistent ill-fortune; his name was Barashkoff, and, as regards\\r\\nfamily and descent, he was vastly superior to Totski, but his estate\\r\\nwas mortgaged to the last acre. One day, when he had ridden over to the\\r\\ntown to see a creditor, the chief peasant of his village followed him\\r\\nshortly after, with the news that his house had been burnt down, and\\r\\nthat his wife had perished with it, but his children were safe.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven Barashkoff, inured to the storms of evil fortune as he was, could\\r\\nnot stand this last stroke. He went mad and died shortly after in the\\r\\ntown hospital. His estate was sold for the creditors; and the little\\r\\ngirlsâ\\x80\\x94two of them, of seven and eight years of age respectively,â\\x80\\x94were\\r\\nadopted by Totski, who undertook their maintenance and education in the\\r\\nkindness of his heart. They were brought up together with the children\\r\\nof his German bailiff. Very soon, however, there was only one of them\\r\\nleftâ\\x80\\x94Nastasia Philipovnaâ\\x80\\x94for the other little one died of\\r\\nwhooping-cough. Totski, who was living abroad at this time, very soon\\r\\nforgot all about the child; but five years after, returning to Russia,\\r\\nit struck him that he would like to look over his estate and see how\\r\\nmatters were going there, and, arrived at his bailiffâ\\x80\\x99s house, he was\\r\\nnot long in discovering that among the children of the latter there now\\r\\ndwelt a most lovely little girl of twelve, sweet and intelligent, and\\r\\nbright, and promising to develop beauty of most unusual qualityâ\\x80\\x94as to\\r\\nwhich last Totski was an undoubted authority.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe only stayed at his country seat a few days on this occasion, but he\\r\\nhad time to make his arrangements. Great changes took place in the\\r\\nchildâ\\x80\\x99s education; a good governess was engaged, a Swiss lady of\\r\\nexperience and culture. For four years this lady resided in the house\\r\\nwith little Nastia, and then the education was considered complete. The\\r\\ngoverness took her departure, and another lady came down to fetch\\r\\nNastia, by Totskiâ\\x80\\x99s instructions. The child was now transported to\\r\\nanother of Totskiâ\\x80\\x99s estates in a distant part of the country. Here she\\r\\nfound a delightful little house, just built, and prepared for her\\r\\nreception with great care and taste; and here she took up her abode\\r\\ntogether with the lady who had accompanied her from her old home. In\\r\\nthe house there were two experienced maids, musical instruments of all\\r\\nsorts, a charming â\\x80\\x9cyoung ladyâ\\x80\\x99s library,â\\x80\\x9d pictures, paint-boxes, a\\r\\nlap-dog, and everything to make life agreeable. Within a fortnight\\r\\nTotski himself arrived, and from that time he appeared to have taken a\\r\\ngreat fancy to this part of the world and came down each summer,\\r\\nstaying two and three months at a time. So passed four years peacefully\\r\\nand happily, in charming surroundings.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of that time, and about four months after Totskiâ\\x80\\x99s last\\r\\nvisit (he had stayed but a fortnight on this occasion), a report\\r\\nreached Nastasia Philipovna that he was about to be married in St.\\r\\nPetersburg, to a rich, eminent, and lovely woman. The report was only\\r\\npartially true, the marriage project being only in an embryo condition;\\r\\nbut a great change now came over Nastasia Philipovna. She suddenly\\r\\ndisplayed unusual decision of character; and without wasting time in\\r\\nthought, she left her country home and came up to St. Petersburg,\\r\\nstraight to Totskiâ\\x80\\x99s house, all alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe latter, amazed at her conduct, began to express his displeasure;\\r\\nbut he very soon became aware that he must change his voice, style, and\\r\\neverything else, with this young lady; the good old times were gone. An\\r\\nentirely new and different woman sat before him, between whom and the\\r\\ngirl he had left in the country last July there seemed nothing in\\r\\ncommon.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first place, this new woman understood a good deal more than was\\r\\nusual for young people of her age; so much indeed, that Totski could\\r\\nnot help wondering where she had picked up her knowledge. Surely not\\r\\nfrom her â\\x80\\x9cyoung ladyâ\\x80\\x99s libraryâ\\x80\\x9d? It even embraced legal matters, and\\r\\nthe â\\x80\\x9cworldâ\\x80\\x9d in general, to a considerable extent.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer character was absolutely changed. No more of the girlish\\r\\nalternations of timidity and petulance, the adorable naivete, the\\r\\nreveries, the tears, the playfulness... It was an entirely new and\\r\\nhitherto unknown being who now sat and laughed at him, and informed him\\r\\nto his face that she had never had the faintest feeling for him of any\\r\\nkind, except loathing and contemptâ\\x80\\x94contempt which had followed closely\\r\\nupon her sensations of surprise and bewilderment after her first\\r\\nacquaintance with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis new woman gave him further to understand that though it was\\r\\nabsolutely the same to her whom he married, yet she had decided to\\r\\nprevent this marriageâ\\x80\\x94for no particular reason, but that she _chose_ to\\r\\ndo so, and because she wished to amuse herself at his expense for that\\r\\nit was â\\x80\\x9cquite her turn to laugh a little now!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch were her wordsâ\\x80\\x94very likely she did not give her real reason for\\r\\nthis eccentric conduct; but, at all events, that was all the\\r\\nexplanation she deigned to offer.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, Totski thought the matter over as well as his scattered\\r\\nideas would permit. His meditations lasted a fortnight, however, and at\\r\\nthe end of that time his resolution was taken. The fact was, Totski was\\r\\nat that time a man of fifty years of age; his position was solid and\\r\\nrespectable; his place in society had long been firmly fixed upon safe\\r\\nfoundations; he loved himself, his personal comforts, and his position\\r\\nbetter than all the world, as every respectable gentleman should!\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time his grasp of things in general soon showed Totski that\\r\\nhe now had to deal with a being who was outside the pale of the\\r\\nordinary rules of traditional behaviour, and who would not only\\r\\nthreaten mischief but would undoubtedly carry it out, and stop for no\\r\\none.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was evidently, he concluded, something at work here; some storm\\r\\nof the mind, some paroxysm of romantic anger, goodness knows against\\r\\nwhom or what, some insatiable contemptâ\\x80\\x94in a word, something altogether\\r\\nabsurd and impossible, but at the same time most dangerous to be met\\r\\nwith by any respectable person with a position in society to keep up.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a man of Totskiâ\\x80\\x99s wealth and standing, it would, of course, have\\r\\nbeen the simplest possible matter to take steps which would rid him at\\r\\nonce from all annoyance; while it was obviously impossible for Nastasia\\r\\nPhilipovna to harm him in any way, either legally or by stirring up a\\r\\nscandal, for, in case of the latter danger, he could so easily remove\\r\\nher to a sphere of safety. However, these arguments would only hold\\r\\ngood in case of Nastasia acting as others might in such an emergency.\\r\\nShe was much more likely to overstep the bounds of reasonable conduct\\r\\nby some extraordinary eccentricity.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere the sound judgment of Totski stood him in good stead. He realized\\r\\nthat Nastasia Philipovna must be well aware that she could do nothing\\r\\nby legal means to injure him, and that her flashing eyes betrayed some\\r\\nentirely different intention.\\r\\n\\r\\nNastasia Philipovna was quite capable of ruining herself, and even of\\r\\nperpetrating something which would send her to Siberia, for the mere\\r\\npleasure of injuring a man for whom she had developed so inhuman a\\r\\nsense of loathing and contempt. He had sufficient insight to understand\\r\\nthat she valued nothing in the worldâ\\x80\\x94herself least of allâ\\x80\\x94and he made\\r\\nno attempt to conceal the fact that he was a coward in some respects.\\r\\nFor instance, if he had been told that he would be stabbed at the\\r\\naltar, or publicly insulted, he would undoubtedly have been frightened;\\r\\nbut not so much at the idea of being murdered, or wounded, or insulted,\\r\\nas at the thought that if such things were to happen he would be made\\r\\nto look ridiculous in the eyes of society.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe knew well that Nastasia thoroughly understood him and where to wound\\r\\nhim and how, and therefore, as the marriage was still only in embryo,\\r\\nTotski decided to conciliate her by giving it up. His decision was\\r\\nstrengthened by the fact that Nastasia Philipovna had curiously altered\\r\\nof late. It would be difficult to conceive how different she was\\r\\nphysically, at the present time, to the girl of a few years ago. She\\r\\nwas pretty then... but now!... Totski laughed angrily when he thought\\r\\nhow short-sighted he had been. In days gone by he remembered how he had\\r\\nlooked at her beautiful eyes, how even then he had marvelled at their\\r\\ndark mysterious depths, and at their wondering gaze which seemed to\\r\\nseek an answer to some unknown riddle. Her complexion also had altered.\\r\\nShe was now exceedingly pale, but, curiously, this change only made her\\r\\nmore beautiful. Like most men of the world, Totski had rather despised\\r\\nsuch a cheaply-bought conquest, but of late years he had begun to think\\r\\ndifferently about it. It had struck him as long ago as last spring that\\r\\nhe ought to be finding a good match for Nastasia; for instance, some\\r\\nrespectable and reasonable young fellow serving in a government office\\r\\nin another part of the country. How maliciously Nastasia laughed at the\\r\\nidea of such a thing, now!\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, it appeared to Totski that he might make use of her in another\\r\\nway; and he determined to establish her in St. Petersburg, surrounding\\r\\nher with all the comforts and luxuries that his wealth could command.\\r\\nIn this way he might gain glory in certain circles.\\r\\n\\r\\nFive years of this Petersburg life went by, and, of course, during that\\r\\ntime a great deal happened. Totskiâ\\x80\\x99s position was very uncomfortable;\\r\\nhaving â\\x80\\x9cfunkedâ\\x80\\x9d once, he could not totally regain his ease. He was\\r\\nafraid, he did not know why, but he was simply _afraid_ of Nastasia\\r\\nPhilipovna. For the first two years or so he had suspected that she\\r\\nwished to marry him herself, and that only her vanity prevented her\\r\\ntelling him so. He thought that she wanted him to approach her with a\\r\\nhumble proposal from his own side. But to his great, and not entirely\\r\\npleasurable amazement, he discovered that this was by no means the\\r\\ncase, and that were he to offer himself he would be refused. He could\\r\\nnot understand such a state of things, and was obliged to conclude that\\r\\nit was pride, the pride of an injured and imaginative woman, which had\\r\\ngone to such lengths that it preferred to sit and nurse its contempt\\r\\nand hatred in solitude rather than mount to heights of hitherto\\r\\nunattainable splendour. To make matters worse, she was quite impervious\\r\\nto mercenary considerations, and could not be bribed in any way.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, Totski took cunning means to try to break his chains and be\\r\\nfree. He tried to tempt her in various ways to lose her heart; he\\r\\ninvited princes, hussars, secretaries of embassies, poets, novelists,\\r\\neven Socialists, to see her; but not one of them all made the faintest\\r\\nimpression upon Nastasia. It was as though she had a pebble in place of\\r\\na heart, as though her feelings and affections were dried up and\\r\\nwithered for ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe lived almost entirely alone; she read, she studied, she loved\\r\\nmusic. Her principal acquaintances were poor women of various grades, a\\r\\ncouple of actresses, and the family of a poor schoolteacher. Among\\r\\nthese people she was much beloved.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe received four or five friends sometimes, of an evening. Totski\\r\\noften came. Lately, too, General Epanchin had been enabled with great\\r\\ndifficulty to introduce himself into her circle. Gania made her\\r\\nacquaintance also, and others were Ferdishenko, an ill-bred, and\\r\\nwould-be witty, young clerk, and Ptitsin, a money-lender of modest and\\r\\npolished manners, who had risen from poverty. In fact, Nastasia\\r\\nPhilipovnaâ\\x80\\x99s beauty became a thing known to all the town; but not a\\r\\nsingle man could boast of anything more than his own admiration for\\r\\nher; and this reputation of hers, and her wit and culture and grace,\\r\\nall confirmed Totski in the plan he had now prepared.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it was at this moment that General Epanchin began to play so large\\r\\nand important a part in the story.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Totski had approached the general with his request for friendly\\r\\ncounsel as to a marriage with one of his daughters, he had made a full\\r\\nand candid confession. He had said that he intended to stop at no means\\r\\nto obtain his freedom; even if Nastasia were to promise to leave him\\r\\nentirely alone in future, he would not (he said) believe and trust her;\\r\\nwords were not enough for him; he must have solid guarantees of some\\r\\nsort. So he and the general determined to try what an attempt to appeal\\r\\nto her heart would effect. Having arrived at Nastasiaâ\\x80\\x99s house one day,\\r\\nwith Epanchin, Totski immediately began to speak of the intolerable\\r\\ntorment of his position. He admitted that he was to blame for all, but\\r\\ncandidly confessed that he could not bring himself to feel any remorse\\r\\nfor his original guilt towards herself, because he was a man of sensual\\r\\npassions which were inborn and ineradicable, and that he had no power\\r\\nover himself in this respect; but that he wished, seriously, to marry\\r\\nat last, and that the whole fate of the most desirable social union\\r\\nwhich he contemplated, was in her hands; in a word, he confided his all\\r\\nto her generosity of heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Epanchin took up his part and spoke in the character of father\\r\\nof a family; he spoke sensibly, and without wasting words over any\\r\\nattempt at sentimentality, he merely recorded his full admission of her\\r\\nright to be the arbiter of Totskiâ\\x80\\x99s destiny at this moment. He then\\r\\npointed out that the fate of his daughter, and very likely of both his\\r\\nother daughters, now hung upon her reply.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Nastasiaâ\\x80\\x99s question as to what they wished her to do, Totski\\r\\nconfessed that he had been so frightened by her, five years ago, that\\r\\nhe could never now be entirely comfortable until she herself married.\\r\\nHe immediately added that such a suggestion from him would, of course,\\r\\nbe absurd, unless accompanied by remarks of a more pointed nature. He\\r\\nvery well knew, he said, that a certain young gentleman of good family,\\r\\nnamely, Gavrila Ardalionovitch Ivolgin, with whom she was acquainted,\\r\\nand whom she received at her house, had long loved her passionately,\\r\\nand would give his life for some response from her. The young fellow\\r\\nhad confessed this love of his to him (Totski) and had also admitted it\\r\\nin the hearing of his benefactor, General Epanchin. Lastly, he could\\r\\nnot help being of opinion that Nastasia must be aware of Ganiaâ\\x80\\x99s love\\r\\nfor her, and if he (Totski) mistook not, she had looked with some\\r\\nfavour upon it, being often lonely, and rather tired of her present\\r\\nlife. Having remarked how difficult it was for him, of all people, to\\r\\nspeak to her of these matters, Totski concluded by saying that he\\r\\ntrusted Nastasia Philipovna would not look with contempt upon him if he\\r\\nnow expressed his sincere desire to guarantee her future by a gift of\\r\\nseventy-five thousand roubles. He added that the sum would have been\\r\\nleft her all the same in his will, and that therefore she must not\\r\\nconsider the gift as in any way an indemnification to her for anything,\\r\\nbut that there was no reason, after all, why a man should not be\\r\\nallowed to entertain a natural desire to lighten his conscience, etc.,\\r\\netc.; in fact, all that would naturally be said under the\\r\\ncircumstances. Totski was very eloquent all through, and, in\\r\\nconclusion, just touched on the fact that not a soul in the world, not\\r\\neven General Epanchin, had ever heard a word about the above\\r\\nseventy-five thousand roubles, and that this was the first time he had\\r\\never given expression to his intentions in respect to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nNastasia Philipovnaâ\\x80\\x99s reply to this long rigmarole astonished both the\\r\\nfriends considerably.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot only was there no trace of her former irony, of her old hatred and\\r\\nenmity, and of that dreadful laughter, the very recollection of which\\r\\nsent a cold chill down Totskiâ\\x80\\x99s back to this very day; but she seemed\\r\\ncharmed and really glad to have the opportunity of talking seriously\\r\\nwith him for once in a way. She confessed that she had long wished to\\r\\nhave a frank and free conversation and to ask for friendly advice, but\\r\\nthat pride had hitherto prevented her; now, however, that the ice was\\r\\nbroken, nothing could be more welcome to her than this opportunity.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, with a sad smile, and then with a twinkle of merriment in her\\r\\neyes, she admitted that such a storm as that of five years ago was now\\r\\nquite out of the question. She said that she had long since changed her\\r\\nviews of things, and recognized that facts must be taken into\\r\\nconsideration in spite of the feelings of the heart. What was done was\\r\\ndone and ended, and she could not understand why Totski should still\\r\\nfeel alarmed.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe next turned to General Epanchin and observed, most courteously,\\r\\nthat she had long since known of his daughters, and that she had heard\\r\\nnone but good report; that she had learned to think of them with deep\\r\\nand sincere respect. The idea alone that she could in any way serve\\r\\nthem, would be to her both a pride and a source of real happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was true that she was lonely in her present life; Totski had judged\\r\\nher thoughts aright. She longed to rise, if not to love, at least to\\r\\nfamily life and new hopes and objects, but as to Gavrila\\r\\nArdalionovitch, she could not as yet say much. She thought it must be\\r\\nthe case that he loved her; she felt that she too might learn to love\\r\\nhim, if she could be sure of the firmness of his attachment to herself;\\r\\nbut he was very young, and it was a difficult question to decide. What\\r\\nshe specially liked about him was that he worked, and supported his\\r\\nfamily by his toil.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had heard that he was proud and ambitious; she had heard much that\\r\\nwas interesting of his mother and sister, she had heard of them from\\r\\nMr. Ptitsin, and would much like to make their acquaintance,\\r\\nbutâ\\x80\\x94another question!â\\x80\\x94would they like to receive her into their house?\\r\\nAt all events, though she did not reject the idea of this marriage, she\\r\\ndesired not to be hurried. As for the seventy-five thousand roubles,\\r\\nMr. Totski need not have found any difficulty or awkwardness about the\\r\\nmatter; she quite understood the value of money, and would, of course,\\r\\naccept the gift. She thanked him for his delicacy, however, but saw no\\r\\nreason why Gavrila Ardalionovitch should not know about it.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe would not marry the latter, she said, until she felt persuaded that\\r\\nneither on his part nor on the part of his family did there exist any\\r\\nsort of concealed suspicions as to herself. She did not intend to ask\\r\\nforgiveness for anything in the past, which fact she desired to be\\r\\nknown. She did not consider herself to blame for anything that had\\r\\nhappened in former years, and she thought that Gavrila Ardalionovitch\\r\\nshould be informed as to the relations which had existed between\\r\\nherself and Totski during the last five years. If she accepted this\\r\\nmoney it was not to be considered as indemnification for her misfortune\\r\\nas a young girl, which had not been in any degree her own fault, but\\r\\nmerely as compensation for her ruined life.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe became so excited and agitated during all these explanations and\\r\\nconfessions that General Epanchin was highly gratified, and considered\\r\\nthe matter satisfactorily arranged once for all. But the once bitten\\r\\nTotski was twice shy, and looked for hidden snakes among the flowers.\\r\\nHowever, the special point to which the two friends particularly\\r\\ntrusted to bring about their object (namely, Ganiaâ\\x80\\x99s attractiveness for\\r\\nNastasia Philipovna), stood out more and more prominently; the\\r\\npourparlers had commenced, and gradually even Totski began to believe\\r\\nin the possibility of success.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore long Nastasia and Gania had talked the matter over. Very little\\r\\nwas saidâ\\x80\\x94her modesty seemed to suffer under the infliction of\\r\\ndiscussing such a question. But she recognized his love, on the\\r\\nunderstanding that she bound herself to nothing whatever, and that she\\r\\nreserved the right to say â\\x80\\x9cnoâ\\x80\\x9d up to the very hour of the marriage\\r\\nceremony. Gania was to have the same right of refusal at the last\\r\\nmoment.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt soon became clear to Gania, after scenes of wrath and quarrellings\\r\\nat the domestic hearth, that his family were seriously opposed to the\\r\\nmatch, and that Nastasia was aware of this fact was equally evident.\\r\\nShe said nothing about it, though he daily expected her to do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were several rumours afloat, before long, which upset Totskiâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nequanimity a good deal, but we will not now stop to describe them;\\r\\nmerely mentioning an instance or two. One was that Nastasia had entered\\r\\ninto close and secret relations with the Epanchin girlsâ\\x80\\x94a most unlikely\\r\\nrumour; another was that Nastasia had long satisfied herself of the\\r\\nfact that Gania was merely marrying her for money, and that his nature\\r\\nwas gloomy and greedy, impatient and selfish, to an extraordinary\\r\\ndegree; and that although he had been keen enough in his desire to\\r\\nachieve a conquest before, yet since the two friends had agreed to\\r\\nexploit his passion for their own purposes, it was clear enough that he\\r\\nhad begun to consider the whole thing a nuisance and a nightmare.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his heart passion and hate seemed to hold divided sway, and although\\r\\nhe had at last given his consent to marry the woman (as he said), under\\r\\nthe stress of circumstances, yet he promised himself that he would\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9ctake it out of her,â\\x80\\x9d after marriage.\\r\\n\\r\\nNastasia seemed to Totski to have divined all this, and to be preparing\\r\\nsomething on her own account, which frightened him to such an extent\\r\\nthat he did not dare communicate his views even to the general. But at\\r\\ntimes he would pluck up his courage and be full of hope and good\\r\\nspirits again, acting, in fact, as weak men do act in such\\r\\ncircumstances.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, both the friends felt that the thing looked rosy indeed when\\r\\none day Nastasia informed them that she would give her final answer on\\r\\nthe evening of her birthday, which anniversary was due in a very short\\r\\ntime.\\r\\n\\r\\nA strange rumour began to circulate, meanwhile; no less than that the\\r\\nrespectable and highly respected General Epanchin was himself so\\r\\nfascinated by Nastasia Philipovna that his feeling for her amounted\\r\\nalmost to passion. What he thought to gain by Ganiaâ\\x80\\x99s marriage to the\\r\\ngirl it was difficult to imagine. Possibly he counted on Ganiaâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ncomplaisance; for Totski had long suspected that there existed some\\r\\nsecret understanding between the general and his secretary. At all\\r\\nevents the fact was known that he had prepared a magnificent present of\\r\\npearls for Nastasiaâ\\x80\\x99s birthday, and that he was looking forward to the\\r\\noccasion when he should present his gift with the greatest excitement\\r\\nand impatience. The day before her birthday he was in a fever of\\r\\nagitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Epanchin, long accustomed to her husbandâ\\x80\\x99s infidelities, had heard\\r\\nof the pearls, and the rumour excited her liveliest curiosity and\\r\\ninterest. The general remarked her suspicions, and felt that a grand\\r\\nexplanation must shortly take placeâ\\x80\\x94which fact alarmed him much.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the reason why he was so unwilling to take lunch (on the\\r\\nmorning upon which we took up this narrative) with the rest of his\\r\\nfamily. Before the princeâ\\x80\\x99s arrival he had made up his mind to plead\\r\\nbusiness, and â\\x80\\x9ccutâ\\x80\\x9d the meal; which simply meant running away.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was particularly anxious that this one day should be\\r\\npassedâ\\x80\\x94especially the eveningâ\\x80\\x94without unpleasantness between himself\\r\\nand his family; and just at the right moment the prince turned upâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cas\\r\\nthough Heaven had sent him on purpose,â\\x80\\x9d said the general to himself, as\\r\\nhe left the study to seek out the wife of his bosom.\\r\\n\\r\\nV.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. General Epanchin was a proud woman by nature. What must her\\r\\nfeelings have been when she heard that Prince Muishkin, the last of his\\r\\nand her line, had arrived in beggarâ\\x80\\x99s guise, a wretched idiot, a\\r\\nrecipient of charityâ\\x80\\x94all of which details the general gave out for\\r\\ngreater effect! He was anxious to steal her interest at the first\\r\\nswoop, so as to distract her thoughts from other matters nearer home.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Epanchin was in the habit of holding herself very straight, and\\r\\nstaring before her, without speaking, in moments of excitement.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was a fine woman of the same age as her husband, with a slightly\\r\\nhooked nose, a high, narrow forehead, thick hair turning a little grey,\\r\\nand a sallow complexion. Her eyes were grey and wore a very curious\\r\\nexpression at times. She believed them to be most effectiveâ\\x80\\x94a belief\\r\\nthat nothing could alter.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat, receive him! Now, at once?â\\x80\\x9d asked Mrs. Epanchin, gazing vaguely\\r\\nat her husband as he stood fidgeting before her.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, dear me, I assure you there is no need to stand on ceremony with\\r\\nhim,â\\x80\\x9d the general explained hastily. â\\x80\\x9cHe is quite a child, not to say a\\r\\npathetic-looking creature. He has fits of some sort, and has just\\r\\narrived from Switzerland, straight from the station, dressed like a\\r\\nGerman and without a farthing in his pocket. I gave him twenty-five\\r\\nroubles to go on with, and am going to find him some easy place in one\\r\\nof the government offices. I should like you to ply him well with the\\r\\nvictuals, my dears, for I should think he must be very hungry.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou astonish me,â\\x80\\x9d said the lady, gazing as before. â\\x80\\x9cFits, and hungry\\r\\ntoo! What sort of fits?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, they donâ\\x80\\x99t come on frequently, besides, heâ\\x80\\x99s a regular child,\\r\\nthough he seems to be fairly educated. I should like you, if possible,\\r\\nmy dears,â\\x80\\x9d the general added, making slowly for the door, â\\x80\\x9cto put him\\r\\nthrough his paces a bit, and see what he is good for. I think you\\r\\nshould be kind to him; it is a good deed, you knowâ\\x80\\x94however, just as you\\r\\nlike, of courseâ\\x80\\x94but he is a sort of relation, remember, and I thought\\r\\nit might interest you to see the young fellow, seeing that this is so.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, of course, mamma, if we neednâ\\x80\\x99t stand on ceremony with him, we\\r\\nmust give the poor fellow something to eat after his journey;\\r\\nespecially as he has not the least idea where to go to,â\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nAlexandra, the eldest of the girls.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBesides, heâ\\x80\\x99s quite a child; we can entertain him with a little\\r\\nhide-and-seek, in case of need,â\\x80\\x9d said Adelaida.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHide-and-seek? What do you mean?â\\x80\\x9d inquired Mrs. Epanchin.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, do stop pretending, mamma,â\\x80\\x9d cried Aglaya, in vexation. â\\x80\\x9cSend him\\r\\nup, father; mother allows.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general rang the bell and gave orders that the prince should be\\r\\nshown in.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOnly on condition that he has a napkin under his chin at lunch, then,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nsaid Mrs. Epanchin, â\\x80\\x9cand let Fedor, or Mavra, stand behind him while he\\r\\neats. Is he quiet when he has these fits? He doesnâ\\x80\\x99t show violence,\\r\\ndoes he?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOn the contrary, he seems to be very well brought up. His manners are\\r\\nexcellentâ\\x80\\x94but here he is himself. Here you are, princeâ\\x80\\x94let me introduce\\r\\nyou, the last of the Muishkins, a relative of your own, my dear, or at\\r\\nleast of the same name. Receive him kindly, please. Theyâ\\x80\\x99ll bring in\\r\\nlunch directly, prince; you must stop and have some, but you must\\r\\nexcuse me. Iâ\\x80\\x99m in a hurry, I must be offâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe all know where _you_ must be off to!â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Epanchin, in a\\r\\nmeaning voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, yesâ\\x80\\x94I must hurry away, Iâ\\x80\\x99m late! Look here, dears, let him write\\r\\nyou something in your albums; youâ\\x80\\x99ve no idea what a wonderful\\r\\ncaligraphist he is, wonderful talent! He has just written out â\\x80\\x98Abbot\\r\\nPafnute signed thisâ\\x80\\x99 for me. Well, _au revoir!_â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cStop a minute; where are you off to? Who is this abbot?â\\x80\\x9d cried Mrs.\\r\\nEpanchin to her retreating husband in a tone of excited annoyance.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, my dear, it was an old abbot of that nameâ\\x80\\x94I must be off to see\\r\\nthe count, heâ\\x80\\x99s waiting for me, Iâ\\x80\\x99m lateâ\\x80\\x94Good-bye! _Au revoir_,\\r\\nprince!â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94and the general bolted at full speed.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, yesâ\\x80\\x94I know what count youâ\\x80\\x99re going to see!â\\x80\\x9d remarked his wife in a\\r\\ncutting manner, as she turned her angry eyes on the prince. â\\x80\\x9cNow then,\\r\\nwhatâ\\x80\\x99s all this about?â\\x80\\x94What abbotâ\\x80\\x94Whoâ\\x80\\x99s Pafnute?â\\x80\\x9d she added, brusquely.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMamma!â\\x80\\x9d said Alexandra, shocked at her rudeness.\\r\\n\\r\\nAglaya stamped her foot.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNonsense! Let me alone!â\\x80\\x9d said the angry mother. â\\x80\\x9cNow then, prince, sit\\r\\ndown here, no, nearer, come nearer the light! I want to have a good\\r\\nlook at you. So, now then, who is this abbot?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAbbot Pafnute,â\\x80\\x9d said our friend, seriously and with deference.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPafnute, yes. And who was he?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Epanchin put these questions hastily and brusquely, and when the\\r\\nprince answered she nodded her head sagely at each word he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Abbot Pafnute lived in the fourteenth century,â\\x80\\x9d began the prince;\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9che was in charge of one of the monasteries on the Volga, about where\\r\\nour present Kostroma government lies. He went to Oreol and helped in\\r\\nthe great matters then going on in the religious world; he signed an\\r\\nedict there, and I have seen a print of his signature; it struck me, so\\r\\nI copied it. When the general asked me, in his study, to write\\r\\nsomething for him, to show my handwriting, I wrote â\\x80\\x98The Abbot Pafnute\\r\\nsigned this,â\\x80\\x99 in the exact handwriting of the abbot. The general liked\\r\\nit very much, and thatâ\\x80\\x99s why he recalled it just now.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAglaya, make a note of â\\x80\\x98Pafnute,â\\x80\\x99 or we shall forget him. Hâ\\x80\\x99m! and\\r\\nwhere is this signature?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think it was left on the generalâ\\x80\\x99s table.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLet it be sent for at once!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll write you a new one in half a minute,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, â\\x80\\x9cif\\r\\nyou like!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course, mamma!â\\x80\\x9d said Alexandra. â\\x80\\x9cBut letâ\\x80\\x99s have lunch now, we are\\r\\nall hungry!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes; come along, prince,â\\x80\\x9d said the mother, â\\x80\\x9care you very hungry?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes; I must say that I am pretty hungry, thanks very much.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHâ\\x80\\x99m! I like to see that you know your manners; and you are by no means\\r\\nsuch a person as the general thought fit to describe you. Come along;\\r\\nyou sit here, opposite to me,â\\x80\\x9d she continued, â\\x80\\x9cI wish to be able to see\\r\\nyour face. Alexandra, Adelaida, look after the prince! He doesnâ\\x80\\x99t seem\\r\\nso very ill, does he? I donâ\\x80\\x99t think he requires a napkin under his\\r\\nchin, after all; are you accustomed to having one on, prince?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFormerly, when I was seven years old or so. I believe I wore one; but\\r\\nnow I usually hold my napkin on my knee when I eat.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course, of course! And about your fits?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFits?â\\x80\\x9d asked the prince, slightly surprised. â\\x80\\x9cI very seldom have fits\\r\\nnowadays. I donâ\\x80\\x99t know how it may be here, though; they say the climate\\r\\nmay be bad for me.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe talks very well, you know!â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Epanchin, who still continued\\r\\nto nod at each word the prince spoke. â\\x80\\x9cI really did not expect it at\\r\\nall; in fact, I suppose it was all stuff and nonsense on the generalâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\npart, as usual. Eat away, prince, and tell me where you were born, and\\r\\nwhere you were brought up. I wish to know all about you, you interest\\r\\nme very much!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince expressed his thanks once more, and eating heartily the\\r\\nwhile, recommenced the narrative of his life in Switzerland, all of\\r\\nwhich we have heard before. Mrs. Epanchin became more and more pleased\\r\\nwith her guest; the girls, too, listened with considerable attention.\\r\\nIn talking over the question of relationship it turned out that the\\r\\nprince was very well up in the matter and knew his pedigree off by\\r\\nheart. It was found that scarcely any connection existed between\\r\\nhimself and Mrs. Epanchin, but the talk, and the opportunity of\\r\\nconversing about her family tree, gratified the latter exceedingly, and\\r\\nshe rose from the table in great good humour.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLetâ\\x80\\x99s all go to my boudoir,â\\x80\\x9d she said, â\\x80\\x9cand they shall bring some\\r\\ncoffee in there. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s the room where we all assemble and busy\\r\\nourselves as we like best,â\\x80\\x9d she explained. â\\x80\\x9cAlexandra, my eldest, here,\\r\\nplays the piano, or reads or sews; Adelaida paints landscapes and\\r\\nportraits (but never finishes any); and Aglaya sits and does nothing. I\\r\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t work too much, either. Here we are, now; sit down, prince, near\\r\\nthe fire and talk to us. I want to hear you relate something. I wish to\\r\\nmake sure of you first and then tell my old friend, Princess\\r\\nBielokonski, about you. I wish you to know all the good people and to\\r\\ninterest them. Now then, begin!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMamma, itâ\\x80\\x99s rather a strange order, that!â\\x80\\x9d said Adelaida, who was\\r\\nfussing among her paints and paint-brushes at the easel. Aglaya and\\r\\nAlexandra had settled themselves with folded hands on a sofa, evidently\\r\\nmeaning to be listeners. The prince felt that the general attention was\\r\\nconcentrated upon himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI should refuse to say a word if _I_ were ordered to tell a story like\\r\\nthat!â\\x80\\x9d observed Aglaya.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy? whatâ\\x80\\x99s there strange about it? He has a tongue. Why shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t he\\r\\ntell us something? I want to judge whether he is a good story-teller;\\r\\nanything you like, princeâ\\x80\\x94how you liked Switzerland, what was your\\r\\nfirst impression, anything. Youâ\\x80\\x99ll see, heâ\\x80\\x99ll begin directly and tell\\r\\nus all about it beautifully.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe impression was forcibleâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d the prince began.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere, you see, girls,â\\x80\\x9d said the impatient lady, â\\x80\\x9che _has_ begun, you\\r\\nsee.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, then, _let_ him talk, mamma,â\\x80\\x9d said Alexandra. â\\x80\\x9cThis prince is a\\r\\ngreat humbug and by no means an idiot,â\\x80\\x9d she whispered to Aglaya.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, I saw that at once,â\\x80\\x9d replied the latter. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t think it at all\\r\\nnice of him to play a part. What does he wish to gain by it, I wonder?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy first impression was a very strong one,â\\x80\\x9d repeated the prince. â\\x80\\x9cWhen\\r\\nthey took me away from Russia, I remember I passed through many German\\r\\ntowns and looked out of the windows, but did not trouble so much as to\\r\\nask questions about them. This was after a long series of fits. I\\r\\nalways used to fall into a sort of torpid condition after such a\\r\\nseries, and lost my memory almost entirely; and though I was not\\r\\naltogether without reason at such times, yet I had no logical power of\\r\\nthought. This would continue for three or four days, and then I would\\r\\nrecover myself again. I remember my melancholy was intolerable; I felt\\r\\ninclined to cry; I sat and wondered and wondered uncomfortably; the\\r\\nconsciousness that everything was strange weighed terribly upon me; I\\r\\ncould understand that it was all foreign and strange. I recollect I\\r\\nawoke from this state for the first time at Basle, one evening; the\\r\\nbray of a donkey aroused me, a donkey in the town market. I saw the\\r\\ndonkey and was extremely pleased with it, and from that moment my head\\r\\nseemed to clear.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA donkey? How strange! Yet it is not strange. Anyone of us might fall\\r\\nin love with a donkey! It happened in mythological times,â\\x80\\x9d said Madame\\r\\nEpanchin, looking wrathfully at her daughters, who had begun to laugh.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGo on, prince.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSince that evening I have been specially fond of donkeys. I began to\\r\\nask questions about them, for I had never seen one before; and I at\\r\\nonce came to the conclusion that this must be one of the most useful of\\r\\nanimalsâ\\x80\\x94strong, willing, patient, cheap; and, thanks to this donkey, I\\r\\nbegan to like the whole country I was travelling through; and my\\r\\nmelancholy passed away.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAll this is very strange and interesting,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Epanchin. â\\x80\\x9cNow\\r\\nletâ\\x80\\x99s leave the donkey and go on to other matters. What are you\\r\\nlaughing at, Aglaya? and you too, Adelaida? The prince told us his\\r\\nexperiences very cleverly; he saw the donkey himself, and what have you\\r\\never seen? _You_ have never been abroad.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have seen a donkey though, mamma!â\\x80\\x9d said Aglaya.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd Iâ\\x80\\x99ve heard one!â\\x80\\x9d said Adelaida. All three of the girls laughed out\\r\\nloud, and the prince laughed with them.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, itâ\\x80\\x99s too bad of you,â\\x80\\x9d said mamma. â\\x80\\x9cYou must forgive them,\\r\\nprince; they are good girls. I am very fond of them, though I often\\r\\nhave to be scolding them; they are all as silly and mad as march\\r\\nhares.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, why shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t they laugh?â\\x80\\x9d said the prince. â\\x80\\x9cI shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have let\\r\\nthe chance go by in their place, I know. But I stick up for the donkey,\\r\\nall the same; heâ\\x80\\x99s a patient, good-natured fellow.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAre you a patient man, prince? I ask out of curiosity,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs.\\r\\nEpanchin.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll laughed again.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, that wretched donkey again, I see!â\\x80\\x9d cried the lady. â\\x80\\x9cI assure you,\\r\\nprince, I was not guilty of the leastâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cInsinuation? Oh! I assure you, I take your word for it.â\\x80\\x9d And the\\r\\nprince continued laughing merrily.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI must say itâ\\x80\\x99s very nice of you to laugh. I see you really are a\\r\\nkind-hearted fellow,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Epanchin.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m not always kind, though.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am kind myself, and _always_ kind too, if you please!â\\x80\\x9d she retorted,\\r\\nunexpectedly; â\\x80\\x9cand that is my chief fault, for one ought not to be\\r\\nalways kind. I am often angry with these girls and their father; but\\r\\nthe worst of it is, I am always kindest when I am cross. I was very\\r\\nangry just before you came, and Aglaya there read me a lessonâ\\x80\\x94thanks,\\r\\nAglaya, dearâ\\x80\\x94come and kiss meâ\\x80\\x94thereâ\\x80\\x94thatâ\\x80\\x99s enoughâ\\x80\\x9d she added, as Aglaya\\r\\ncame forward and kissed her lips and then her hand. â\\x80\\x9cNow then, go on,\\r\\nprince. Perhaps you can think of something more exciting than about the\\r\\ndonkey, eh?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI must say, again, _I_ canâ\\x80\\x99t understand how you can expect anyone to\\r\\ntell you stories straight away, so,â\\x80\\x9d said Adelaida. â\\x80\\x9cI know I never\\r\\ncould!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, but the prince can, because he is cleverâ\\x80\\x94cleverer than you are by\\r\\nten or twenty times, if you like. There, thatâ\\x80\\x99s so, prince; and\\r\\nseriously, letâ\\x80\\x99s drop the donkey nowâ\\x80\\x94what else did you see abroad,\\r\\nbesides the donkey?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, but the prince told us about the donkey very cleverly, all the\\r\\nsame,â\\x80\\x9d said Alexandra. â\\x80\\x9cI have always been most interested to hear how\\r\\npeople go mad and get well again, and that sort of thing. Especially\\r\\nwhen it happens suddenly.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuite so, quite so!â\\x80\\x9d cried Mrs. Epanchin, delighted. â\\x80\\x9cI see you _can_\\r\\nbe sensible now and then, Alexandra. You were speaking of Switzerland,\\r\\nprince?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes. We came to Lucerne, and I was taken out in a boat. I felt how\\r\\nlovely it was, but the loveliness weighed upon me somehow or other, and\\r\\nmade me feel melancholy.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy?â\\x80\\x9d asked Alexandra.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know; I always feel like that when I look at the beauties of\\r\\nnature for the first time; but then, I was ill at that time, of\\r\\ncourse!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, but I should like to see it!â\\x80\\x9d said Adelaida; â\\x80\\x9cand I donâ\\x80\\x99t know\\r\\n_when_ we shall ever go abroad. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been two years looking out for a\\r\\ngood subject for a picture. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve done all I know. â\\x80\\x98The North and South\\r\\nI know by heart,â\\x80\\x99 as our poet observes. Do help me to a subject,\\r\\nprince.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, but I know nothing about painting. It seems to me one only has to\\r\\nlook, and paint what one sees.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut I donâ\\x80\\x99t know _how_ to see!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNonsense, what rubbish you talk!â\\x80\\x9d the mother struck in. â\\x80\\x9cNot know how\\r\\nto see! Open your eyes and look! If you canâ\\x80\\x99t see here, you wonâ\\x80\\x99t see\\r\\nabroad either. Tell us what you saw yourself, prince!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, thatâ\\x80\\x99s better,â\\x80\\x9d said Adelaida; â\\x80\\x9cthe prince _learned to see_\\r\\nabroad.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, I hardly know! You see, I only went to restore my health. I donâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nknow whether I learned to see, exactly. I was very happy, however,\\r\\nnearly all the time.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHappy! you can be happy?â\\x80\\x9d cried Aglaya. â\\x80\\x9cThen how can you say you did\\r\\nnot learn to see? I should think you could teach _us_ to see!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh! _do_ teach us,â\\x80\\x9d laughed Adelaida.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh! I canâ\\x80\\x99t do that,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, laughing too. â\\x80\\x9cI lived almost\\r\\nall the while in one little Swiss village; what can I teach you? At\\r\\nfirst I was only just not absolutely dull; then my health began to\\r\\nimproveâ\\x80\\x94then every day became dearer and more precious to me, and the\\r\\nlonger I stayed, the dearer became the time to me; so much so that I\\r\\ncould not help observing it; but why this was so, it would be difficult\\r\\nto say.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo that you didnâ\\x80\\x99t care to go away anywhere else?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, at first I did; I was restless; I didnâ\\x80\\x99t know however I should\\r\\nmanage to support lifeâ\\x80\\x94you know there are such moments, especially in\\r\\nsolitude. There was a waterfall near us, such a lovely thin streak of\\r\\nwater, like a thread but white and moving. It fell from a great height,\\r\\nbut it looked quite low, and it was half a mile away, though it did not\\r\\nseem fifty paces. I loved to listen to it at night, but it was then\\r\\nthat I became so restless. Sometimes I went and climbed the mountain\\r\\nand stood there in the midst of the tall pines, all alone in the\\r\\nterrible silence, with our little village in the distance, and the sky\\r\\nso blue, and the sun so bright, and an old ruined castle on the\\r\\nmountain-side, far away. I used to watch the line where earth and sky\\r\\nmet, and longed to go and seek there the key of all mysteries, thinking\\r\\nthat I might find there a new life, perhaps some great city where life\\r\\nshould be grander and richerâ\\x80\\x94and then it struck me that life may be\\r\\ngrand enough even in a prison.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI read that last most praiseworthy thought in my manual, when I was\\r\\ntwelve years old,â\\x80\\x9d said Aglaya.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAll this is pure philosophy,â\\x80\\x9d said Adelaida. â\\x80\\x9cYou are a philosopher,\\r\\nprince, and have come here to instruct us in your views.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPerhaps you are right,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, smiling. â\\x80\\x9cI think I am a\\r\\nphilosopher, perhaps, and who knows, perhaps I do wish to teach my\\r\\nviews of things to those I meet with?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYour philosophy is rather like that of an old woman we know, who is\\r\\nrich and yet does nothing but try how little she can spend. She talks\\r\\nof nothing but money all day. Your great philosophical idea of a grand\\r\\nlife in a prison and your four happy years in that Swiss village are\\r\\nlike this, rather,â\\x80\\x9d said Aglaya.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAs to life in a prison, of course there may be two opinions,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\r\\nprince. â\\x80\\x9cI once heard the story of a man who lived twelve years in a\\r\\nprisonâ\\x80\\x94I heard it from the man himself. He was one of the persons under\\r\\ntreatment with my professor; he had fits, and attacks of melancholy,\\r\\nthen he would weep, and once he tried to commit suicide. _His_ life in\\r\\nprison was sad enough; his only acquaintances were spiders and a tree\\r\\nthat grew outside his gratingâ\\x80\\x94but I think I had better tell you of\\r\\nanother man I met last year. There was a very strange feature in this\\r\\ncase, strange because of its extremely rare occurrence. This man had\\r\\nonce been brought to the scaffold in company with several others, and\\r\\nhad had the sentence of death by shooting passed upon him for some\\r\\npolitical crime. Twenty minutes later he had been reprieved and some\\r\\nother punishment substituted; but the interval between the two\\r\\nsentences, twenty minutes, or at least a quarter of an hour, had been\\r\\npassed in the certainty that within a few minutes he must die. I was\\r\\nvery anxious to hear him speak of his impressions during that dreadful\\r\\ntime, and I several times inquired of him as to what he thought and\\r\\nfelt. He remembered everything with the most accurate and extraordinary\\r\\ndistinctness, and declared that he would never forget a single iota of\\r\\nthe experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAbout twenty paces from the scaffold, where he had stood to hear the\\r\\nsentence, were three posts, fixed in the ground, to which to fasten the\\r\\ncriminals (of whom there were several). The first three criminals were\\r\\ntaken to the posts, dressed in long white tunics, with white caps drawn\\r\\nover their faces, so that they could not see the rifles pointed at\\r\\nthem. Then a group of soldiers took their stand opposite to each post.\\r\\nMy friend was the eighth on the list, and therefore he would have been\\r\\namong the third lot to go up. A priest went about among them with a\\r\\ncross: and there was about five minutes of time left for him to live.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe said that those five minutes seemed to him to be a most\\r\\ninterminable period, an enormous wealth of time; he seemed to be\\r\\nliving, in these minutes, so many lives that there was no need as yet\\r\\nto think of that last moment, so that he made several arrangements,\\r\\ndividing up the time into portionsâ\\x80\\x94one for saying farewell to his\\r\\ncompanions, two minutes for that; then a couple more for thinking over\\r\\nhis own life and career and all about himself; and another minute for a\\r\\nlast look around. He remembered having divided his time like this quite\\r\\nwell. While saying good-bye to his friends he recollected asking one of\\r\\nthem some very usual everyday question, and being much interested in\\r\\nthe answer. Then having bade farewell, he embarked upon those two\\r\\nminutes which he had allotted to looking into himself; he knew\\r\\nbeforehand what he was going to think about. He wished to put it to\\r\\nhimself as quickly and clearly as possible, that here was he, a living,\\r\\nthinking man, and that in three minutes he would be nobody; or if\\r\\nsomebody or something, then what and where? He thought he would decide\\r\\nthis question once for all in these last three minutes. A little way\\r\\noff there stood a church, and its gilded spire glittered in the sun. He\\r\\nremembered staring stubbornly at this spire, and at the rays of light\\r\\nsparkling from it. He could not tear his eyes from these rays of light;\\r\\nhe got the idea that these rays were his new nature, and that in three\\r\\nminutes he would become one of them, amalgamated somehow with them.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe repugnance to what must ensue almost immediately, and the\\r\\nuncertainty, were dreadful, he said; but worst of all was the idea,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98What should I do if I were not to die now? What if I were to return to\\r\\nlife again? What an eternity of days, and all mine! How I should grudge\\r\\nand count up every minute of it, so as to waste not a single instant!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nHe said that this thought weighed so upon him and became such a\\r\\nterrible burden upon his brain that he could not bear it, and wished\\r\\nthey would shoot him quickly and have done with it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince paused and all waited, expecting him to go on again and\\r\\nfinish the story.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs that all?â\\x80\\x9d asked Aglaya.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAll? Yes,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, emerging from a momentary reverie.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd why did you tell us this?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, I happened to recall it, thatâ\\x80\\x99s all! It fitted into the\\r\\nconversationâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou probably wish to deduce, prince,â\\x80\\x9d said Alexandra, â\\x80\\x9cthat moments of\\r\\ntime cannot be reckoned by money value, and that sometimes five minutes\\r\\nare worth priceless treasures. All this is very praiseworthy; but may I\\r\\nask about this friend of yours, who told you the terrible experience of\\r\\nhis life? He was reprieved, you say; in other words, they did restore\\r\\nto him that â\\x80\\x98eternity of days.â\\x80\\x99 What did he do with these riches of\\r\\ntime? Did he keep careful account of his minutes?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh no, he didnâ\\x80\\x99t! I asked him myself. He said that he had not lived a\\r\\nbit as he had intended, and had wasted many, and many a minute.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery well, then thereâ\\x80\\x99s an experiment, and the thing is proved; one\\r\\ncannot live and count each moment; say what you like, but one\\r\\n_cannot_.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is true,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, â\\x80\\x9cI have thought so myself. And yet,\\r\\nwhy shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t one do it?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou think, then, that you could live more wisely than other people?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nsaid Aglaya.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have had that idea.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd you have it still?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYesâ\\x80\\x94I have it still,â\\x80\\x9d the prince replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had contemplated Aglaya until now, with a pleasant though rather\\r\\ntimid smile, but as the last words fell from his lips he began to\\r\\nlaugh, and looked at her merrily.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are not very modest!â\\x80\\x9d said she.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut how brave you are!â\\x80\\x9d said he. â\\x80\\x9cYou are laughing, and Iâ\\x80\\x94that manâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ntale impressed me so much, that I dreamt of it afterwards; yes, I\\r\\ndreamt of those five minutes...â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked at his listeners again with that same serious, searching\\r\\nexpression.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are not angry with me?â\\x80\\x9d he asked suddenly, and with a kind of\\r\\nnervous hurry, although he looked them straight in the face.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy should we be angry?â\\x80\\x9d they cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOnly because I seem to be giving you a lecture, all the time!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this they laughed heartily.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPlease donâ\\x80\\x99t be angry with me,â\\x80\\x9d continued the prince. â\\x80\\x9cI know very\\r\\nwell that I have seen less of life than other people, and have less\\r\\nknowledge of it. I must appear to speak strangely sometimes...â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe said the last words nervously.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou say you have been happy, and that proves you have lived, not less,\\r\\nbut more than other people. Why make all these excuses?â\\x80\\x9d interrupted\\r\\nAglaya in a mocking tone of voice. â\\x80\\x9cBesides, you need not mind about\\r\\nlecturing us; you have nothing to boast of. With your quietism, one\\r\\ncould live happily for a hundred years at least. One might show you the\\r\\nexecution of a felon, or show you oneâ\\x80\\x99s little finger. You could draw a\\r\\nmoral from either, and be quite satisfied. That sort of existence is\\r\\neasy enough.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI canâ\\x80\\x99t understand why you always fly into a temper,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs.\\r\\nEpanchin, who had been listening to the conversation and examining the\\r\\nfaces of the speakers in turn. â\\x80\\x9cI do not understand what you mean. What\\r\\nhas your little finger to do with it? The prince talks well, though he\\r\\nis not amusing. He began all right, but now he seems sad.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNever mind, mamma! Prince, I wish you had seen an execution,â\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nAglaya. â\\x80\\x9cI should like to ask you a question about that, if you had.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have seen an execution,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have!â\\x80\\x9d cried Aglaya. â\\x80\\x9cI might have guessed it. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s a fitting\\r\\ncrown to the rest of the story. If you have seen an execution, how can\\r\\nyou say you lived happily all the while?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut is there capital punishment where you were?â\\x80\\x9d asked Adelaida.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI saw it at Lyons. Schneider took us there, and as soon as we arrived\\r\\nwe came in for that.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, and did you like it very much? Was it very edifying and\\r\\ninstructive?â\\x80\\x9d asked Aglaya.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I didnâ\\x80\\x99t like it at all, and was ill after seeing it; but I\\r\\nconfess I stared as though my eyes were fixed to the sight. I could not\\r\\ntear them away.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI, too, should have been unable to tear my eyes away,â\\x80\\x9d said Aglaya.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey do not at all approve of women going to see an execution there.\\r\\nThe women who do go are condemned for it afterwards in the newspapers.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is, by contending that it is not a sight for women they admit\\r\\nthat it is a sight for men. I congratulate them on the deduction. I\\r\\nsuppose you quite agree with them, prince?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTell us about the execution,â\\x80\\x9d put in Adelaida.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI would much rather not, just now,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, a little\\r\\ndisturbed and frowning slightly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou donâ\\x80\\x99t seem to want to tell us,â\\x80\\x9d said Aglaya, with a mocking air.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x94the thing is, I was telling all about the execution a little while\\r\\nago, andâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhom did you tell about it?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe man-servant, while I was waiting to see the general.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOur man-servant?â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed several voices at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, the one who waits in the entrance hall, a greyish, red-faced\\r\\nmanâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe prince is clearly a democrat,â\\x80\\x9d remarked Aglaya.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, if you could tell Aleksey about it, surely you can tell us too.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI do so want to hear about it,â\\x80\\x9d repeated Adelaida.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cJust now, I confess,â\\x80\\x9d began the prince, with more animation, â\\x80\\x9cwhen you\\r\\nasked me for a subject for a picture, I confess I had serious thoughts\\r\\nof giving you one. I thought of asking you to draw the face of a\\r\\ncriminal, one minute before the fall of the guillotine, while the\\r\\nwretched man is still standing on the scaffold, preparatory to placing\\r\\nhis neck on the block.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat, his face? only his face?â\\x80\\x9d asked Adelaida. â\\x80\\x9cThat would be a\\r\\nstrange subject indeed. And what sort of a picture would that make?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, why not?â\\x80\\x9d the prince insisted, with some warmth. â\\x80\\x9cWhen I was in\\r\\nBasle I saw a picture very much in that styleâ\\x80\\x94I should like to tell you\\r\\nabout it; I will some time or other; it struck me very forcibly.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, you shall tell us about the Basle picture another time; now we\\r\\nmust have all about the execution,â\\x80\\x9d said Adelaida. â\\x80\\x9cTell us about that\\r\\nface as it appeared to your imaginationâ\\x80\\x94how should it be drawn?â\\x80\\x94just\\r\\nthe face alone, do you mean?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was just a minute before the execution,â\\x80\\x9d began the prince, readily,\\r\\ncarried away by the recollection and evidently forgetting everything\\r\\nelse in a moment; â\\x80\\x9cjust at the instant when he stepped off the ladder\\r\\non to the scaffold. He happened to look in my direction: I saw his eyes\\r\\nand understood all, at onceâ\\x80\\x94but how am I to describe it? I do so wish\\r\\nyou or somebody else could draw it, you, if possible. I thought at the\\r\\ntime what a picture it would make. You must imagine all that went\\r\\nbefore, of course, allâ\\x80\\x94all. He had lived in the prison for some time\\r\\nand had not expected that the execution would take place for at least a\\r\\nweek yetâ\\x80\\x94he had counted on all the formalities and so on taking time;\\r\\nbut it so happened that his papers had been got ready quickly. At five\\r\\noâ\\x80\\x99clock in the morning he was asleepâ\\x80\\x94it was October, and at five in the\\r\\nmorning it was cold and dark. The governor of the prison comes in on\\r\\ntip-toe and touches the sleeping manâ\\x80\\x99s shoulder gently. He starts up.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98What is it?â\\x80\\x99 he says. â\\x80\\x98The execution is fixed for ten oâ\\x80\\x99clock.â\\x80\\x99 He was\\r\\nonly just awake, and would not believe at first, but began to argue\\r\\nthat his papers would not be out for a week, and so on. When he was\\r\\nwide awake and realized the truth, he became very silent and argued no\\r\\nmoreâ\\x80\\x94so they say; but after a bit he said: â\\x80\\x98It comes very hard on one\\r\\nso suddenlyâ\\x80\\x99 and then he was silent again and said nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe three or four hours went by, of course, in necessary\\r\\npreparationsâ\\x80\\x94the priest, breakfast, (coffee, meat, and some wine they\\r\\ngave him; doesnâ\\x80\\x99t it seem ridiculous?) And yet I believe these people\\r\\ngive them a good breakfast out of pure kindness of heart, and believe\\r\\nthat they are doing a good action. Then he is dressed, and then begins\\r\\nthe procession through the town to the scaffold. I think he, too, must\\r\\nfeel that he has an age to live still while they cart him along.\\r\\nProbably he thought, on the way, â\\x80\\x98Oh, I have a long, long time yet.\\r\\nThree streets of life yet! When weâ\\x80\\x99ve passed this street thereâ\\x80\\x99ll be\\r\\nthat other one; and then that one where the bakerâ\\x80\\x99s shop is on the\\r\\nright; and when shall we get there? Itâ\\x80\\x99s ages, ages!â\\x80\\x99 Around him are\\r\\ncrowds shouting, yellingâ\\x80\\x94ten thousand faces, twenty thousand eyes. All\\r\\nthis has to be endured, and especially the thought: â\\x80\\x98Here are ten\\r\\nthousand men, and not one of them is going to be executed, and yet I am\\r\\nto die.â\\x80\\x99 Well, all that is preparatory.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAt the scaffold there is a ladder, and just there he burst into\\r\\ntearsâ\\x80\\x94and this was a strong man, and a terribly wicked one, they say!\\r\\nThere was a priest with him the whole time, talking; even in the cart\\r\\nas they drove along, he talked and talked. Probably the other heard\\r\\nnothing; he would begin to listen now and then, and at the third word\\r\\nor so he had forgotten all about it.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAt last he began to mount the steps; his legs were tied, so that he\\r\\nhad to take very small steps. The priest, who seemed to be a wise man,\\r\\nhad stopped talking now, and only held the cross for the wretched\\r\\nfellow to kiss. At the foot of the ladder he had been pale enough; but\\r\\nwhen he set foot on the scaffold at the top, his face suddenly became\\r\\nthe colour of paper, positively like white notepaper. His legs must\\r\\nhave become suddenly feeble and helpless, and he felt a choking in his\\r\\nthroatâ\\x80\\x94you know the sudden feeling one has in moments of terrible fear,\\r\\nwhen one does not lose oneâ\\x80\\x99s wits, but is absolutely powerless to move?\\r\\nIf some dreadful thing were suddenly to happen; if a house were just\\r\\nabout to fall on one;â\\x80\\x94donâ\\x80\\x99t you know how one would long to sit down and\\r\\nshut oneâ\\x80\\x99s eyes and wait, and wait? Well, when this terrible feeling\\r\\ncame over him, the priest quickly pressed the cross to his lips,\\r\\nwithout a wordâ\\x80\\x94a little silver cross it wasâ\\x80\\x94and he kept on pressing it\\r\\nto the manâ\\x80\\x99s lips every second. And whenever the cross touched his\\r\\nlips, the eyes would open for a moment, and the legs moved once, and he\\r\\nkissed the cross greedily, hurriedlyâ\\x80\\x94just as though he were anxious to\\r\\ncatch hold of something in case of its being useful to him afterwards,\\r\\nthough he could hardly have had any connected religious thoughts at the\\r\\ntime. And so up to the very block.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow strange that criminals seldom swoon at such a moment! On the\\r\\ncontrary, the brain is especially active, and works\\r\\nincessantlyâ\\x80\\x94probably hard, hard, hardâ\\x80\\x94like an engine at full pressure.\\r\\nI imagine that various thoughts must beat loud and fast through his\\r\\nheadâ\\x80\\x94all unfinished ones, and strange, funny thoughts, very\\r\\nlikely!â\\x80\\x94like this, for instance: â\\x80\\x98That man is looking at me, and he has\\r\\na wart on his forehead! and the executioner has burst one of his\\r\\nbuttons, and the lowest one is all rusty!â\\x80\\x99 And meanwhile he notices and\\r\\nremembers everything. There is one point that cannot be forgotten,\\r\\nround which everything else dances and turns about; and because of this\\r\\npoint he cannot faint, and this lasts until the very final quarter of a\\r\\nsecond, when the wretched neck is on the block and the victim listens\\r\\nand waits and _knows_â\\x80\\x94thatâ\\x80\\x99s the point, he _knows_ that he is just\\r\\n_now_ about to die, and listens for the rasp of the iron over his head.\\r\\nIf I lay there, I should certainly listen for that grating sound, and\\r\\nhear it, too! There would probably be but the tenth part of an instant\\r\\nleft to hear it in, but one would certainly hear it. And imagine, some\\r\\npeople declare that when the head flies off it is _conscious_ of having\\r\\nflown off! Just imagine what a thing to realize! Fancy if consciousness\\r\\nwere to last for even five seconds!\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDraw the scaffold so that only the top step of the ladder comes in\\r\\nclearly. The criminal must be just stepping on to it, his face as white\\r\\nas note-paper. The priest is holding the cross to his blue lips, and\\r\\nthe criminal kisses it, and knows and sees and understands everything.\\r\\nThe cross and the headâ\\x80\\x94thereâ\\x80\\x99s your picture; the priest and the\\r\\nexecutioner, with his two assistants, and a few heads and eyes below.\\r\\nThose might come in as subordinate accessoriesâ\\x80\\x94a sort of mist. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\na picture for you.â\\x80\\x9d The prince paused, and looked around.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly that isnâ\\x80\\x99t much like quietism,â\\x80\\x9d murmured Alexandra, half to\\r\\nherself.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow tell us about your love affairs,â\\x80\\x9d said Adelaida, after a momentâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\npause.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince gazed at her in amazement.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou know,â\\x80\\x9d Adelaida continued, â\\x80\\x9cyou owe us a description of the Basle\\r\\npicture; but first I wish to hear how you fell in love. Donâ\\x80\\x99t deny the\\r\\nfact, for you did, of course. Besides, you stop philosophizing when you\\r\\nare telling about anything.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy are you ashamed of your stories the moment after you have told\\r\\nthem?â\\x80\\x9d asked Aglaya, suddenly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow silly you are!â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Epanchin, looking indignantly towards\\r\\nthe last speaker.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, that wasnâ\\x80\\x99t a clever remark,â\\x80\\x9d said Alexandra.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t listen to her, prince,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Epanchin; â\\x80\\x9cshe says that sort\\r\\nof thing out of mischief. Donâ\\x80\\x99t think anything of their nonsense, it\\r\\nmeans nothing. They love to chaff, but they like you. I can see it in\\r\\ntheir facesâ\\x80\\x94I know their faces.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know their faces, too,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, with a peculiar stress on\\r\\nthe words.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow so?â\\x80\\x9d asked Adelaida, with curiosity.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat do _you_ know about our faces?â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed the other two, in\\r\\nchorus.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the prince was silent and serious. All awaited his reply.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you afterwards,â\\x80\\x9d he said quietly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, you want to arouse our curiosity!â\\x80\\x9d said Aglaya. â\\x80\\x9cAnd how terribly\\r\\nsolemn you are about it!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery well,â\\x80\\x9d interrupted Adelaida, â\\x80\\x9cthen if you can read faces so well,\\r\\nyou _must_ have been in love. Come now; Iâ\\x80\\x99ve guessedâ\\x80\\x94letâ\\x80\\x99s have the\\r\\nsecret!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have not been in love,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, as quietly and seriously as\\r\\nbefore. â\\x80\\x9cI have been happy in another way.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow, how?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, apparently in a deep reverie.\\r\\n\\r\\nVI.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHere you all are,â\\x80\\x9d began the prince, â\\x80\\x9csettling yourselves down to\\r\\nlisten to me with so much curiosity, that if I do not satisfy you you\\r\\nwill probably be angry with me. No, no! Iâ\\x80\\x99m only joking!â\\x80\\x9d he added,\\r\\nhastily, with a smile.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, thenâ\\x80\\x94they were all children there, and I was always among\\r\\nchildren and only with children. They were the children of the village\\r\\nin which I lived, and they went to the school thereâ\\x80\\x94all of them. I did\\r\\nnot teach them, oh no; there was a master for that, one Jules Thibaut.\\r\\nI may have taught them some things, but I was among them just as an\\r\\noutsider, and I passed all four years of my life there among them. I\\r\\nwished for nothing better; I used to tell them everything and hid\\r\\nnothing from them. Their fathers and relations were very angry with me,\\r\\nbecause the children could do nothing without me at last, and used to\\r\\nthrong after me at all times. The schoolmaster was my greatest enemy in\\r\\nthe end! I had many enemies, and all because of the children. Even\\r\\nSchneider reproached me. What were they afraid of? One can tell a child\\r\\neverything, anything. I have often been struck by the fact that parents\\r\\nknow their children so little. They should not conceal so much from\\r\\nthem. How well even little children understand that their parents\\r\\nconceal things from them, because they consider them too young to\\r\\nunderstand! Children are capable of giving advice in the most important\\r\\nmatters. How can one deceive these dear little birds, when they look at\\r\\none so sweetly and confidingly? I call them birds because there is\\r\\nnothing in the world better than birds!\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHowever, most of the people were angry with me about one and the same\\r\\nthing; but Thibaut simply was jealous of me. At first he had wagged his\\r\\nhead and wondered how it was that the children understood what I told\\r\\nthem so well, and could not learn from him; and he laughed like\\r\\nanything when I replied that neither he nor I could teach them very\\r\\nmuch, but that _they_ might teach us a good deal.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow he could hate me and tell scandalous stories about me, living\\r\\namong children as he did, is what I cannot understand. Children soothe\\r\\nand heal the wounded heart. I remember there was one poor fellow at our\\r\\nprofessorâ\\x80\\x99s who was being treated for madness, and you have no idea\\r\\nwhat those children did for him, eventually. I donâ\\x80\\x99t think he was mad,\\r\\nbut only terribly unhappy. But Iâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you all about him another day.\\r\\nNow I must get on with this story.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe children did not love me at first; I was such a sickly, awkward\\r\\nkind of a fellow thenâ\\x80\\x94and I know I am ugly. Besides, I was a foreigner.\\r\\nThe children used to laugh at me, at first; and they even went so far\\r\\nas to throw stones at me, when they saw me kiss Marie. I only kissed\\r\\nher once in my lifeâ\\x80\\x94no, no, donâ\\x80\\x99t laugh!â\\x80\\x9d The prince hastened to\\r\\nsuppress the smiles of his audience at this point. â\\x80\\x9cIt was not a matter\\r\\nof _love_ at all! If only you knew what a miserable creature she was,\\r\\nyou would have pitied her, just as I did. She belonged to our village.\\r\\nHer mother was an old, old woman, and they used to sell string and\\r\\nthread, and soap and tobacco, out of the window of their little house,\\r\\nand lived on the pittance they gained by this trade. The old woman was\\r\\nill and very old, and could hardly move. Marie was her daughter, a girl\\r\\nof twenty, weak and thin and consumptive; but still she did heavy work\\r\\nat the houses around, day by day. Well, one fine day a commercial\\r\\ntraveller betrayed her and carried her off; and a week later he\\r\\ndeserted her. She came home dirty, draggled, and shoeless; she had\\r\\nwalked for a whole week without shoes; she had slept in the fields, and\\r\\ncaught a terrible cold; her feet were swollen and sore, and her hands\\r\\ntorn and scratched all over. She never had been pretty even before; but\\r\\nher eyes were quiet, innocent, kind eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe was very quiet alwaysâ\\x80\\x94and I remember once, when she had suddenly\\r\\nbegun singing at her work, everyone said, â\\x80\\x98Marie tried to sing today!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nand she got so chaffed that she was silent for ever after. She had been\\r\\ntreated kindly in the place before; but when she came back nowâ\\x80\\x94ill and\\r\\nshunned and miserableâ\\x80\\x94not one of them all had the slightest sympathy\\r\\nfor her. Cruel people! Oh, what hazy understandings they have on such\\r\\nmatters! Her mother was the first to show the way. She received her\\r\\nwrathfully, unkindly, and with contempt. â\\x80\\x98You have disgraced me,â\\x80\\x99 she\\r\\nsaid. She was the first to cast her into ignominy; but when they all\\r\\nheard that Marie had returned to the village, they ran out to see her\\r\\nand crowded into the little cottageâ\\x80\\x94old men, children, women,\\r\\ngirlsâ\\x80\\x94such a hurrying, stamping, greedy crowd. Marie was lying on the\\r\\nfloor at the old womanâ\\x80\\x99s feet, hungry, torn, draggled, crying,\\r\\nmiserable.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen everyone crowded into the room she hid her face in her\\r\\ndishevelled hair and lay cowering on the floor. Everyone looked at her\\r\\nas though she were a piece of dirt off the road. The old men scolded\\r\\nand condemned, and the young ones laughed at her. The women condemned\\r\\nher too, and looked at her contemptuously, just as though she were some\\r\\nloathsome insect.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHer mother allowed all this to go on, and nodded her head and\\r\\nencouraged them. The old woman was very ill at that time, and knew she\\r\\nwas dying (she really did die a couple of months later), and though she\\r\\nfelt the end approaching she never thought of forgiving her daughter,\\r\\nto the very day of her death. She would not even speak to her. She made\\r\\nher sleep on straw in a shed, and hardly gave her food enough to\\r\\nsupport life.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMarie was very gentle to her mother, and nursed her, and did\\r\\neverything for her; but the old woman accepted all her services without\\r\\na word and never showed her the slightest kindness. Marie bore all\\r\\nthis; and I could see when I got to know her that she thought it quite\\r\\nright and fitting, considering herself the lowest and meanest of\\r\\ncreatures.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen the old woman took to her bed finally, the other old women in the\\r\\nvillage sat with her by turns, as the custom is there; and then Marie\\r\\nwas quite driven out of the house. They gave her no food at all, and\\r\\nshe could not get any work in the village; none would employ her. The\\r\\nmen seemed to consider her no longer a woman, they said such dreadful\\r\\nthings to her. Sometimes on Sundays, if they were drunk enough, they\\r\\nused to throw her a penny or two, into the mud, and Marie would\\r\\nsilently pick up the money. She had began to spit blood at that time.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAt last her rags became so tattered and torn that she was ashamed of\\r\\nappearing in the village any longer. The children used to pelt her with\\r\\nmud; so she begged to be taken on as assistant cowherd, but the cowherd\\r\\nwould not have her. Then she took to helping him without leave; and he\\r\\nsaw how valuable her assistance was to him, and did not drive her away\\r\\nagain; on the contrary, he occasionally gave her the remnants of his\\r\\ndinner, bread and cheese. He considered that he was being very kind.\\r\\nWhen the mother died, the village parson was not ashamed to hold Marie\\r\\nup to public derision and shame. Marie was standing at the coffinâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nhead, in all her rags, crying.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA crowd of people had collected to see how she would cry. The parson,\\r\\na young fellow ambitious of becoming a great preacher, began his sermon\\r\\nand pointed to Marie. â\\x80\\x98There,â\\x80\\x99 he said, â\\x80\\x98there is the cause of the\\r\\ndeath of this venerable womanâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x94(which was a lie, because she had been\\r\\nill for at least two years)â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98there she stands before you, and dares not\\r\\nlift her eyes from the ground, because she knows that the finger of God\\r\\nis upon her. Look at her tatters and ragsâ\\x80\\x94the badge of those who lose\\r\\ntheir virtue. Who is she? her daughter!â\\x80\\x99 and so on to the end.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd just fancy, this infamy pleased them, all of them, nearly. Only\\r\\nthe children had alteredâ\\x80\\x94for then they were all on my side and had\\r\\nlearned to love Marie.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis is how it was: I had wished to do something for Marie; I longed\\r\\nto give her some money, but I never had a farthing while I was there.\\r\\nBut I had a little diamond pin, and this I sold to a travelling pedlar;\\r\\nhe gave me eight francs for itâ\\x80\\x94it was worth at least forty.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI long sought to meet Marie alone; and at last I did meet her, on the\\r\\nhillside beyond the village. I gave her the eight francs and asked her\\r\\nto take care of the money because I could get no more; and then I\\r\\nkissed her and said that she was not to suppose I kissed her with any\\r\\nevil motives or because I was in love with her, for that I did so\\r\\nsolely out of pity for her, and because from the first I had not\\r\\naccounted her as guilty so much as unfortunate. I longed to console and\\r\\nencourage her somehow, and to assure her that she was not the low, base\\r\\nthing which she and others strove to make out; but I donâ\\x80\\x99t think she\\r\\nunderstood me. She stood before me, dreadfully ashamed of herself, and\\r\\nwith downcast eyes; and when I had finished she kissed my hand. I would\\r\\nhave kissed hers, but she drew it away. Just at this moment the whole\\r\\ntroop of children saw us. (I found out afterwards that they had long\\r\\nkept a watch upon me.) They all began whistling and clapping their\\r\\nhands, and laughing at us. Marie ran away at once; and when I tried to\\r\\ntalk to them, they threw stones at me. All the village heard of it the\\r\\nsame day, and Marieâ\\x80\\x99s position became worse than ever. The children\\r\\nwould not let her pass now in the streets, but annoyed her and threw\\r\\ndirt at her more than before. They used to run after herâ\\x80\\x94she racing\\r\\naway with her poor feeble lungs panting and gasping, and they pelting\\r\\nher and shouting abuse at her.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOnce I had to interfere by force; and after that I took to speaking to\\r\\nthem every day and whenever I could. Occasionally they stopped and\\r\\nlistened; but they teased Marie all the same.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI told them how unhappy Marie was, and after a while they stopped\\r\\ntheir abuse of her, and let her go by silently. Little by little we got\\r\\ninto the way of conversing together, the children and I. I concealed\\r\\nnothing from them, I told them all. They listened very attentively and\\r\\nsoon began to be sorry for Marie. At last some of them took to saying\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Good-morningâ\\x80\\x99 to her, kindly, when they met her. It is the custom\\r\\nthere to salute anyone you meet with â\\x80\\x98Good-morningâ\\x80\\x99 whether acquainted\\r\\nor not. I can imagine how astonished Marie was at these first greetings\\r\\nfrom the children.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOnce two little girls got hold of some food and took it to her, and\\r\\ncame back and told me. They said she had burst into tears, and that\\r\\nthey loved her very much now. Very soon after that they all became fond\\r\\nof Marie, and at the same time they began to develop the greatest\\r\\naffection for myself. They often came to me and begged me to tell them\\r\\nstories. I think I must have told stories well, for they did so love to\\r\\nhear them. At last I took to reading up interesting things on purpose\\r\\nto pass them on to the little ones, and this went on for all the rest\\r\\nof my time there, three years. Later, when everyoneâ\\x80\\x94even Schneiderâ\\x80\\x94was\\r\\nangry with me for hiding nothing from the children, I pointed out how\\r\\nfoolish it was, for they always knew things, only they learnt them in a\\r\\nway that soiled their minds but not so from me. One has only to\\r\\nremember oneâ\\x80\\x99s own childhood to admit the truth of this. But nobody was\\r\\nconvinced... It was two weeks before her mother died that I had kissed\\r\\nMarie; and when the clergyman preached that sermon the children were\\r\\nall on my side.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen I told them what a shame it was of the parson to talk as he had\\r\\ndone, and explained my reason, they were so angry that some of them\\r\\nwent and broke his windows with stones. Of course I stopped them, for\\r\\nthat was not right, but all the village heard of it, and how I caught\\r\\nit for spoiling the children! Everyone discovered now that the little\\r\\nones had taken to being fond of Marie, and their parents were terribly\\r\\nalarmed; but Marie was so happy. The children were forbidden to meet\\r\\nher; but they used to run out of the village to the herd and take her\\r\\nfood and things; and sometimes just ran off there and kissed her, and\\r\\nsaid, â\\x80\\x98_Je vous aime, Marie!_â\\x80\\x99 and then trotted back again. They\\r\\nimagined that I was in love with Marie, and this was the only point on\\r\\nwhich I did not undeceive them, for they got such enjoyment out of it.\\r\\nAnd what delicacy and tenderness they showed!\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn the evening I used to walk to the waterfall. There was a spot there\\r\\nwhich was quite closed in and hidden from view by large trees; and to\\r\\nthis spot the children used to come to me. They could not bear that\\r\\ntheir dear Leon should love a poor girl without shoes to her feet and\\r\\ndressed all in rags and tatters. So, would you believe it, they\\r\\nactually clubbed together, somehow, and bought her shoes and stockings,\\r\\nand some linen, and even a dress! I canâ\\x80\\x99t understand how they managed\\r\\nit, but they did it, all together. When I asked them about it they only\\r\\nlaughed and shouted, and the little girls clapped their hands and\\r\\nkissed me. I sometimes went to see Marie secretly, too. She had become\\r\\nvery ill, and could hardly walk. She still went with the herd, but\\r\\ncould not help the herdsman any longer. She used to sit on a stone\\r\\nnear, and wait there almost motionless all day, till the herd went\\r\\nhome. Her consumption was so advanced, and she was so weak, that she\\r\\nused to sit with closed eyes, breathing heavily. Her face was as thin\\r\\nas a skeletonâ\\x80\\x99s, and sweat used to stand on her white brow in large\\r\\ndrops. I always found her sitting just like that. I used to come up\\r\\nquietly to look at her; but Marie would hear me, open her eyes, and\\r\\ntremble violently as she kissed my hands. I did not take my hand away\\r\\nbecause it made her happy to have it, and so she would sit and cry\\r\\nquietly. Sometimes she tried to speak; but it was very difficult to\\r\\nunderstand her. She was almost like a madwoman, with excitement and\\r\\necstasy, whenever I came. Occasionally the children came with me; when\\r\\nthey did so, they would stand some way off and keep guard over us, so\\r\\nas to tell me if anybody came near. This was a great pleasure to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen we left her, Marie used to relapse at once into her old\\r\\ncondition, and sit with closed eyes and motionless limbs. One day she\\r\\ncould not go out at all, and remained at home all alone in the empty\\r\\nhut; but the children very soon became aware of the fact, and nearly\\r\\nall of them visited her that day as she lay alone and helpless in her\\r\\nmiserable bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFor two days the children looked after her, and then, when the village\\r\\npeople got to know that Marie was really dying, some of the old women\\r\\ncame and took it in turns to sit by her and look after her a bit. I\\r\\nthink they began to be a little sorry for her in the village at last;\\r\\nat all events they did not interfere with the children any more, on her\\r\\naccount.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMarie lay in a state of uncomfortable delirium the whole while; she\\r\\ncoughed dreadfully. The old women would not let the children stay in\\r\\nthe room; but they all collected outside the window each morning, if\\r\\nonly for a moment, and shouted â\\x80\\x98_Bon jour, notre bonne Marie!_â\\x80\\x99 and\\r\\nMarie no sooner caught sight of, or heard them, and she became quite\\r\\nanimated at once, and, in spite of the old women, would try to sit up\\r\\nand nod her head and smile at them, and thank them. The little ones\\r\\nused to bring her nice things and sweets to eat, but she could hardly\\r\\ntouch anything. Thanks to them, I assure you, the girl died almost\\r\\nperfectly happy. She almost forgot her misery, and seemed to accept\\r\\ntheir love as a sort of symbol of pardon for her offence, though she\\r\\nnever ceased to consider herself a dreadful sinner. They used to\\r\\nflutter at her window just like little birds, calling out: â\\x80\\x98_Nous\\r\\ntâ\\x80\\x99aimons, Marie!_â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe died very soon; I had thought she would live much longer. The day\\r\\nbefore her death I went to see her for the last time, just before\\r\\nsunset. I think she recognized me, for she pressed my hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNext morning they came and told me that Marie was dead. The children\\r\\ncould not be restrained now; they went and covered her coffin with\\r\\nflowers, and put a wreath of lovely blossoms on her head. The pastor\\r\\ndid not throw any more shameful words at the poor dead woman; but there\\r\\nwere very few people at the funeral. However, when it came to carrying\\r\\nthe coffin, all the children rushed up, to carry it themselves. Of\\r\\ncourse they could not do it alone, but they insisted on helping, and\\r\\nwalked alongside and behind, crying.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey have planted roses all round her grave, and every year they look\\r\\nafter the flowers and make Marieâ\\x80\\x99s resting-place as beautiful as they\\r\\ncan. I was in ill odour after all this with the parents of the\\r\\nchildren, and especially with the parson and schoolmaster. Schneider\\r\\nwas obliged to promise that I should not meet them and talk to them;\\r\\nbut we conversed from a distance by signs, and they used to write me\\r\\nsweet little notes. Afterwards I came closer than ever to those little\\r\\nsouls, but even then it was very dear to me, to have them so fond of\\r\\nme.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSchneider said that I did the children great harm by my pernicious\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98systemâ\\x80\\x99; what nonsense that was! And what did he mean by my system? He\\r\\nsaid afterwards that he believed I was a child myselfâ\\x80\\x94just before I\\r\\ncame away. â\\x80\\x98You have the form and face of an adultâ\\x80\\x99 he said, â\\x80\\x98but as\\r\\nregards soul, and character, and perhaps even intelligence, you are a\\r\\nchild in the completest sense of the word, and always will be, if you\\r\\nlive to be sixty.â\\x80\\x99 I laughed very much, for of course that is nonsense.\\r\\nBut it is a fact that I do not care to be among grown-up people and\\r\\nmuch prefer the society of children. However kind people may be to me,\\r\\nI never feel quite at home with them, and am always glad to get back to\\r\\nmy little companions. Now my companions have always been children, not\\r\\nbecause I was a child myself once, but because young things attract me.\\r\\nOn one of the first days of my stay in Switzerland, I was strolling\\r\\nabout alone and miserable, when I came upon the children rushing\\r\\nnoisily out of school, with their slates and bags, and books, their\\r\\ngames, their laughter and shoutsâ\\x80\\x94and my soul went out to them. I\\r\\nstopped and laughed happily as I watched their little feet moving so\\r\\nquickly. Girls and boys, laughing and crying; for as they went home\\r\\nmany of them found time to fight and make peace, to weep and play. I\\r\\nforgot my troubles in looking at them. And then, all those three years,\\r\\nI tried to understand why men should be for ever tormenting themselves.\\r\\nI lived the life of a child there, and thought I should never leave the\\r\\nlittle village; indeed, I was far from thinking that I should ever\\r\\nreturn to Russia. But at last I recognized the fact that Schneider\\r\\ncould not keep me any longer. And then something so important happened,\\r\\nthat Schneider himself urged me to depart. I am going to see now if can\\r\\nget good advice about it. Perhaps my lot in life will be changed; but\\r\\nthat is not the principal thing. The principal thing is the entire\\r\\nchange that has already come over me. I left many things behind meâ\\x80\\x94too\\r\\nmany. They have gone. On the journey I said to myself, â\\x80\\x98I am going into\\r\\nthe world of men. I donâ\\x80\\x99t know much, perhaps, but a new life has begun\\r\\nfor me.â\\x80\\x99 I made up my mind to be honest, and steadfast in accomplishing\\r\\nmy task. Perhaps I shall meet with troubles and many disappointments,\\r\\nbut I have made up my mind to be polite and sincere to everyone; more\\r\\ncannot be asked of me. People may consider me a child if they like. I\\r\\nam often called an idiot, and at one time I certainly was so ill that I\\r\\nwas nearly as bad as an idiot; but I am not an idiot now. How can I\\r\\npossibly be so when I know myself that I am considered one?\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen I received a letter from those dear little souls, while passing\\r\\nthrough Berlin, I only then realized how much I loved them. It was\\r\\nvery, very painful, getting that first little letter. How melancholy\\r\\nthey had been when they saw me off! For a month before, they had been\\r\\ntalking of my departure and sorrowing over it; and at the waterfall, of\\r\\nan evening, when we parted for the night, they would hug me so tight\\r\\nand kiss me so warmly, far more so than before. And every now and then\\r\\nthey would turn up one by one when I was alone, just to give me a kiss\\r\\nand a hug, to show their love for me. The whole flock went with me to\\r\\nthe station, which was about a mile from the village, and every now and\\r\\nthen one of them would stop to throw his arms round me, and all the\\r\\nlittle girls had tears in their voices, though they tried hard not to\\r\\ncry. As the train steamed out of the station, I saw them all standing\\r\\non the platform waving to me and crying â\\x80\\x98Hurrah!â\\x80\\x99 till they were lost\\r\\nin the distance.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI assure you, when I came in here just now and saw your kind faces (I\\r\\ncan read faces well) my heart felt light for the first time since that\\r\\nmoment of parting. I think I must be one of those who are born to be in\\r\\nluck, for one does not often meet with people whom one feels he can\\r\\nlove from the first sight of their faces; and yet, no sooner do I step\\r\\nout of the railway carriage than I happen upon you!\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know it is more or less a shamefaced thing to speak of oneâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nfeelings before others; and yet here am I talking like this to you, and\\r\\nam not a bit ashamed or shy. I am an unsociable sort of fellow and\\r\\nshall very likely not come to see you again for some time; but donâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nthink the worse of me for that. It is not that I do not value your\\r\\nsociety; and you must never suppose that I have taken offence at\\r\\nanything.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou asked me about your faces, and what I could read in them; I will\\r\\ntell you with the greatest pleasure. You, Adelaida Ivanovna, have a\\r\\nvery happy face; it is the most sympathetic of the three. Not to speak\\r\\nof your natural beauty, one can look at your face and say to oneâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nself, â\\x80\\x98She has the face of a kind sister.â\\x80\\x99 You are simple and merry,\\r\\nbut you can see into anotherâ\\x80\\x99s heart very quickly. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s what I read\\r\\nin your face.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou too, Alexandra Ivanovna, have a very lovely face; but I think you\\r\\nmay have some secret sorrow. Your heart is undoubtedly a kind, good\\r\\none, but you are not merry. There is a certain suspicion of â\\x80\\x98shadowâ\\x80\\x99 in\\r\\nyour face, like in that of Holbeinâ\\x80\\x99s Madonna in Dresden. So much for\\r\\nyour face. Have I guessed right?\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAs for your face, Lizabetha Prokofievna, I not only think, but am\\r\\nperfectly _sure_, that you are an absolute childâ\\x80\\x94in all, in all, mind,\\r\\nboth good and badâ\\x80\\x94and in spite of your years. Donâ\\x80\\x99t be angry with me\\r\\nfor saying so; you know what my feelings for children are. And do not\\r\\nsuppose that I am so candid out of pure simplicity of soul. Oh dear no,\\r\\nit is by no means the case! Perhaps I have my own very profound object\\r\\nin view.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nVII.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the prince ceased speaking all were gazing merrily at himâ\\x80\\x94even\\r\\nAglaya; but Lizabetha Prokofievna looked the jolliest of all.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell!â\\x80\\x9d she cried, â\\x80\\x9cwe _have_ â\\x80\\x98put him through his paces,â\\x80\\x99 with a\\r\\nvengeance! My dears, you imagined, I believe, that you were about to\\r\\npatronize this young gentleman, like some poor _protÃ©gÃ©_ picked up\\r\\nsomewhere, and taken under your magnificent protection. What fools we\\r\\nwere, and what a specially big fool is your father! Well done, prince!\\r\\nI assure you the general actually asked me to put you through your\\r\\npaces, and examine you. As to what you said about my face, you are\\r\\nabsolutely correct in your judgment. I am a child, and know it. I knew\\r\\nit long before you said so; you have expressed my own thoughts. I think\\r\\nyour nature and mine must be extremely alike, and I am very glad of it.\\r\\nWe are like two drops of water, only you are a man and I a woman, and\\r\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ve not been to Switzerland, and that is all the difference between\\r\\nus.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t be in a hurry, mother; the prince says that he has some motive\\r\\nbehind his simplicity,â\\x80\\x9d cried Aglaya.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, yes, so he does,â\\x80\\x9d laughed the others.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, donâ\\x80\\x99t you begin bantering him,â\\x80\\x9d said mamma. â\\x80\\x9cHe is probably a good\\r\\ndeal cleverer than all three of you girls put together. We shall see.\\r\\nOnly you havenâ\\x80\\x99t told us anything about Aglaya yet, prince; and Aglaya\\r\\nand I are both waiting to hear.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI cannot say anything at present. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you afterwards.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy? Her face is clear enough, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh yes, of course. You are very beautiful, Aglaya Ivanovna, so\\r\\nbeautiful that one is afraid to look at you.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs that all? What about her character?â\\x80\\x9d persisted Mrs. Epanchin.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is difficult to judge when such beauty is concerned. I have not\\r\\nprepared my judgment. Beauty is a riddle.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat means that you have set Aglaya a riddle!â\\x80\\x9d said Adelaida. â\\x80\\x9cGuess\\r\\nit, Aglaya! But sheâ\\x80\\x99s pretty, prince, isnâ\\x80\\x99t she?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMost wonderfully so,â\\x80\\x9d said the latter, warmly, gazing at Aglaya with\\r\\nadmiration. â\\x80\\x9cAlmost as lovely as Nastasia Philipovna, but quite a\\r\\ndifferent type.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAll present exchanged looks of surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAs lovely as _who?_â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Epanchin. â\\x80\\x9cAs _Nastasia Philipovna?_\\r\\nWhere have you seen Nastasia Philipovna? What Nastasia Philipovna?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGavrila Ardalionovitch showed the general her portrait just now.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow so? Did he bring the portrait for my husband?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOnly to show it. Nastasia Philipovna gave it to Gavrila Ardalionovitch\\r\\ntoday, and the latter brought it here to show to the general.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI must see it!â\\x80\\x9d cried Mrs. Epanchin. â\\x80\\x9cWhere is the portrait? If she\\r\\ngave it to him, he must have it; and he is still in the study. He never\\r\\nleaves before four oâ\\x80\\x99clock on Wednesdays. Send for Gavrila\\r\\nArdalionovitch at once. No, I donâ\\x80\\x99t long to see _him_ so much. Look\\r\\nhere, dear prince, _be_ so kind, will you? Just step to the study and\\r\\nfetch this portrait! Say we want to look at it. Please do this for me,\\r\\nwill you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe is a nice fellow, but a little too simple,â\\x80\\x9d said Adelaida, as the\\r\\nprince left the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe is, indeed,â\\x80\\x9d said Alexandra; â\\x80\\x9calmost laughably so at times.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNeither one nor the other seemed to give expression to her full\\r\\nthoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe got out of it very neatly about our faces, though,â\\x80\\x9d said Aglaya.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe flattered us all round, even mamma.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNonsense!â\\x80\\x9d cried the latter. â\\x80\\x9cHe did not flatter me. It was I who\\r\\nfound his appreciation flattering. I think you are a great deal more\\r\\nfoolish than he is. He is simple, of course, but also very knowing.\\r\\nJust like myself.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow stupid of me to speak of the portrait,â\\x80\\x9d thought the prince as he\\r\\nentered the study, with a feeling of guilt at his heart, â\\x80\\x9cand yet,\\r\\nperhaps I was right after all.â\\x80\\x9d He had an idea, unformed as yet, but a\\r\\nstrange idea.\\r\\n\\r\\nGavrila Ardalionovitch was still sitting in the study, buried in a mass\\r\\nof papers. He looked as though he did not take his salary from the\\r\\npublic company, whose servant he was, for a sinecure.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe grew very wroth and confused when the prince asked for the portrait,\\r\\nand explained how it came about that he had spoken of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, curse it all,â\\x80\\x9d he said; â\\x80\\x9cwhat on earth must you go blabbing for?\\r\\nYou know nothing about the thing, and yetâ\\x80\\x94idiot!â\\x80\\x9d he added, muttering\\r\\nthe last word to himself in irrepressible rage.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am very sorry; I was not thinking at the time. I merely said that\\r\\nAglaya was almost as beautiful as Nastasia Philipovna.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nGania asked for further details; and the prince once more repeated the\\r\\nconversation. Gania looked at him with ironical contempt the while.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNastasia Philipovna,â\\x80\\x9d he began, and there paused; he was clearly much\\r\\nagitated and annoyed. The prince reminded him of the portrait.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cListen, prince,â\\x80\\x9d said Gania, as though an idea had just struck him, â\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nwish to ask you a great favour, and yet I really donâ\\x80\\x99t knowâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe paused again, he was trying to make up his mind to something, and\\r\\nwas turning the matter over. The prince waited quietly. Once more Gania\\r\\nfixed him with intent and questioning eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPrince,â\\x80\\x9d he began again, â\\x80\\x9cthey are rather angry with me, in there,\\r\\nowing to a circumstance which I need not explain, so that I do not care\\r\\nto go in at present without an invitation. I particularly wish to speak\\r\\nto Aglaya, but I have written a few words in case I shall not have the\\r\\nchance of seeing herâ\\x80\\x9d (here the prince observed a small note in his\\r\\nhand), â\\x80\\x9cand I do not know how to get my communication to her. Donâ\\x80\\x99t you\\r\\nthink you could undertake to give it to her at once, but only to her,\\r\\nmind, and so that no one else should see you give it? It isnâ\\x80\\x99t much of\\r\\na secret, but stillâ\\x80\\x94Well, will you do it?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t quite like it,â\\x80\\x9d replied the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, but it is absolutely necessary for me,â\\x80\\x9d Gania entreated. â\\x80\\x9cBelieve\\r\\nme, if it were not so, I would not ask you; how else am I to get it to\\r\\nher? It is most important, dreadfully important!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nGania was evidently much alarmed at the idea that the prince would not\\r\\nconsent to take his note, and he looked at him now with an expression\\r\\nof absolute entreaty.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, I will take it then.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut mind, nobody is to see!â\\x80\\x9d cried the delighted Gania â\\x80\\x9cAnd of course\\r\\nI may rely on your word of honour, eh?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI wonâ\\x80\\x99t show it to anyone,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe letter is not sealedâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d continued Gania, and paused in confusion.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, I wonâ\\x80\\x99t read it,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, quite simply.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took up the portrait, and went out of the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nGania, left alone, clutched his head with his hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOne word from her,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cone word from her, and I may yet be\\r\\nfree.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe could not settle himself to his papers again, for agitation and\\r\\nexcitement, but began walking up and down the room from corner to\\r\\ncorner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince walked along, musing. He did not like his commission, and\\r\\ndisliked the idea of Gania sending a note to Aglaya at all; but when he\\r\\nwas two rooms distant from the drawing-room, where they all were, he\\r\\nstopped as though recalling something; went to the window, nearer the\\r\\nlight, and began to examine the portrait in his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe longed to solve the mystery of something in the face of Nastasia\\r\\nPhilipovna, something which had struck him as he looked at the portrait\\r\\nfor the first time; the impression had not left him. It was partly the\\r\\nfact of her marvellous beauty that struck him, and partly something\\r\\nelse. There was a suggestion of immense pride and disdain in the face\\r\\nalmost of hatred, and at the same time something confiding and very\\r\\nfull of simplicity. The contrast aroused a deep sympathy in his heart\\r\\nas he looked at the lovely face. The blinding loveliness of it was\\r\\nalmost intolerable, this pale thin face with its flaming eyes; it was a\\r\\nstrange beauty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince gazed at it for a minute or two, then glanced around him,\\r\\nand hurriedly raised the portrait to his lips. When, a minute after, he\\r\\nreached the drawing-room door, his face was quite composed. But just as\\r\\nhe reached the door he met Aglaya coming out alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGavrila Ardalionovitch begged me to give you this,â\\x80\\x9d he said, handing\\r\\nher the note.\\r\\n\\r\\nAglaya stopped, took the letter, and gazed strangely into the princeâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\neyes. There was no confusion in her face; a little surprise, perhaps,\\r\\nbut that was all. By her look she seemed merely to challenge the prince\\r\\nto an explanation as to how he and Gania happened to be connected in\\r\\nthis matter. But her expression was perfectly cool and quiet, and even\\r\\ncondescending.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo they stood for a moment or two, confronting one another. At length a\\r\\nfaint smile passed over her face, and she passed by him without a word.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Epanchin examined the portrait of Nastasia Philipovna for some\\r\\nlittle while, holding it critically at armâ\\x80\\x99s length.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, she is pretty,â\\x80\\x9d she said at last, â\\x80\\x9ceven very pretty. I have seen\\r\\nher twice, but only at a distance. So you admire this kind of beauty,\\r\\ndo you?â\\x80\\x9d she asked the prince, suddenly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I doâ\\x80\\x94this kind.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you mean especially this kind?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, especially this kind.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere is much suffering in this face,â\\x80\\x9d murmured the prince, more as\\r\\nthough talking to himself than answering the question.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think you are wandering a little, prince,â\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Epanchin decided,\\r\\nafter a lengthened survey of his face; and she tossed the portrait on\\r\\nto the table, haughtily.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlexandra took it, and Adelaida came up, and both the girls examined\\r\\nthe photograph. Just then Aglaya entered the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat a power!â\\x80\\x9d cried Adelaida suddenly, as she earnestly examined the\\r\\nportrait over her sisterâ\\x80\\x99s shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhom? What power?â\\x80\\x9d asked her mother, crossly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSuch beauty is real power,â\\x80\\x9d said Adelaida. â\\x80\\x9cWith such beauty as that\\r\\none might overthrow the world.â\\x80\\x9d She returned to her easel thoughtfully.\\r\\n\\r\\nAglaya merely glanced at the portraitâ\\x80\\x94frowned, and put out her\\r\\nunderlip; then went and sat down on the sofa with folded hands. Mrs.\\r\\nEpanchin rang the bell.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAsk Gavrila Ardalionovitch to step this way,â\\x80\\x9d said she to the man who\\r\\nanswered.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMamma!â\\x80\\x9d cried Alexandra, significantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI shall just say two words to him, thatâ\\x80\\x99s all,â\\x80\\x9d said her mother,\\r\\nsilencing all objection by her manner; she was evidently seriously put\\r\\nout. â\\x80\\x9cYou see, prince, it is all secrets with us, just nowâ\\x80\\x94all secrets.\\r\\nIt seems to be the etiquette of the house, for some reason or other.\\r\\nStupid nonsense, and in a matter which ought to be approached with all\\r\\ncandour and open-heartedness. There is a marriage being talked of, and\\r\\nI donâ\\x80\\x99t like this marriageâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMamma, what are you saying?â\\x80\\x9d said Alexandra again, hurriedly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, what, my dear girl? As if you can possibly like it yourself? The\\r\\nheart is the great thing, and the rest is all rubbishâ\\x80\\x94though one must\\r\\nhave sense as well. Perhaps sense is really the great thing. Donâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nsmile like that, Aglaya. I donâ\\x80\\x99t contradict myself. A fool with a heart\\r\\nand no brains is just as unhappy as a fool with brains and no heart. I\\r\\nam one and you are the other, and therefore both of us suffer, both of\\r\\nus are unhappy.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy are you so unhappy, mother?â\\x80\\x9d asked Adelaida, who alone of all the\\r\\ncompany seemed to have preserved her good temper and spirits up to now.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn the first place, because of my carefully brought-up daughters,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nsaid Mrs. Epanchin, cuttingly; â\\x80\\x9cand as that is the best reason I can\\r\\ngive you we need not bother about any other at present. Enough of\\r\\nwords, now! We shall see how both of you (I donâ\\x80\\x99t count Aglaya) will\\r\\nmanage your business, and whether you, most revered Alexandra Ivanovna,\\r\\nwill be happy with your fine mate.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh!â\\x80\\x9d she added, as Gania suddenly entered the room, â\\x80\\x9chereâ\\x80\\x99s another\\r\\nmarrying subject. How do you do?â\\x80\\x9d she continued, in response to Ganiaâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nbow; but she did not invite him to sit down. â\\x80\\x9cYou are going to be\\r\\nmarried?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMarried? howâ\\x80\\x94what marriage?â\\x80\\x9d murmured Gania, overwhelmed with\\r\\nconfusion.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAre you about to take a wife? I ask,â\\x80\\x94if you prefer that expression.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, no Iâ\\x80\\x94Iâ\\x80\\x94no!â\\x80\\x9d said Gania, bringing out his lie with a tell-tale\\r\\nblush of shame. He glanced keenly at Aglaya, who was sitting some way\\r\\noff, and dropped his eyes immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\nAglaya gazed coldly, intently, and composedly at him, without taking\\r\\nher eyes off his face, and watched his confusion.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo? You say no, do you?â\\x80\\x9d continued the pitiless Mrs. General. â\\x80\\x9cVery\\r\\nwell, I shall remember that you told me this Wednesday morning, in\\r\\nanswer to my question, that you are not going to be married. What day\\r\\nis it, Wednesday, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I think so!â\\x80\\x9d said Adelaida.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou never know the day of the week; whatâ\\x80\\x99s the day of the month?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTwenty-seventh!â\\x80\\x9d said Gania.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTwenty-seventh; very well. Good-bye now; you have a good deal to do,\\r\\nIâ\\x80\\x99m sure, and I must dress and go out. Take your portrait. Give my\\r\\nrespects to your unfortunate mother, Nina Alexandrovna. _Au revoir_,\\r\\ndear prince, come in and see us often, do; and I shall tell old\\r\\nPrincess Bielokonski about you. I shall go and see her on purpose. And\\r\\nlisten, my dear boy, I feel sure that God has sent you to Petersburg\\r\\nfrom Switzerland on purpose for me. Maybe you will have other things to\\r\\ndo, besides, but you are sent chiefly for my sake, I feel sure of it.\\r\\nGod sent you to me! _Au revoir!_ Alexandra, come with me, my dear.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Epanchin left the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nGaniaâ\\x80\\x94confused, annoyed, furiousâ\\x80\\x94took up his portrait, and turned to\\r\\nthe prince with a nasty smile on his face.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPrince,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cI am just going home. If you have not changed your\\r\\nmind as to living with us, perhaps you would like to come with me. You\\r\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t know the address, I believe?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWait a minute, prince,â\\x80\\x9d said Aglaya, suddenly rising from her seat,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdo write something in my album first, will you? Father says you are a\\r\\nmost talented caligraphist; Iâ\\x80\\x99ll bring you my book in a minute.â\\x80\\x9d She\\r\\nleft the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, _au revoir_, prince,â\\x80\\x9d said Adelaida, â\\x80\\x9cI must be going too.â\\x80\\x9d She\\r\\npressed the princeâ\\x80\\x99s hand warmly, and gave him a friendly smile as she\\r\\nleft the room. She did not so much as look at Gania.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis is your doing, prince,â\\x80\\x9d said Gania, turning on the latter so soon\\r\\nas the others were all out of the room. â\\x80\\x9cThis is your doing, sir! _You_\\r\\nhave been telling them that I am going to be married!â\\x80\\x9d He said this in\\r\\na hurried whisper, his eyes flashing with rage and his face ablaze.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou shameless tattler!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI assure you, you are under a delusion,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, calmly and\\r\\npolitely. â\\x80\\x9cI did not even know that you were to be married.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou heard me talking about it, the general and me. You heard me say\\r\\nthat everything was to be settled today at Nastasia Philipovnaâ\\x80\\x99s, and\\r\\nyou went and blurted it out here. You lie if you deny it. Who else\\r\\ncould have told them? Devil take it, sir, who could have told them\\r\\nexcept yourself? Didnâ\\x80\\x99t the old woman as good as hint as much to me?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf she hinted to you who told her you must know best, of course; but I\\r\\nnever said a word about it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDid you give my note? Is there an answer?â\\x80\\x9d interrupted Gania,\\r\\nimpatiently.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut at this moment Aglaya came back, and the prince had no time to\\r\\nreply.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere, prince,â\\x80\\x9d said she, â\\x80\\x9cthereâ\\x80\\x99s my album. Now choose a page and\\r\\nwrite me something, will you? Thereâ\\x80\\x99s a pen, a new one; do you mind a\\r\\nsteel one? I have heard that you caligraphists donâ\\x80\\x99t like steel pens.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nConversing with the prince, Aglaya did not even seem to notice that\\r\\nGania was in the room. But while the prince was getting his pen ready,\\r\\nfinding a page, and making his preparations to write, Gania came up to\\r\\nthe fireplace where Aglaya was standing, to the right of the prince,\\r\\nand in trembling, broken accents said, almost in her ear:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOne word, just one word from you, and Iâ\\x80\\x99m saved.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince turned sharply round and looked at both of them. Ganiaâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nface was full of real despair; he seemed to have said the words almost\\r\\nunconsciously and on the impulse of the moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nAglaya gazed at him for some seconds with precisely the same composure\\r\\nand calm astonishment as she had shown a little while before, when the\\r\\nprince handed her the note, and it appeared that this calm surprise and\\r\\nseemingly absolute incomprehension of what was said to her, were more\\r\\nterribly overwhelming to Gania than even the most plainly expressed\\r\\ndisdain would have been.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat shall I write?â\\x80\\x9d asked the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll dictate to you,â\\x80\\x9d said Aglaya, coming up to the table. â\\x80\\x9cNow then,\\r\\nare you ready? Write, â\\x80\\x98I never condescend to bargain!â\\x80\\x99 Now put your\\r\\nname and the date. Let me see it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince handed her the album.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCapital! How beautifully you have written it! Thanks so much. _Au\\r\\nrevoir_, prince. Wait a minute,â\\x80\\x9d she added, â\\x80\\x9cI want to give you\\r\\nsomething for a keepsake. Come with me this way, will you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince followed her. Arrived at the dining-room, she stopped.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cRead this,â\\x80\\x9d she said, handing him Ganiaâ\\x80\\x99s note.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince took it from her hand, but gazed at her in bewilderment.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh! I _know_ you havenâ\\x80\\x99t read it, and that you could never be that\\r\\nmanâ\\x80\\x99s accomplice. Read it, I wish you to read it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe letter had evidently been written in a hurry:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy fate is to be decided todayâ\\x80\\x9d (it ran), â\\x80\\x9cyou know how. This day I\\r\\nmust give my word irrevocably. I have no right to ask your help, and I\\r\\ndare not allow myself to indulge in any hopes; but once you said just\\r\\none word, and that word lighted up the night of my life, and became the\\r\\nbeacon of my days. Say one more such word, and save me from utter ruin.\\r\\nOnly tell me, â\\x80\\x98break off the whole thing!â\\x80\\x99 and I will do so this very\\r\\nday. Oh! what can it cost you to say just this one word? In doing so\\r\\nyou will but be giving me a sign of your sympathy for me, and of your\\r\\npity; only this, only this; nothing more, _nothing_. I dare not indulge\\r\\nin any hope, because I am unworthy of it. But if you say but this word,\\r\\nI will take up my cross again with joy, and return once more to my\\r\\nbattle with poverty. I shall meet the storm and be glad of it; I shall\\r\\nrise up with renewed strength.\\r\\n    â\\x80\\x9cSend me back then this one word of sympathy, only sympathy, I\\r\\n    swear to you; and oh! do not be angry with the audacity of despair,\\r\\n    with the drowning man who has dared to make this last effort to\\r\\n    save himself from perishing beneath the waters.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cG.L.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis man assures me,â\\x80\\x9d said Aglaya, scornfully, when the prince had\\r\\nfinished reading the letter, â\\x80\\x9cthat the words â\\x80\\x98break off everythingâ\\x80\\x99 do\\r\\nnot commit me to anything whatever; and himself gives me a written\\r\\nguarantee to that effect, in this letter. Observe how ingenuously he\\r\\nunderlines certain words, and how crudely he glosses over his hidden\\r\\nthoughts. He must know that if he â\\x80\\x98broke off everything,â\\x80\\x99 _first_, by\\r\\nhimself, and without telling me a word about it or having the slightest\\r\\nhope on my account, that in that case I should perhaps be able to\\r\\nchange my opinion of him, and even accept hisâ\\x80\\x94friendship. He must know\\r\\nthat, but his soul is such a wretched thing. He knows it and cannot\\r\\nmake up his mind; he knows it and yet asks for guarantees. He cannot\\r\\nbring himself to _trust_, he wants me to give him hopes of myself\\r\\nbefore he lets go of his hundred thousand roubles. As to the â\\x80\\x98former\\r\\nwordâ\\x80\\x99 which he declares â\\x80\\x98lighted up the night of his life,â\\x80\\x99 he is\\r\\nsimply an impudent liar; I merely pitied him once. But he is audacious\\r\\nand shameless. He immediately began to hope, at that very moment. I saw\\r\\nit. He has tried to catch me ever since; he is still fishing for me.\\r\\nWell, enough of this. Take the letter and give it back to him, as soon\\r\\nas you have left our house; not before, of course.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd what shall I tell him by way of answer?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNothingâ\\x80\\x94of course! Thatâ\\x80\\x99s the best answer. Is it the case that you are\\r\\ngoing to live in his house?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, your father kindly recommended me to him.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen look out for him, I warn you! He wonâ\\x80\\x99t forgive you easily, for\\r\\ntaking back the letter.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAglaya pressed the princeâ\\x80\\x99s hand and left the room. Her face was\\r\\nserious and frowning; she did not even smile as she nodded good-bye to\\r\\nhim at the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll just get my parcel and weâ\\x80\\x99ll go,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince to Gania, as he\\r\\nre-entered the drawing-room. Gania stamped his foot with impatience.\\r\\nHis face looked dark and gloomy with rage.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last they left the house behind them, the prince carrying his\\r\\nbundle.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe answerâ\\x80\\x94quickâ\\x80\\x94the answer!â\\x80\\x9d said Gania, the instant they were\\r\\noutside. â\\x80\\x9cWhat did she say? Did you give the letter?â\\x80\\x9d The prince\\r\\nsilently held out the note. Gania was struck motionless with amazement.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow, what? my letter?â\\x80\\x9d he cried. â\\x80\\x9cHe never delivered it! I might have\\r\\nguessed it, oh! curse him! Of course she did not understand what I\\r\\nmeant, naturally! Whyâ\\x80\\x94whyâ\\x80\\x94_why_ didnâ\\x80\\x99t you give her the note, youâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExcuse me; I was able to deliver it almost immediately after receiving\\r\\nyour commission, and I gave it, too, just as you asked me to. It has\\r\\ncome into my hands now because Aglaya Ivanovna has just returned it to\\r\\nme.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow? When?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAs soon as I finished writing in her album for her, and when she asked\\r\\nme to come out of the room with her (you heard?), we went into the\\r\\ndining-room, and she gave me your letter to read, and then told me to\\r\\nreturn it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTo _read?_â\\x80\\x9d cried Gania, almost at the top of his voice; â\\x80\\x9cto _read_,\\r\\nand you read it?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd again he stood like a log in the middle of the pavement; so amazed\\r\\nthat his mouth remained open after the last word had left it.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I have just read it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd she gave it you to read herselfâ\\x80\\x94_herself?_â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, herself; and you may believe me when I tell you that I would not\\r\\nhave read it for anything without her permission.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nGania was silent for a minute or two, as though thinking out some\\r\\nproblem. Suddenly he cried:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s impossible, she cannot have given it to you to read! You are\\r\\nlying. You read it yourself!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am telling you the truth,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince in his former composed\\r\\ntone of voice; â\\x80\\x9cand believe me, I am extremely sorry that the\\r\\ncircumstance should have made such an unpleasant impression upon you!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut, you wretched man, at least she must have said something? There\\r\\nmust be _some_ answer from her!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, of course, she did say something!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOut with it then, damn it! Out with it at once!â\\x80\\x9d and Gania stamped his\\r\\nfoot twice on the pavement.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAs soon as I had finished reading it, she told me that you were\\r\\nfishing for her; that you wished to compromise her so far as to receive\\r\\nsome hopes from her, trusting to which hopes you might break with the\\r\\nprospect of receiving a hundred thousand roubles. She said that if you\\r\\nhad done this without bargaining with her, if you had broken with the\\r\\nmoney prospects without trying to force a guarantee out of her first,\\r\\nshe might have been your friend. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s all, I think. Oh no, when I\\r\\nasked her what I was to say, as I took the letter, she replied that â\\x80\\x98no\\r\\nanswer is the best answer.â\\x80\\x99 I think that was it. Forgive me if I do not\\r\\nuse her exact expressions. I tell you the sense as I understood it\\r\\nmyself.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nUngovernable rage and madness took entire possession of Gania, and his\\r\\nfury burst out without the least attempt at restraint.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh! thatâ\\x80\\x99s it, is it!â\\x80\\x9d he yelled. â\\x80\\x9cShe throws my letters out of the\\r\\nwindow, does she! Oh! and she does not condescend to bargain, while I\\r\\n_do_, eh? We shall see, we shall see! I shall pay her out for this.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe twisted himself about with rage, and grew paler and paler; he shook\\r\\nhis fist. So the pair walked along a few steps. Gania did not stand on\\r\\nceremony with the prince; he behaved just as though he were alone in\\r\\nhis room. He clearly counted the latter as a nonentity. But suddenly he\\r\\nseemed to have an idea, and recollected himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut how was it?â\\x80\\x9d he asked, â\\x80\\x9chow was it that you (idiot that you are),â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nhe added to himself, â\\x80\\x9cwere so very confidential a couple of hours after\\r\\nyour first meeting with these people? How was that, eh?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nUp to this moment jealousy had not been one of his torments; now it\\r\\nsuddenly gnawed at his heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is a thing I cannot undertake to explain,â\\x80\\x9d replied the prince.\\r\\nGania looked at him with angry contempt.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh! I suppose the present she wished to make to you, when she took you\\r\\ninto the dining-room, was her confidence, eh?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI suppose that was it; I cannot explain it otherwise.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut why, _why?_ Devil take it, what did you do in there? Why did they\\r\\nfancy you? Look here, canâ\\x80\\x99t you remember exactly what you said to them,\\r\\nfrom the very beginning? Canâ\\x80\\x99t you remember?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, we talked of a great many things. When first I went in we began to\\r\\nspeak of Switzerland.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, the devil take Switzerland!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen about executions.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExecutions?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYesâ\\x80\\x94at least about one. Then I told the whole three yearsâ\\x80\\x99 story of my\\r\\nlife, and the history of a poor peasant girlâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, damn the peasant girl! go on, go on!â\\x80\\x9d said Gania, impatiently.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen how Schneider told me about my childish nature, andâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, _curse_ Schneider and his dirty opinions! Go on.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen I began to talk about faces, at least about the _expressions_ of\\r\\nfaces, and said that Aglaya Ivanovna was nearly as lovely as Nastasia\\r\\nPhilipovna. It was then I blurted out about the portraitâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut you didnâ\\x80\\x99t repeat what you heard in the study? You didnâ\\x80\\x99t repeat\\r\\nthatâ\\x80\\x94eh?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I tell you I did _not_.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen how did theyâ\\x80\\x94look here! Did Aglaya show my letter to the old\\r\\nlady?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, there I can give you my fullest assurance that she did _not_. I\\r\\nwas there all the whileâ\\x80\\x94she had no time to do it!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut perhaps you may not have observed it, oh, you damned idiot, you!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nhe shouted, quite beside himself with fury. â\\x80\\x9cYou canâ\\x80\\x99t even describe\\r\\nwhat went on.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nGania having once descended to abuse, and receiving no check, very soon\\r\\nknew no bounds or limit to his licence, as is often the way in such\\r\\ncases. His rage so blinded him that he had not even been able to detect\\r\\nthat this â\\x80\\x9cidiot,â\\x80\\x9d whom he was abusing to such an extent, was very far\\r\\nfrom being slow of comprehension, and had a way of taking in an\\r\\nimpression, and afterwards giving it out again, which was very\\r\\nun-idiotic indeed. But something a little unforeseen now occurred.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think I ought to tell you, Gavrila Ardalionovitch,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince,\\r\\nsuddenly, â\\x80\\x9cthat though I once was so ill that I really was little\\r\\nbetter than an idiot, yet now I am almost recovered, and that,\\r\\ntherefore, it is not altogether pleasant to be called an idiot to my\\r\\nface. Of course your anger is excusable, considering the treatment you\\r\\nhave just experienced; but I must remind you that you have twice abused\\r\\nme rather rudely. I do not like this sort of thing, and especially so\\r\\nat the first time of meeting a man, and, therefore, as we happen to be\\r\\nat this moment standing at a crossroad, donâ\\x80\\x99t you think we had better\\r\\npart, you to the left, homewards, and I to the right, here? I have\\r\\ntwenty-five roubles, and I shall easily find a lodging.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nGania was much confused, and blushed for shame â\\x80\\x9cDo forgive me, prince!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nhe cried, suddenly changing his abusive tone for one of great courtesy.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFor Heavenâ\\x80\\x99s sake, forgive me! You see what a miserable plight I am\\r\\nin, but you hardly know anything of the facts of the case as yet. If\\r\\nyou did, I am sure you would forgive me, at least partially. Of course\\r\\nit was inexcusable of me, I know, butâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, dear me, I really do not require such profuse apologies,â\\x80\\x9d replied\\r\\nthe prince, hastily. â\\x80\\x9cI quite understand how unpleasant your position\\r\\nis, and that is what made you abuse me. So come along to your house,\\r\\nafter all. I shall be delightedâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am not going to let him go like this,â\\x80\\x9d thought Gania, glancing\\r\\nangrily at the prince as they walked along. â\\x80\\x9cThe fellow has sucked\\r\\neverything out of me, and now he takes off his maskâ\\x80\\x94thereâ\\x80\\x99s something\\r\\nmore than appears, here we shall see. It shall all be as clear as water\\r\\nby tonight, everything!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut by this time they had reached Ganiaâ\\x80\\x99s house.\\r\\n\\r\\nVIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flat occupied by Gania and his family was on the third floor of the\\r\\nhouse. It was reached by a clean light staircase, and consisted of\\r\\nseven rooms, a nice enough lodging, and one would have thought a little\\r\\ntoo good for a clerk on two thousand roubles a year. But it was\\r\\ndesigned to accommodate a few lodgers on board terms, and had been\\r\\ntaken a few months since, much to the disgust of Gania, at the urgent\\r\\nrequest of his mother and his sister, Varvara Ardalionovna, who longed\\r\\nto do something to increase the family income a little, and fixed their\\r\\nhopes upon letting lodgings. Gania frowned upon the idea. He thought it\\r\\n_infra dig_, and did not quite like appearing in society\\r\\nafterwardsâ\\x80\\x94that society in which he had been accustomed to pose up to\\r\\nnow as a young man of rather brilliant prospects. All these concessions\\r\\nand rebuffs of fortune, of late, had wounded his spirit severely, and\\r\\nhis temper had become extremely irritable, his wrath being generally\\r\\nquite out of proportion to the cause. But if he had made up his mind to\\r\\nput up with this sort of life for a while, it was only on the plain\\r\\nunderstanding with his inner self that he would very soon change it\\r\\nall, and have things as he chose again. Yet the very means by which he\\r\\nhoped to make this change threatened to involve him in even greater\\r\\ndifficulties than he had had before.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flat was divided by a passage which led straight out of the\\r\\nentrance-hall. Along one side of this corridor lay the three rooms\\r\\nwhich were designed for the accommodation of the â\\x80\\x9chighly recommendedâ\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nlodgers. Besides these three rooms there was another small one at the\\r\\nend of the passage, close to the kitchen, which was allotted to General\\r\\nIvolgin, the nominal master of the house, who slept on a wide sofa, and\\r\\nwas obliged to pass into and out of his room through the kitchen, and\\r\\nup or down the back stairs. Colia, Ganiaâ\\x80\\x99s young brother, a school-boy\\r\\nof thirteen, shared this room with his father. He, too, had to sleep on\\r\\nan old sofa, a narrow, uncomfortable thing with a torn rug over it; his\\r\\nchief duty being to look after his father, who needed to be watched\\r\\nmore and more every day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince was given the middle room of the three, the first being\\r\\noccupied by one Ferdishenko, while the third was empty.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Gania first conducted the prince to the family apartments. These\\r\\nconsisted of a â\\x80\\x9csalon,â\\x80\\x9d which became the dining-room when required; a\\r\\ndrawing-room, which was only a drawing-room in the morning, and became\\r\\nGaniaâ\\x80\\x99s study in the evening, and his bedroom at night; and lastly Nina\\r\\nAlexandrovnaâ\\x80\\x99s and Varvaraâ\\x80\\x99s bedroom, a small, close chamber which they\\r\\nshared together.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a word, the whole place was confined, and a â\\x80\\x9ctight fitâ\\x80\\x9d for the\\r\\nparty. Gania used to grind his teeth with rage over the state of\\r\\naffairs; though he was anxious to be dutiful and polite to his mother.\\r\\nHowever, it was very soon apparent to anyone coming into the house,\\r\\nthat Gania was the tyrant of the family.\\r\\n\\r\\nNina Alexandrovna and her daughter were both seated in the\\r\\ndrawing-room, engaged in knitting, and talking to a visitor, Ivan\\r\\nPetrovitch Ptitsin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lady of the house appeared to be a woman of about fifty years of\\r\\nage, thin-faced, and with black lines under the eyes. She looked ill\\r\\nand rather sad; but her face was a pleasant one for all that; and from\\r\\nthe first word that fell from her lips, any stranger would at once\\r\\nconclude that she was of a serious and particularly sincere nature. In\\r\\nspite of her sorrowful expression, she gave the idea of possessing\\r\\nconsiderable firmness and decision.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer dress was modest and simple to a degree, dark and elderly in style;\\r\\nbut both her face and appearance gave evidence that she had seen better\\r\\ndays.\\r\\n\\r\\nVarvara was a girl of some twenty-three summers, of middle height,\\r\\nthin, but possessing a face which, without being actually beautiful,\\r\\nhad the rare quality of charm, and might fascinate even to the extent\\r\\nof passionate regard.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was very like her mother: she even dressed like her, which proved\\r\\nthat she had no taste for smart clothes. The expression of her grey\\r\\neyes was merry and gentle, when it was not, as lately, too full of\\r\\nthought and anxiety. The same decision and firmness was to be observed\\r\\nin her face as in her motherâ\\x80\\x99s, but her strength seemed to be more\\r\\nvigorous than that of Nina Alexandrovna. She was subject to outbursts\\r\\nof temper, of which even her brother was a little afraid.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe present visitor, Ptitsin, was also afraid of her. This was a young\\r\\nfellow of something under thirty, dressed plainly, but neatly. His\\r\\nmanners were good, but rather ponderously so. His dark beard bore\\r\\nevidence to the fact that he was not in any government employ. He could\\r\\nspeak well, but preferred silence. On the whole he made a decidedly\\r\\nagreeable impression. He was clearly attracted by Varvara, and made no\\r\\nsecret of his feelings. She trusted him in a friendly way, but had not\\r\\nshown him any decided encouragement as yet, which fact did not quell\\r\\nhis ardour in the least.\\r\\n\\r\\nNina Alexandrovna was very fond of him, and had grown quite\\r\\nconfidential with him of late. Ptitsin, as was well known, was engaged\\r\\nin the business of lending out money on good security, and at a good\\r\\nrate of interest. He was a great friend of Ganiaâ\\x80\\x99s.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a formal introduction by Gania (who greeted his mother very\\r\\nshortly, took no notice of his sister, and immediately marched Ptitsin\\r\\nout of the room), Nina Alexandrovna addressed a few kind words to the\\r\\nprince and forthwith requested Colia, who had just appeared at the\\r\\ndoor, to show him to the â\\x80\\x9cmiddle room.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nColia was a nice-looking boy. His expression was simple and confiding,\\r\\nand his manners were very polite and engaging.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhereâ\\x80\\x99s your luggage?â\\x80\\x9d he asked, as he led the prince away to his\\r\\nroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI had a bundle; itâ\\x80\\x99s in the entrance hall.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll bring it you directly. We only have a cook and one maid, so I\\r\\nhave to help as much as I can. Varia looks after things, generally, and\\r\\nloses her temper over it. Gania says you have only just arrived from\\r\\nSwitzerland?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs it jolly there?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMountains?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll go and get your bundle.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Varvara joined them.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe maid shall bring your bed-linen directly. Have you a portmanteau?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo; a bundleâ\\x80\\x94your brother has just gone to the hall for it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing there except this,â\\x80\\x9d said Colia, returning at this\\r\\nmoment. â\\x80\\x9cWhere did you put it?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh! but thatâ\\x80\\x99s all I have,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, taking it.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh! I thought perhaps Ferdishenko had taken it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t talk nonsense,â\\x80\\x9d said Varia, severely. She seemed put out, and\\r\\nwas only just polite with the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOho!â\\x80\\x9d laughed the boy, â\\x80\\x9cyou can be nicer than that to _me_, you\\r\\nknowâ\\x80\\x94Iâ\\x80\\x99m not Ptitsin!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou ought to be whipped, Colia, you silly boy. If you want anythingâ\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n(to the prince) â\\x80\\x9cplease apply to the servant. We dine at half-past\\r\\nfour. You can take your dinner with us, or have it in your room, just\\r\\nas you please. Come along, Colia, donâ\\x80\\x99t disturb the prince.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the door they met Gania coming in.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs father in?â\\x80\\x9d he asked. Colia whispered something in his ear and went\\r\\nout.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cJust a couple of words, prince, if youâ\\x80\\x99ll excuse me. Donâ\\x80\\x99t blab over\\r\\n_there_ about what you may see here, or in this house as to all that\\r\\nabout Aglaya and me, you know. Things are not altogether pleasant in\\r\\nthis establishmentâ\\x80\\x94devil take it all! Youâ\\x80\\x99ll see. At all events keep\\r\\nyour tongue to yourself for _today_.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI assure you I â\\x80\\x98blabbedâ\\x80\\x99 a great deal less than you seem to suppose,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nsaid the prince, with some annoyance. Clearly the relations between\\r\\nGania and himself were by no means improving.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh well; I caught it quite hot enough today, thanks to you. However, I\\r\\nforgive you.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think you might fairly remember that I was not in any way bound, I\\r\\nhad no reason to be silent about that portrait. You never asked me not\\r\\nto mention it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPfu! what a wretched room this isâ\\x80\\x94dark, and the window looking into\\r\\nthe yard. Your coming to our house is, in no respect, opportune.\\r\\nHowever, itâ\\x80\\x99s not _my_ affair. I donâ\\x80\\x99t keep the lodgings.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPtitsin here looked in and beckoned to Gania, who hastily left the\\r\\nroom, in spite of the fact that he had evidently wished to say\\r\\nsomething more and had only made the remark about the room to gain\\r\\ntime. The prince had hardly had time to wash and tidy himself a little\\r\\nwhen the door opened once more, and another figure appeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was a gentleman of about thirty, tall, broad-shouldered, and\\r\\nred-haired; his face was red, too, and he possessed a pair of thick\\r\\nlips, a wide nose, small eyes, rather bloodshot, and with an ironical\\r\\nexpression in them; as though he were perpetually winking at someone.\\r\\nHis whole appearance gave one the idea of impudence; his dress was\\r\\nshabby.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe opened the door just enough to let his head in. His head remained so\\r\\nplaced for a few seconds while he quietly scrutinized the room; the\\r\\ndoor then opened enough to admit his body; but still he did not enter.\\r\\nHe stood on the threshold and examined the prince carefully. At last he\\r\\ngave the door a final shove, entered, approached the prince, took his\\r\\nhand and seated himself and the owner of the room on two chairs side by\\r\\nside.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFerdishenko,â\\x80\\x9d he said, gazing intently and inquiringly into the\\r\\nprinceâ\\x80\\x99s eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery well, what next?â\\x80\\x9d said the latter, almost laughing in his face.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA lodger here,â\\x80\\x9d continued the other, staring as before.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you wish to make acquaintance?â\\x80\\x9d asked the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh!â\\x80\\x9d said the visitor, passing his fingers through his hair and\\r\\nsighing. He then looked over to the other side of the room and around\\r\\nit. â\\x80\\x9cGot any money?â\\x80\\x9d he asked, suddenly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot much.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow much?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTwenty-five roubles.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLetâ\\x80\\x99s see it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince took his banknote out and showed it to Ferdishenko. The\\r\\nlatter unfolded it and looked at it; then he turned it round and\\r\\nexamined the other side; then he held it up to the light.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow strange that it should have browned so,â\\x80\\x9d he said, reflectively.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThese twenty-five rouble notes brown in a most extraordinary way,\\r\\nwhile other notes often grow paler. Take it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince took his note. Ferdishenko rose.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI came here to warn you,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cIn the first place, donâ\\x80\\x99t lend me\\r\\nany money, for I shall certainly ask you to.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery well.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShall you pay here?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I intend to.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh! I _donâ\\x80\\x99t_ intend to. Thanks. I live here, next door to you; you\\r\\nnoticed a room, did you? Donâ\\x80\\x99t come to me very often; I shall see you\\r\\nhere quite often enough. Have you seen the general?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNor heard him?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo; of course not.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, youâ\\x80\\x99ll both hear and see him soon; he even tries to borrow money\\r\\nfrom me. _Avis au lecteur._ Good-bye; do you think a man can possibly\\r\\nlive with a name like Ferdishenko?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy not?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood-bye.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so he departed. The prince found out afterwards that this gentleman\\r\\nmade it his business to amaze people with his originality and wit, but\\r\\nthat it did not as a rule â\\x80\\x9ccome off.â\\x80\\x9d He even produced a bad impression\\r\\non some people, which grieved him sorely; but he did not change his\\r\\nways for all that.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he went out of the princeâ\\x80\\x99s room, he collided with yet another\\r\\nvisitor coming in. Ferdishenko took the opportunity of making several\\r\\nwarning gestures to the prince from behind the new arrivalâ\\x80\\x99s back, and\\r\\nleft the room in conscious pride.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis next arrival was a tall red-faced man of about fifty-five, with\\r\\ngreyish hair and whiskers, and large eyes which stood out of their\\r\\nsockets. His appearance would have been distinguished had it not been\\r\\nthat he gave the idea of being rather dirty. He was dressed in an old\\r\\ncoat, and he smelled of vodka when he came near. His walk was\\r\\neffective, and he clearly did his best to appear dignified, and to\\r\\nimpress people by his manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis gentleman now approached the prince slowly, and with a most\\r\\ncourteous smile; silently took his hand and held it in his own, as he\\r\\nexamined the princeâ\\x80\\x99s features as though searching for familiar traits\\r\\ntherein.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Tis he, â\\x80\\x98tis he!â\\x80\\x9d he said at last, quietly, but with much solemnity.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAs though he were alive once more. I heard the familiar nameâ\\x80\\x94the dear\\r\\nfamiliar nameâ\\x80\\x94and, oh! how it reminded me of the irrevocable\\r\\npastâ\\x80\\x94Prince Muishkin, I believe?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExactly so.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGeneral Ivolginâ\\x80\\x94retired and unfortunate. May I ask your Christian and\\r\\ngeneric names?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLef Nicolaievitch.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo, soâ\\x80\\x94the son of my old, I may say my childhoodâ\\x80\\x99s friend, Nicolai\\r\\nPetrovitch.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy fatherâ\\x80\\x99s name was Nicolai Lvovitch.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLvovitch,â\\x80\\x9d repeated the general without the slightest haste, and with\\r\\nperfect confidence, just as though he had not committed himself the\\r\\nleast in the world, but merely made a little slip of the tongue. He sat\\r\\ndown, and taking the princeâ\\x80\\x99s hand, drew him to a seat next to himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI carried you in my arms as a baby,â\\x80\\x9d he observed.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cReally?â\\x80\\x9d asked the prince. â\\x80\\x9cWhy, itâ\\x80\\x99s twenty years since my father\\r\\ndied.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, yesâ\\x80\\x94twenty years and three months. We were educated together; I\\r\\nwent straight into the army, and heâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy father went into the army, too. He was a sub-lieutenant in the\\r\\nVasiliefsky regiment.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, sirâ\\x80\\x94in the Bielomirsky; he changed into the latter shortly before\\r\\nhis death. I was at his bedside when he died, and gave him my blessing\\r\\nfor eternity. Your motherâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d The general paused, as though overcome with\\r\\nemotion.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe died a few months later, from a cold,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, not coldâ\\x80\\x94believe an old manâ\\x80\\x94not from a cold, but from grief for\\r\\nher prince. Ohâ\\x80\\x94your mother, your mother! heigh-ho! Youthâ\\x80\\x94youth! Your\\r\\nfather and Iâ\\x80\\x94old friends as we wereâ\\x80\\x94nearly murdered each other for her\\r\\nsake.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince began to be a little incredulous.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was passionately in love with her when she was engagedâ\\x80\\x94engaged to my\\r\\nfriend. The prince noticed the fact and was furious. He came and woke\\r\\nme at seven oâ\\x80\\x99clock one morning. I rise and dress in amazement; silence\\r\\non both sides. I understand it all. He takes a couple of pistols out of\\r\\nhis pocketâ\\x80\\x94across a handkerchiefâ\\x80\\x94without witnesses. Why invite\\r\\nwitnesses when both of us would be walking in eternity in a couple of\\r\\nminutes? The pistols are loaded; we stretch the handkerchief and stand\\r\\nopposite one another. We aim the pistols at each otherâ\\x80\\x99s hearts.\\r\\nSuddenly tears start to our eyes, our hands shake; we weep, we\\r\\nembraceâ\\x80\\x94the battle is one of self-sacrifice now! The prince shouts,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98She is yours;â\\x80\\x99 I cry, â\\x80\\x98She is yoursâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x99 in a word, in a wordâ\\x80\\x94Youâ\\x80\\x99ve come\\r\\nto live with us, hey?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYesâ\\x80\\x94yesâ\\x80\\x94for a while, I think,â\\x80\\x9d stammered the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPrince, mother begs you to come to her,â\\x80\\x9d said Colia, appearing at the\\r\\ndoor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince rose to go, but the general once more laid his hand in a\\r\\nfriendly manner on his shoulder, and dragged him down on to the sofa.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAs the true friend of your father, I wish to say a few words to you,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nhe began. â\\x80\\x9cI have sufferedâ\\x80\\x94there was a catastrophe. I suffered without\\r\\na trial; I had no trial. Nina Alexandrovna my wife, is an excellent\\r\\nwoman, so is my daughter Varvara. We have to let lodgings because we\\r\\nare poorâ\\x80\\x94a dreadful, unheard-of come-down for usâ\\x80\\x94for me, who should\\r\\nhave been a governor-general; but we are very glad to have _you_, at\\r\\nall events. Meanwhile there is a tragedy in the house.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince looked inquiringly at the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, a marriage is being arrangedâ\\x80\\x94a marriage between a questionable\\r\\nwoman and a young fellow who might be a flunkey. They wish to bring\\r\\nthis woman into the house where my wife and daughter reside, but while\\r\\nI live and breathe she shall never enter my doors. I shall lie at the\\r\\nthreshold, and she shall trample me underfoot if she does. I hardly\\r\\ntalk to Gania now, and avoid him as much as I can. I warn you of this\\r\\nbeforehand, but you cannot fail to observe it. But you are the son of\\r\\nmy old friend, and I hopeâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPrince, be so kind as to come to me for a moment in the drawing-room,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nsaid Nina Alexandrovna herself, appearing at the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cImagine, my dear,â\\x80\\x9d cried the general, â\\x80\\x9cit turns out that I have nursed\\r\\nthe prince on my knee in the old days.â\\x80\\x9d His wife looked searchingly at\\r\\nhim, and glanced at the prince, but said nothing. The prince rose and\\r\\nfollowed her; but hardly had they reached the drawing-room, and Nina\\r\\nAlexandrovna had begun to talk hurriedly, when in came the general. She\\r\\nimmediately relapsed into silence. The master of the house may have\\r\\nobserved this, but at all events he did not take any notice of it; he\\r\\nwas in high good humour.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA son of my old friend, dear,â\\x80\\x9d he cried; â\\x80\\x9csurely you must remember\\r\\nPrince Nicolai Lvovitch? You saw him atâ\\x80\\x94at Tver.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t remember any Nicolai Lvovitch. Was that your father?â\\x80\\x9d she\\r\\ninquired of the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, but he died at Elizabethgrad, not at Tver,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince,\\r\\nrather timidly. â\\x80\\x9cSo Pavlicheff told me.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, Tver,â\\x80\\x9d insisted the general; â\\x80\\x9che removed just before his death.\\r\\nYou were very small and cannot remember; and Pavlicheff, though an\\r\\nexcellent fellow, may have made a mistake.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou knew Pavlicheff then?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, yesâ\\x80\\x94a wonderful fellow; but I was present myself. I gave him my\\r\\nblessing.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy father was just about to be tried when he died,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9calthough I never knew of what he was accused. He died in hospital.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh! it was the Kolpakoff business, and of course he would have been\\r\\nacquitted.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes? Do you know that for a fact?â\\x80\\x9d asked the prince, whose curiosity\\r\\nwas aroused by the generalâ\\x80\\x99s words.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI should think so indeed!â\\x80\\x9d cried the latter. â\\x80\\x9cThe court-martial came\\r\\nto no decision. It was a mysterious, an impossible business, one might\\r\\nsay! Captain Larionoff, commander of the company, had died; his command\\r\\nwas handed over to the prince for the moment. Very well. This soldier,\\r\\nKolpakoff, stole some leather from one of his comrades, intending to\\r\\nsell it, and spent the money on drink. Well! The princeâ\\x80\\x94you understand\\r\\nthat what follows took place in the presence of the sergeant-major, and\\r\\na corporalâ\\x80\\x94the prince rated Kolpakoff soundly, and threatened to have\\r\\nhim flogged. Well, Kolpakoff went back to the barracks, lay down on a\\r\\ncamp bedstead, and in a quarter of an hour was dead: you quite\\r\\nunderstand? It was, as I said, a strange, almost impossible, affair. In\\r\\ndue course Kolpakoff was buried; the prince wrote his report, the\\r\\ndeceasedâ\\x80\\x99s name was removed from the roll. All as it should be, is it\\r\\nnot? But exactly three months later at the inspection of the brigade,\\r\\nthe man Kolpakoff was found in the third company of the second\\r\\nbattalion of infantry, Novozemlianski division, just as if nothing had\\r\\nhappened!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat?â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, much astonished.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt did not occurâ\\x80\\x94itâ\\x80\\x99s a mistake!â\\x80\\x9d said Nina Alexandrovna quickly,\\r\\nlooking, at the prince rather anxiously. â\\x80\\x9c_Mon mari se trompe_,â\\x80\\x9d she\\r\\nadded, speaking in French.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear, â\\x80\\x98_se trompe_â\\x80\\x99 is easily said. Do you remember any case at all\\r\\nlike it? Everybody was at their witsâ\\x80\\x99 end. I should be the first to say\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98_quâ\\x80\\x99on se trompe_,â\\x80\\x99 but unfortunately I was an eye-witness, and was\\r\\nalso on the commission of inquiry. Everything proved that it was really\\r\\nhe, the very same soldier Kolpakoff who had been given the usual\\r\\nmilitary funeral to the sound of the drum. It is of course a most\\r\\ncurious caseâ\\x80\\x94nearly an impossible one. I recognize that... butâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFather, your dinner is ready,â\\x80\\x9d said Varvara at this point, putting her\\r\\nhead in at the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery glad, Iâ\\x80\\x99m particularly hungry. Yes, yes, a strange\\r\\ncoincidenceâ\\x80\\x94almost a psychologicalâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYour soupâ\\x80\\x99ll be cold; do come.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cComing, coming,â\\x80\\x9d said the general. â\\x80\\x9cSon of my old friendâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d he was\\r\\nheard muttering as he went down the passage.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou will have to excuse very much in my husband, if you stay with us,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nsaid Nina Alexandrovna; â\\x80\\x9cbut he will not disturb you often. He dines\\r\\nalone. Everyone has his little peculiarities, you know, and some people\\r\\nperhaps have more than those who are most pointed at and laughed at.\\r\\nOne thing I must beg of youâ\\x80\\x94if my husband applies to you for payment\\r\\nfor board and lodging, tell him that you have already paid me. Of\\r\\ncourse anything paid by you to the general would be as fully settled as\\r\\nif paid to me, so far as you are concerned; but I wish it to be so, if\\r\\nyou please, for convenienceâ\\x80\\x99 sake. What is it, Varia?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nVaria had quietly entered the room, and was holding out the portrait of\\r\\nNastasia Philipovna to her mother.\\r\\n\\r\\nNina Alexandrovna started, and examined the photograph intently, gazing\\r\\nat it long and sadly. At last she looked up inquiringly at Varia.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a present from herself to him,â\\x80\\x9d said Varia; â\\x80\\x9cthe question is to\\r\\nbe finally decided this evening.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis evening!â\\x80\\x9d repeated her mother in a tone of despair, but softly,\\r\\nas though to herself. â\\x80\\x9cThen itâ\\x80\\x99s all settled, of course, and thereâ\\x80\\x99s no\\r\\nhope left to us. She has anticipated her answer by the present of her\\r\\nportrait. Did he show it you himself?â\\x80\\x9d she added, in some surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou know we have hardly spoken to each other for a whole month.\\r\\nPtitsin told me all about it; and the photo was lying under the table,\\r\\nand I picked it up.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPrince,â\\x80\\x9d asked Nina Alexandrovna, â\\x80\\x9cI wanted to inquire whether you\\r\\nhave known my son long? I think he said that you had only arrived today\\r\\nfrom somewhere.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince gave a short narrative of what we have heard before, leaving\\r\\nout the greater part. The two ladies listened intently.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI did not ask about Gania out of curiosity,â\\x80\\x9d said the elder, at last.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI wish to know how much you know about him, because he said just now\\r\\nthat we need not stand on ceremony with you. What, exactly, does that\\r\\nmean?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this moment Gania and Ptitsin entered the room together, and Nina\\r\\nAlexandrovna immediately became silent again. The prince remained\\r\\nseated next to her, but Varia moved to the other end of the room; the\\r\\nportrait of Nastasia Philipovna remained lying as before on the\\r\\nwork-table. Gania observed it there, and with a frown of annoyance\\r\\nsnatched it up and threw it across to his writing-table, which stood at\\r\\nthe other end of the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs it today, Gania?â\\x80\\x9d asked Nina Alexandrovna, at last.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs what today?â\\x80\\x9d cried the former. Then suddenly recollecting himself,\\r\\nhe turned sharply on the prince. â\\x80\\x9cOh,â\\x80\\x9d he growled, â\\x80\\x9cI see, you are\\r\\nhere, that explains it! Is it a disease, or what, that you canâ\\x80\\x99t hold\\r\\nyour tongue? Look here, understand once for all, princeâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am to blame in this, Ganiaâ\\x80\\x94no one else,â\\x80\\x9d said Ptitsin.\\r\\n\\r\\nGania glanced inquiringly at the speaker.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s better so, you know, Ganiaâ\\x80\\x94especially as, from one point of view,\\r\\nthe matter may be considered as settled,â\\x80\\x9d said Ptitsin; and sitting\\r\\ndown a little way from the table he began to study a paper covered with\\r\\npencil writing.\\r\\n\\r\\nGania stood and frowned, he expected a family scene. He never thought\\r\\nof apologizing to the prince, however.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf itâ\\x80\\x99s all settled, Gania, then of course Mr. Ptitsin is right,â\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nNina Alexandrovna. â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t frown. You need not worry yourself, Gania; I\\r\\nshall ask you no questions. You need not tell me anything you donâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nlike. I assure you I have quite submitted to your will.â\\x80\\x9d She said all\\r\\nthis, knitting away the while as though perfectly calm and composed.\\r\\n\\r\\nGania was surprised, but cautiously kept silence and looked at his\\r\\nmother, hoping that she would express herself more clearly. Nina\\r\\nAlexandrovna observed his cautiousness and added, with a bitter smile:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are still suspicious, I see, and do not believe me; but you may be\\r\\nquite at your ease. There shall be no more tears, nor questionsâ\\x80\\x94not\\r\\nfrom my side, at all events. All I wish is that you may be happy, you\\r\\nknow that. I have submitted to my fate; but my heart will always be\\r\\nwith you, whether we remain united, or whether we part. Of course I\\r\\nonly answer for myselfâ\\x80\\x94you can hardly expect your sisterâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy sister again,â\\x80\\x9d cried Gania, looking at her with contempt and almost\\r\\nhate. â\\x80\\x9cLook here, mother, I have already given you my word that I shall\\r\\nalways respect you fully and absolutely, and so shall everyone else in\\r\\nthis house, be it who it may, who shall cross this threshold.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nGania was so much relieved that he gazed at his mother almost\\r\\naffectionately.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was not at all afraid for myself, Gania, as you know well. It was\\r\\nnot for my own sake that I have been so anxious and worried all this\\r\\ntime! They say it is all to be settled to-day. What is to be settled?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe has promised to tell me tonight at her own house whether she\\r\\nconsents or not,â\\x80\\x9d replied Gania.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe have been silent on this subject for three weeks,â\\x80\\x9d said his mother,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand it was better so; and now I will only ask you one question. How\\r\\ncan she give her consent and make you a present of her portrait when\\r\\nyou do not love her? How can such aâ\\x80\\x94such aâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPractised handâ\\x80\\x94eh?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was not going to express myself so. But how could you so blind her?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNina Alexandrovnaâ\\x80\\x99s question betrayed intense annoyance. Gania waited a\\r\\nmoment and then said, without taking the trouble to conceal the irony\\r\\nof his tone:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere you are, mother, you are always like that. You begin by\\r\\npromising that there are to be no reproaches or insinuations or\\r\\nquestions, and here you are beginning them at once. We had better drop\\r\\nthe subjectâ\\x80\\x94we had, really. I shall never leave you, mother; any other\\r\\nman would cut and run from such a sister as this. See how she is\\r\\nlooking at me at this moment! Besides, how do you know that I am\\r\\nblinding Nastasia Philipovna? As for Varia, I donâ\\x80\\x99t careâ\\x80\\x94she can do\\r\\njust as she pleases. There, thatâ\\x80\\x99s quite enough!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nGaniaâ\\x80\\x99s irritation increased with every word he uttered, as he walked\\r\\nup and down the room. These conversations always touched the family\\r\\nsores before long.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have said already that the moment she comes in I go out, and I shall\\r\\nkeep my word,â\\x80\\x9d remarked Varia.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOut of obstinacyâ\\x80\\x9d shouted Gania. â\\x80\\x9cYou havenâ\\x80\\x99t married, either, thanks\\r\\nto your obstinacy. Oh, you neednâ\\x80\\x99t frown at me, Varvara! You can go at\\r\\nonce for all I care; I am sick enough of your company. What, you are\\r\\ngoing to leave us are you, too?â\\x80\\x9d he cried, turning to the prince, who\\r\\nwas rising from his chair.\\r\\n\\r\\nGaniaâ\\x80\\x99s voice was full of the most uncontrolled and uncontrollable\\r\\nirritation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince turned at the door to say something, but perceiving in\\r\\nGaniaâ\\x80\\x99s expression that there was but that one drop wanting to make the\\r\\ncup overflow, he changed his mind and left the room without a word. A\\r\\nfew minutes later he was aware from the noisy voices in the drawing\\r\\nroom, that the conversation had become more quarrelsome than ever after\\r\\nhis departure.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe crossed the salon and the entrance-hall, so as to pass down the\\r\\ncorridor into his own room. As he came near the front door he heard\\r\\nsomeone outside vainly endeavouring to ring the bell, which was\\r\\nevidently broken, and only shook a little, without emitting any sound.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince took down the chain and opened the door. He started back in\\r\\namazementâ\\x80\\x94for there stood Nastasia Philipovna. He knew her at once from\\r\\nher photograph. Her eyes blazed with anger as she looked at him. She\\r\\nquickly pushed by him into the hall, shouldering him out of her way,\\r\\nand said, furiously, as she threw off her fur cloak:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf you are too lazy to mend your bell, you should at least wait in the\\r\\nhall to let people in when they rattle the bell handle. There, now,\\r\\nyouâ\\x80\\x99ve dropped my fur cloakâ\\x80\\x94dummy!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSure enough the cloak was lying on the ground. Nastasia had thrown it\\r\\noff her towards the prince, expecting him to catch it, but the prince\\r\\nhad missed it.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow thenâ\\x80\\x94announce me, quick!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince wanted to say something, but was so confused and astonished\\r\\nthat he could not. However, he moved off towards the drawing-room with\\r\\nthe cloak over his arm.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow then, where are you taking my cloak to? Ha, ha, ha! Are you mad?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince turned and came back, more confused than ever. When she\\r\\nburst out laughing, he smiled, but his tongue could not form a word as\\r\\nyet. At first, when he had opened the door and saw her standing before\\r\\nhim, he had become as pale as death; but now the red blood had rushed\\r\\nback to his cheeks in a torrent.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, what an idiot it is!â\\x80\\x9d cried Nastasia, stamping her foot with\\r\\nirritation. â\\x80\\x9cGo on, do! Whom are you going to announce?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNastasia Philipovna,â\\x80\\x9d murmured the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd how do you know that?â\\x80\\x9d she asked him, sharply.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have never seen you before!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGo on, announce meâ\\x80\\x94whatâ\\x80\\x99s that noise?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey are quarrelling,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, and entered the drawing-room,\\r\\njust as matters in there had almost reached a crisis. Nina Alexandrovna\\r\\nhad forgotten that she had â\\x80\\x9csubmitted to everything!â\\x80\\x9d She was defending\\r\\nVaria. Ptitsin was taking her part, too. Not that Varia was afraid of\\r\\nstanding up for herself. She was by no means that sort of a girl; but\\r\\nher brother was becoming ruder and more intolerable every moment. Her\\r\\nusual practice in such cases as the present was to say nothing, but\\r\\nstare at him, without taking her eyes off his face for an instant. This\\r\\nmanoeuvre, as she well knew, could drive Gania distracted.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust at this moment the door opened and the prince entered, announcing:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNastasia Philipovna!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIX.\\r\\n\\r\\nSilence immediately fell on the room; all looked at the prince as\\r\\nthough they neither understood, nor hoped to understand. Gania was\\r\\nmotionless with horror.\\r\\n\\r\\nNastasiaâ\\x80\\x99s arrival was a most unexpected and overwhelming event to all\\r\\nparties. In the first place, she had never been before. Up to now she\\r\\nhad been so haughty that she had never even asked Gania to introduce\\r\\nher to his parents. Of late she had not so much as mentioned them.\\r\\nGania was partly glad of this; but still he had put it to her debit in\\r\\nthe account to be settled after marriage.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe would have borne anything from her rather than this visit. But one\\r\\nthing seemed to him quite clearâ\\x80\\x94her visit now, and the present of her\\r\\nportrait on this particular day, pointed out plainly enough which way\\r\\nshe intended to make her decision!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe incredulous amazement with which all regarded the prince did not\\r\\nlast long, for Nastasia herself appeared at the door and passed in,\\r\\npushing by the prince again.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAt last Iâ\\x80\\x99ve stormed the citadel! Why do you tie up your bell?â\\x80\\x9d she\\r\\nsaid, merrily, as she pressed Ganiaâ\\x80\\x99s hand, the latter having rushed up\\r\\nto her as soon as she made her appearance. â\\x80\\x9cWhat are you looking so\\r\\nupset about? Introduce me, please!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bewildered Gania introduced her first to Varia, and both women,\\r\\nbefore shaking hands, exchanged looks of strange import. Nastasia,\\r\\nhowever, smiled amiably; but Varia did not try to look amiable, and\\r\\nkept her gloomy expression. She did not even vouchsafe the usual\\r\\ncourteous smile of etiquette. Gania darted a terrible glance of wrath\\r\\nat her for this, but Nina Alexandrovna mended matters a little when\\r\\nGania introduced her at last. Hardly, however, had the old lady begun\\r\\nabout her â\\x80\\x9chighly gratified feelings,â\\x80\\x9d and so on, when Nastasia left\\r\\nher, and flounced into a chair by Ganiaâ\\x80\\x99s side in the corner by the\\r\\nwindow, and cried: â\\x80\\x9cWhereâ\\x80\\x99s your study? and where are theâ\\x80\\x94the lodgers?\\r\\nYou do take in lodgers, donâ\\x80\\x99t you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nGania looked dreadfully put out, and tried to say something in reply,\\r\\nbut Nastasia interrupted him:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, where are you going to squeeze lodgers in here? Donâ\\x80\\x99t you use a\\r\\nstudy? Does this sort of thing pay?â\\x80\\x9d she added, turning to Nina\\r\\nAlexandrovna.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, it is troublesome, rather,â\\x80\\x9d said the latter; â\\x80\\x9cbut I suppose it\\r\\nwill â\\x80\\x98payâ\\x80\\x99 pretty well. We have only just begun, howeverâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain Nastasia Philipovna did not hear the sentence out. She glanced at\\r\\nGania, and cried, laughing, â\\x80\\x9cWhat a face! My goodness, what a face you\\r\\nhave on at this moment!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed, Gania did not look in the least like himself. His bewilderment\\r\\nand his alarmed perplexity passed off, however, and his lips now\\r\\ntwitched with rage as he continued to stare evilly at his laughing\\r\\nguest, while his countenance became absolutely livid.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was another witness, who, though standing at the door motionless\\r\\nand bewildered himself, still managed to remark Ganiaâ\\x80\\x99s death-like\\r\\npallor, and the dreadful change that had come over his face. This\\r\\nwitness was the prince, who now advanced in alarm and muttered to\\r\\nGania:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDrink some water, and donâ\\x80\\x99t look like that!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was clear that he came out with these words quite spontaneously, on\\r\\nthe spur of the moment. But his speech was productive of muchâ\\x80\\x94for it\\r\\nappeared that all Ganiaâ\\x80\\x99s rage now overflowed upon the prince. He\\r\\nseized him by the shoulder and gazed with an intensity of loathing and\\r\\nrevenge at him, but said nothingâ\\x80\\x94as though his feelings were too strong\\r\\nto permit of words.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral agitation prevailed. Nina Alexandrovna gave a little cry of\\r\\nanxiety; Ptitsin took a step forward in alarm; Colia and Ferdishenko\\r\\nstood stock still at the door in amazement;â\\x80\\x94only Varia remained coolly\\r\\nwatching the scene from under her eyelashes. She did not sit down, but\\r\\nstood by her mother with folded hands. However, Gania recollected\\r\\nhimself almost immediately. He let go of the prince and burst out\\r\\nlaughing.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, are you a doctor, prince, or what?â\\x80\\x9d he asked, as naturally as\\r\\npossible. â\\x80\\x9cI declare you quite frightened me! Nastasia Philipovna, let\\r\\nme introduce this interesting character to youâ\\x80\\x94though I have only known\\r\\nhim myself since the morning.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNastasia gazed at the prince in bewilderment. â\\x80\\x9cPrince? He a Prince?\\r\\nWhy, I took him for the footman, just now, and sent him in to announce\\r\\nme! Ha, ha, ha, isnâ\\x80\\x99t that good!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot bad that, not bad at all!â\\x80\\x9d put in Ferdishenko, â\\x80\\x9c_se non Ã¨ vero_â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI rather think I pitched into you, too, didnâ\\x80\\x99t I? Forgive meâ\\x80\\x94do! Who\\r\\nis he, did you say? What prince? Muishkin?â\\x80\\x9d she added, addressing\\r\\nGania.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe is a lodger of ours,â\\x80\\x9d explained the latter.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAn idiot!â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94the prince distinctly heard the word half whispered from\\r\\nbehind him. This was Ferdishenkoâ\\x80\\x99s voluntary information for Nastasiaâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nbenefit.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTell me, why didnâ\\x80\\x99t you put me right when I made such a dreadful\\r\\nmistake just now?â\\x80\\x9d continued the latter, examining the prince from head\\r\\nto foot without the slightest ceremony. She awaited the answer as\\r\\nthough convinced that it would be so foolish that she must inevitably\\r\\nfail to restrain her laughter over it.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was astonished, seeing you so suddenlyâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d murmured the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow did you know who I was? Where had you seen me before? And why were\\r\\nyou so struck dumb at the sight of me? What was there so overwhelming\\r\\nabout me?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOho! ho, ho, ho!â\\x80\\x9d cried Ferdishenko. â\\x80\\x9c_Now_ then, prince! My word,\\r\\nwhat things I would say if I had such a chance as that! My goodness,\\r\\nprinceâ\\x80\\x94go on!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo should I, in your place, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve no doubt!â\\x80\\x9d laughed the prince to\\r\\nFerdishenko; then continued, addressing Nastasia: â\\x80\\x9cYour portrait struck\\r\\nme very forcibly this morning; then I was talking about you to the\\r\\nEpanchins; and then, in the train, before I reached Petersburg, Parfen\\r\\nRogojin told me a good deal about you; and at the very moment that I\\r\\nopened the door to you I happened to be thinking of you, whenâ\\x80\\x94there you\\r\\nstood before me!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd how did you recognize me?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFrom the portrait!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat else?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI seemed to imagine you exactly as you areâ\\x80\\x94I seemed to have seen you\\r\\nsomewhere.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhereâ\\x80\\x94where?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI seem to have seen your eyes somewhere; but it cannot be! I have not\\r\\nseen youâ\\x80\\x94I never was here before. I may have dreamed of you, I donâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nknow.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince said all this with manifest effortâ\\x80\\x94in broken sentences, and\\r\\nwith many drawings of breath. He was evidently much agitated. Nastasia\\r\\nPhilipovna looked at him inquisitively, but did not laugh.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBravo, prince!â\\x80\\x9d cried Ferdishenko, delighted.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this moment a loud voice from behind the group which hedged in the\\r\\nprince and Nastasia Philipovna, divided the crowd, as it were, and\\r\\nbefore them stood the head of the family, General Ivolgin. He was\\r\\ndressed in evening clothes; his moustache was dyed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis apparition was too much for Gania. Vain and ambitious almost to\\r\\nmorbidness, he had had much to put up with in the last two months, and\\r\\nwas seeking feverishly for some means of enabling himself to lead a\\r\\nmore presentable kind of existence. At home, he now adopted an attitude\\r\\nof absolute cynicism, but he could not keep this up before Nastasia\\r\\nPhilipovna, although he had sworn to make her pay after marriage for\\r\\nall he suffered now. He was experiencing a last humiliation, the\\r\\nbitterest of all, at this momentâ\\x80\\x94the humiliation of blushing for his\\r\\nown kindred in his own house. A question flashed through his mind as to\\r\\nwhether the game was really worth the candle.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor that had happened at this moment, which for two months had been his\\r\\nnightmare; which had filled his soul with dread and shameâ\\x80\\x94the meeting\\r\\nbetween his father and Nastasia Philipovna. He had often tried to\\r\\nimagine such an event, but had found the picture too mortifying and\\r\\nexasperating, and had quietly dropped it. Very likely he anticipated\\r\\nfar worse things than was at all necessary; it is often so with vain\\r\\npersons. He had long since determined, therefore, to get his father out\\r\\nof the way, anywhere, before his marriage, in order to avoid such a\\r\\nmeeting; but when Nastasia entered the room just now, he had been so\\r\\noverwhelmed with astonishment, that he had not thought of his father,\\r\\nand had made no arrangements to keep him out of the way. And now it was\\r\\ntoo lateâ\\x80\\x94there he was, and got up, too, in a dress coat and white tie,\\r\\nand Nastasia in the very humour to heap ridicule on him and his family\\r\\ncircle; of this last fact, he felt quite persuaded. What else had she\\r\\ncome for? There were his mother and his sister sitting before her, and\\r\\nshe seemed to have forgotten their very existence already; and if she\\r\\nbehaved like that, he thought, she must have some object in view.\\r\\n\\r\\nFerdishenko led the general up to Nastasia Philipovna.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cArdalion Alexandrovitch Ivolgin,â\\x80\\x9d said the smiling general, with a low\\r\\nbow of great dignity, â\\x80\\x9can old soldier, unfortunate, and the father of\\r\\nthis family; but happy in the hope of including in that family so\\r\\nexquisiteâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did not finish his sentence, for at this moment Ferdishenko pushed a\\r\\nchair up from behind, and the general, not very firm on his legs, at\\r\\nthis post-prandial hour, flopped into it backwards. It was always a\\r\\ndifficult thing to put this warrior to confusion, and his sudden\\r\\ndescent left him as composed as before. He had sat down just opposite\\r\\nto Nastasia, whose fingers he now took, and raised to his lips with\\r\\ngreat elegance, and much courtesy. The general had once belonged to a\\r\\nvery select circle of society, but he had been turned out of it two or\\r\\nthree years since on account of certain weaknesses, in which he now\\r\\nindulged with all the less restraint; but his good manners remained\\r\\nwith him to this day, in spite of all.\\r\\n\\r\\nNastasia Philipovna seemed delighted at the appearance of this latest\\r\\narrival, of whom she had of course heard a good deal by report.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have heard that my sonâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d began Ardalion Alexandrovitch.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYour son, indeed! A nice papa you are! _You_ might have come to see me\\r\\nanyhow, without compromising anyone. Do you hide yourself, or does your\\r\\nson hide you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe children of the nineteenth century, and their parentsâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d began the\\r\\ngeneral, again.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNastasia Philipovna, will you excuse the general for a moment? Someone\\r\\nis inquiring for him,â\\x80\\x9d said Nina Alexandrovna in a loud voice,\\r\\ninterrupting the conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExcuse him? Oh no, I have wished to see him too long for that. Why,\\r\\nwhat business can he have? He has retired, hasnâ\\x80\\x99t he? You wonâ\\x80\\x99t leave\\r\\nme, general, will you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI give you my word that he shall come and see youâ\\x80\\x94but heâ\\x80\\x94he needs rest\\r\\njust now.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGeneral, they say you require rest,â\\x80\\x9d said Nastasia Philipovna, with\\r\\nthe melancholy face of a child whose toy is taken away.\\r\\n\\r\\nArdalion Alexandrovitch immediately did his best to make his foolish\\r\\nposition a great deal worse.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear, my dear!â\\x80\\x9d he said, solemnly and reproachfully, looking at his\\r\\nwife, with one hand on his heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWonâ\\x80\\x99t you leave the room, mamma?â\\x80\\x9d asked Varia, aloud.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, Varia, I shall sit it out to the end.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNastasia must have overheard both question and reply, but her vivacity\\r\\nwas not in the least damped. On the contrary, it seemed to increase.\\r\\nShe immediately overwhelmed the general once more with questions, and\\r\\nwithin five minutes that gentleman was as happy as a king, and holding\\r\\nforth at the top of his voice, amid the laughter of almost all who\\r\\nheard him.\\r\\n\\r\\nColia jogged the princeâ\\x80\\x99s arm.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCanâ\\x80\\x99t _you_ get him out of the room, somehow? _Do_, please,â\\x80\\x9d and tears\\r\\nof annoyance stood in the boyâ\\x80\\x99s eyes. â\\x80\\x9cCurse that Gania!â\\x80\\x9d he muttered,\\r\\nbetween his teeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh yes, I knew General Epanchin well,â\\x80\\x9d General Ivolgin was saying at\\r\\nthis moment; â\\x80\\x9che and Prince Nicolai Ivanovitch Muishkinâ\\x80\\x94whose son I\\r\\nhave this day embraced after an absence of twenty yearsâ\\x80\\x94and I, were\\r\\nthree inseparables. Alas one is in the grave, torn to pieces by\\r\\ncalumnies and bullets; another is now before you, still battling with\\r\\ncalumnies and bulletsâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBullets?â\\x80\\x9d cried Nastasia.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, here in my chest. I received them at the siege of Kars, and I\\r\\nfeel them in bad weather now. And as to the third of our trio,\\r\\nEpanchin, of course after that little affair with the poodle in the\\r\\nrailway carriage, it was all _up_ between us.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPoodle? What was that? And in a railway carriage? Dear me,â\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nNastasia, thoughtfully, as though trying to recall something to mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, just a silly, little occurrence, really not worth telling, about\\r\\nPrincess Bielokonskiâ\\x80\\x99s governess, Miss Smith, andâ\\x80\\x94oh, it is really not\\r\\nworth telling!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, no, we must have it!â\\x80\\x9d cried Nastasia merrily.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, of course,â\\x80\\x9d said Ferdishenko. â\\x80\\x9cCâ\\x80\\x99est du nouveau.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cArdalion,â\\x80\\x9d said Nina Alexandrovitch, entreatingly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPapa, you are wanted!â\\x80\\x9d cried Colia.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, it is a silly little story, in a few words,â\\x80\\x9d began the delighted\\r\\ngeneral. â\\x80\\x9cA couple of years ago, soon after the new railway was opened,\\r\\nI had to go somewhere or other on business. Well, I took a first-class\\r\\nticket, sat down, and began to smoke, or rather _continued_ to smoke,\\r\\nfor I had lighted up before. I was alone in the carriage. Smoking is\\r\\nnot allowed, but is not prohibited either; it is half allowedâ\\x80\\x94so to\\r\\nspeak, winked at. I had the window open.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSuddenly, just before the whistle, in came two ladies with a little\\r\\npoodle, and sat down opposite to me; not bad-looking women; one was in\\r\\nlight blue, the other in black silk. The poodle, a beauty with a silver\\r\\ncollar, lay on light blueâ\\x80\\x99s knee. They looked haughtily about, and\\r\\ntalked English together. I took no notice, just went on smoking. I\\r\\nobserved that the ladies were getting angryâ\\x80\\x94over my cigar, doubtless.\\r\\nOne looked at me through her tortoise-shell eyeglass.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI took no notice, because they never said a word. If they didnâ\\x80\\x99t like\\r\\nthe cigar, why couldnâ\\x80\\x99t they say so? Not a word, not a hint! Suddenly,\\r\\nand without the very slightest suspicion of warning, â\\x80\\x98light blueâ\\x80\\x99\\r\\nseizes my cigar from between my fingers, and, wheugh! out of the window\\r\\nwith it! Well, on flew the train, and I sat bewildered, and the young\\r\\nwoman, tall and fair, and rather red in the face, too red, glared at me\\r\\nwith flashing eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI didnâ\\x80\\x99t say a word, but with extreme courtesy, I may say with most\\r\\nrefined courtesy, I reached my finger and thumb over towards the\\r\\npoodle, took it up delicately by the nape of the neck, and chucked it\\r\\nout of the window, after the cigar. The train went flying on, and the\\r\\npoodleâ\\x80\\x99s yells were lost in the distance.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, you naughty man!â\\x80\\x9d cried Nastasia, laughing and clapping her hands\\r\\nlike a child.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBravo!â\\x80\\x9d said Ferdishenko. Ptitsin laughed too, though he had been very\\r\\nsorry to see the general appear. Even Colia laughed and said, â\\x80\\x9cBravo!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd I was right, truly right,â\\x80\\x9d cried the general, with warmth and\\r\\nsolemnity, â\\x80\\x9cfor if cigars are forbidden in railway carriages, poodles\\r\\nare much more so.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, and what did the lady do?â\\x80\\x9d asked Nastasia, impatiently.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSheâ\\x80\\x94ah, thatâ\\x80\\x99s where all the mischief of it lies!â\\x80\\x9d replied Ivolgin,\\r\\nfrowning. â\\x80\\x9cWithout a word, as it were, of warning, she slapped me on\\r\\nthe cheek! An extraordinary woman!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general dropped his eyes, and elevated his brows; shrugged his\\r\\nshoulders, tightened his lips, spread his hands, and remained silent.\\r\\nAt last he blurted out:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI lost my head!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDid you hit her?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, oh no!â\\x80\\x94there was a great flare-up, but I didnâ\\x80\\x99t hit her! I had to\\r\\nstruggle a little, purely to defend myself; but the very devil was in\\r\\nthe business. It turned out that â\\x80\\x98light blueâ\\x80\\x99 was an Englishwoman,\\r\\ngoverness or something, at Princess Bielokonskiâ\\x80\\x99s, and the other woman\\r\\nwas one of the old-maid princesses Bielokonski. Well, everybody knows\\r\\nwhat great friends the princess and Mrs. Epanchin are, so there was a\\r\\npretty kettle of fish. All the Bielokonskis went into mourning for the\\r\\npoodle. Six princesses in tears, and the Englishwoman shrieking!\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course I wrote an apology, and called, but they would not receive\\r\\neither me or my apology, and the Epanchins cut me, too!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut wait,â\\x80\\x9d said Nastasia. â\\x80\\x9cHow is it that, five or six days since, I\\r\\nread exactly the same story in the paper, as happening between a\\r\\nFrenchman and an English girl? The cigar was snatched away exactly as\\r\\nyou describe, and the poodle was chucked out of the window after it.\\r\\nThe slapping came off, too, as in your case; and the girlâ\\x80\\x99s dress was\\r\\nlight blue!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general blushed dreadfully; Colia blushed too; and Ptitsin turned\\r\\nhastily away. Ferdishenko was the only one who laughed as gaily as\\r\\nbefore. As to Gania, I need not say that he was miserable; he stood\\r\\ndumb and wretched and took no notice of anybody.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI assure you,â\\x80\\x9d said the general, â\\x80\\x9cthat exactly the same thing happened\\r\\nto myself!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI remembered there was some quarrel between father and Miss Smith, the\\r\\nBielokonskiâ\\x80\\x99s governess,â\\x80\\x9d said Colia.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow very curious, point for point the same anecdote, and happening at\\r\\ndifferent ends of Europe! Even the light blue dress the same,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\ncontinued the pitiless Nastasia. â\\x80\\x9cI must really send you the paper.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou must observe,â\\x80\\x9d insisted the general, â\\x80\\x9cthat my experience was two\\r\\nyears earlier.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh! thatâ\\x80\\x99s it, no doubt!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNastasia Philipovna laughed hysterically.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFather, will you hear a word from me outside!â\\x80\\x9d said Gania, his voice\\r\\nshaking with agitation, as he seized his father by the shoulder. His\\r\\neyes shone with a blaze of hatred.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this moment there was a terrific bang at the front door, almost\\r\\nenough to break it down. Some most unusual visitor must have arrived.\\r\\nColia ran to open.\\r\\n\\r\\nX.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe entrance-hall suddenly became full of noise and people. To judge\\r\\nfrom the sounds which penetrated to the drawing-room, a number of\\r\\npeople had already come in, and the stampede continued. Several voices\\r\\nwere talking and shouting at once; others were talking and shouting on\\r\\nthe stairs outside; it was evidently a most extraordinary visit that\\r\\nwas about to take place.\\r\\n\\r\\nEveryone exchanged startled glances. Gania rushed out towards the\\r\\ndining-room, but a number of men had already made their way in, and met\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh! here he is, the Judas!â\\x80\\x9d cried a voice which the prince recognized\\r\\nat once. â\\x80\\x9cHow dâ\\x80\\x99ye do, Gania, you old blackguard?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, thatâ\\x80\\x99s the man!â\\x80\\x9d said another voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no room for doubt in the princeâ\\x80\\x99s mind: one of the voices was\\r\\nRogojinâ\\x80\\x99s, and the other Lebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s.\\r\\n\\r\\nGania stood at the door like a block and looked on in silence, putting\\r\\nno obstacle in the way of their entrance, and ten or a dozen men\\r\\nmarched in behind Parfen Rogojin. They were a decidedly mixed-looking\\r\\ncollection, and some of them came in in their furs and caps. None of\\r\\nthem were quite drunk, but all appeared to be considerably excited.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey seemed to need each otherâ\\x80\\x99s support, morally, before they dared\\r\\ncome in; not one of them would have entered alone but with the rest\\r\\neach one was brave enough. Even Rogojin entered rather cautiously at\\r\\nthe head of his troop; but he was evidently preoccupied. He appeared to\\r\\nbe gloomy and morose, and had clearly come with some end in view. All\\r\\nthe rest were merely chorus, brought in to support the chief character.\\r\\nBesides Lebedeff there was the dandy Zalesheff, who came in without his\\r\\ncoat and hat, two or three others followed his example; the rest were\\r\\nmore uncouth. They included a couple of young merchants, a man in a\\r\\ngreat-coat, a medical student, a little Pole, a small fat man who\\r\\nlaughed continuously, and an enormously tall stout one who apparently\\r\\nput great faith in the strength of his fists. A couple of â\\x80\\x9cladiesâ\\x80\\x9d of\\r\\nsome sort put their heads in at the front door, but did not dare come\\r\\nany farther. Colia promptly banged the door in their faces and locked\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHallo, Gania, you blackguard! You didnâ\\x80\\x99t expect Rogojin, eh?â\\x80\\x9d said the\\r\\nlatter, entering the drawing-room, and stopping before Gania.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut at this moment he saw, seated before him, Nastasia Philipovna. He\\r\\nhad not dreamed of meeting her here, evidently, for her appearance\\r\\nproduced a marvellous effect upon him. He grew pale, and his lips\\r\\nbecame actually blue.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI suppose it is true, then!â\\x80\\x9d he muttered to himself, and his face took\\r\\non an expression of despair. â\\x80\\x9cSo thatâ\\x80\\x99s the end of it! Now you, sir,\\r\\nwill you answer me or not?â\\x80\\x9d he went on suddenly, gazing at Gania with\\r\\nineffable malice. â\\x80\\x9cNow then, youâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe panted, and could hardly speak for agitation. He advanced into the\\r\\nroom mechanically; but perceiving Nina Alexandrovna and Varia he became\\r\\nmore or less embarrassed, in spite of his excitement. His followers\\r\\nentered after him, and all paused a moment at sight of the ladies. Of\\r\\ncourse their modesty was not fated to be long-lived, but for a moment\\r\\nthey were abashed. Once let them begin to shout, however, and nothing\\r\\non earth should disconcert them.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat, you here too, prince?â\\x80\\x9d said Rogojin, absently, but a little\\r\\nsurprised all the same â\\x80\\x9cStill in your gaiters, eh?â\\x80\\x9d He sighed, and\\r\\nforgot the prince next moment, and his wild eyes wandered over to\\r\\nNastasia again, as though attracted in that direction by some magnetic\\r\\nforce.\\r\\n\\r\\nNastasia looked at the new arrivals with great curiosity. Gania\\r\\nrecollected himself at last.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExcuse me, sirs,â\\x80\\x9d he said, loudly, â\\x80\\x9cbut what does all this mean?â\\x80\\x9d He\\r\\nglared at the advancing crowd generally, but addressed his remarks\\r\\nespecially to their captain, Rogojin. â\\x80\\x9cYou are not in a stable,\\r\\ngentlemen, though you may think itâ\\x80\\x94my mother and sister are present.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I see your mother and sister,â\\x80\\x9d muttered Rogojin, through his\\r\\nteeth; and Lebedeff seemed to feel himself called upon to second the\\r\\nstatement.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAt all events, I must request you to step into the salon,â\\x80\\x9d said Gania,\\r\\nhis rage rising quite out of proportion to his words, â\\x80\\x9cand then I shall\\r\\ninquireâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat, he doesnâ\\x80\\x99t know me!â\\x80\\x9d said Rogojin, showing his teeth\\r\\ndisagreeably. â\\x80\\x9cHe doesnâ\\x80\\x99t recognize Rogojin!â\\x80\\x9d He did not move an inch,\\r\\nhowever.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have met you somewhere, I believe, butâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMet me somewhere, pfu! Why, itâ\\x80\\x99s only three months since I lost two\\r\\nhundred roubles of my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s money to you, at cards. The old fellow\\r\\ndied before he found out. Ptitsin knows all about it. Why, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve only to\\r\\npull out a three-rouble note and show it to you, and youâ\\x80\\x99d crawl on\\r\\nyour hands and knees to the other end of the town for it; thatâ\\x80\\x99s the\\r\\nsort of man you are. Why, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve come now, at this moment, to buy you up!\\r\\nOh, you neednâ\\x80\\x99t think that because I wear these boots I have no money.\\r\\nI have lots of money, my beauty,â\\x80\\x94enough to buy up you and all yours\\r\\ntogether. So I shall, if I like to! Iâ\\x80\\x99ll buy you up! I will!â\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nyelled, apparently growing more and more intoxicated and excited. â\\x80\\x9cOh,\\r\\nNastasia Philipovna! donâ\\x80\\x99t turn me out! Say one word, do! Are you going\\r\\nto marry this man, or not?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRogojin asked his question like a lost soul appealing to some divinity,\\r\\nwith the reckless daring of one appointed to die, who has nothing to\\r\\nlose.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe awaited the reply in deadly anxiety.\\r\\n\\r\\nNastasia Philipovna gazed at him with a haughty, ironical expression of\\r\\nface; but when she glanced at Nina Alexandrovna and Varia, and from\\r\\nthem to Gania, she changed her tone, all of a sudden.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly not; what are you thinking of? What could have induced you\\r\\nto ask such a question?â\\x80\\x9d she replied, quietly and seriously, and even,\\r\\napparently, with some astonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo? No?â\\x80\\x9d shouted Rogojin, almost out of his mind with joy. â\\x80\\x9cYou are\\r\\nnot going to, after all? And they told meâ\\x80\\x94oh, Nastasia Philipovnaâ\\x80\\x94they\\r\\nsaid you had promised to marry him, _him!_ As if you _could_ do\\r\\nit!â\\x80\\x94himâ\\x80\\x94pooh! I donâ\\x80\\x99t mind saying it to everyoneâ\\x80\\x94Iâ\\x80\\x99d buy him off for a\\r\\nhundred roubles, any day pfu! Give him a thousand, or three if he\\r\\nlikes, poor devil, and heâ\\x80\\x99d cut and run the day before his wedding, and\\r\\nleave his bride to me! Wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t you, Gania, you blackguard? Youâ\\x80\\x99d take\\r\\nthree thousand, wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t you? Hereâ\\x80\\x99s the money! Look, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve come on\\r\\npurpose to pay you off and get your receipt, formally. I said Iâ\\x80\\x99d buy\\r\\nyou up, and so I will.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGet out of this, you drunken beast!â\\x80\\x9d cried Gania, who was red and\\r\\nwhite by turns.\\r\\n\\r\\nRogojinâ\\x80\\x99s troop, who were only waiting for an excuse, set up a howl at\\r\\nthis. Lebedeff stepped forward and whispered something in Parfenâ\\x80\\x99s ear.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re right, clerk,â\\x80\\x9d said the latter, â\\x80\\x9cyouâ\\x80\\x99re right, tipsy\\r\\nspiritâ\\x80\\x94youâ\\x80\\x99re right!â\\x80\\x94Nastasia Philipovna,â\\x80\\x9d he added, looking at her\\r\\nlike some lunatic, harmless generally, but suddenly wound up to a pitch\\r\\nof audacity, â\\x80\\x9chere are eighteen thousand roubles, andâ\\x80\\x94and you shall\\r\\nhave moreâ\\x80\\x94.â\\x80\\x9d Here he threw a packet of bank-notes tied up in white\\r\\npaper, on the table before her, not daring to say all he wished to say.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNoâ\\x80\\x94noâ\\x80\\x94no!â\\x80\\x9d muttered Lebedeff, clutching at his arm. He was clearly\\r\\naghast at the largeness of the sum, and thought a far smaller amount\\r\\nshould have been tried first.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, you foolâ\\x80\\x94you donâ\\x80\\x99t know whom you are dealing withâ\\x80\\x94and it appears I\\r\\nam a fool, too!â\\x80\\x9d said Parfen, trembling beneath the flashing glance of\\r\\nNastasia. â\\x80\\x9cOh, curse it all! What a fool I was to listen to you!â\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nadded, with profound melancholy.\\r\\n\\r\\nNastasia Philipovna, observing his woe-begone expression, suddenly\\r\\nburst out laughing.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEighteen thousand roubles, for me? Why, you declare yourself a fool at\\r\\nonce,â\\x80\\x9d she said, with impudent familiarity, as she rose from the sofa\\r\\nand prepared to go. Gania watched the whole scene with a sinking of the\\r\\nheart.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cForty thousand, thenâ\\x80\\x94forty thousand roubles instead of eighteen!\\r\\nPtitsin and another have promised to find me forty thousand roubles by\\r\\nseven oâ\\x80\\x99clock tonight. Forty thousand roublesâ\\x80\\x94paid down on the nail!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe scene was growing more and more disgraceful; but Nastasia\\r\\nPhilipovna continued to laugh and did not go away. Nina Alexandrovna\\r\\nand Varia had both risen from their places and were waiting, in silent\\r\\nhorror, to see what would happen. Variaâ\\x80\\x99s eyes were all ablaze with\\r\\nanger; but the scene had a different effect on Nina Alexandrovna. She\\r\\npaled and trembled, and looked more and more like fainting every\\r\\nmoment.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery well then, a _hundred_ thousand! a hundred thousand! paid this\\r\\nvery day. Ptitsin! find it for me. A good share shall stick to your\\r\\nfingersâ\\x80\\x94come!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are mad!â\\x80\\x9d said Ptitsin, coming up quickly and seizing him by the\\r\\nhand. â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re drunkâ\\x80\\x94the police will be sent for if you donâ\\x80\\x99t look out.\\r\\nThink where you are.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, heâ\\x80\\x99s boasting like a drunkard,â\\x80\\x9d added Nastasia, as though with\\r\\nthe sole intention of goading him.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI do _not_ boast! You shall have a hundred thousand, this very day.\\r\\nPtitsin, get the money, you gay usurer! Take what you like for it, but\\r\\nget it by the evening! Iâ\\x80\\x99ll show that Iâ\\x80\\x99m in earnest!â\\x80\\x9d cried Rogojin,\\r\\nworking himself up into a frenzy of excitement.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome, come; whatâ\\x80\\x99s all this?â\\x80\\x9d cried General Ivolgin, suddenly and\\r\\nangrily, coming close up to Rogojin. The unexpectedness of this sally\\r\\non the part of the hitherto silent old man caused some laughter among\\r\\nthe intruders.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHalloa! whatâ\\x80\\x99s this now?â\\x80\\x9d laughed Rogojin. â\\x80\\x9cYou come along with me,\\r\\nold fellow! You shall have as much to drink as you like.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, itâ\\x80\\x99s too horrible!â\\x80\\x9d cried poor Colia, sobbing with shame and\\r\\nannoyance.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSurely there must be someone among all of you here who will turn this\\r\\nshameless creature out of the room?â\\x80\\x9d cried Varia, suddenly. She was\\r\\nshaking and trembling with rage.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s me, I suppose. Iâ\\x80\\x99m the shameless creature!â\\x80\\x9d cried Nastasia\\r\\nPhilipovna, with amused indifference. â\\x80\\x9cDear me, and I cameâ\\x80\\x94like a fool,\\r\\nas I amâ\\x80\\x94to invite them over to my house for the evening! Look how your\\r\\nsister treats me, Gavrila Ardalionovitch.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some moments Gania stood as if stunned or struck by lightning,\\r\\nafter his sisterâ\\x80\\x99s speech. But seeing that Nastasia Philipovna was\\r\\nreally about to leave the room this time, he sprang at Varia and seized\\r\\nher by the arm like a madman.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat have you done?â\\x80\\x9d he hissed, glaring at her as though he would like\\r\\nto annihilate her on the spot. He was quite beside himself, and could\\r\\nhardly articulate his words for rage.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat have I done? Where are you dragging me to?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you wish me to beg pardon of this creature because she has come\\r\\nhere to insult our mother and disgrace the whole household, you low,\\r\\nbase wretch?â\\x80\\x9d cried Varia, looking back at her brother with proud\\r\\ndefiance.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few moments passed as they stood there face to face, Gania still\\r\\nholding her wrist tightly. Varia struggled onceâ\\x80\\x94twiceâ\\x80\\x94to get free; then\\r\\ncould restrain herself no longer, and spat in his face.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s a girl for you!â\\x80\\x9d cried Nastasia Philipovna. â\\x80\\x9cMr. Ptitsin, I\\r\\ncongratulate you on your choice.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nGania lost his head. Forgetful of everything he aimed a blow at Varia,\\r\\nwhich would inevitably have laid her low, but suddenly another hand\\r\\ncaught his. Between him and Varia stood the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEnoughâ\\x80\\x94enough!â\\x80\\x9d said the latter, with insistence, but all of a tremble\\r\\nwith excitement.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAre you going to cross my path for ever, damn you!â\\x80\\x9d cried Gania; and,\\r\\nloosening his hold on Varia, he slapped the princeâ\\x80\\x99s face with all his\\r\\nforce.\\r\\n\\r\\nExclamations of horror arose on all sides. The prince grew pale as\\r\\ndeath; he gazed into Ganiaâ\\x80\\x99s eyes with a strange, wild, reproachful\\r\\nlook; his lips trembled and vainly endeavoured to form some words; then\\r\\nhis mouth twisted into an incongruous smile.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery wellâ\\x80\\x94never mind about me; but I shall not allow you to strike\\r\\nher!â\\x80\\x9d he said, at last, quietly. Then, suddenly, he could bear it no\\r\\nlonger, and covering his face with his hands, turned to the wall, and\\r\\nmurmured in broken accents:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh! how ashamed you will be of this afterwards!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nGania certainly did look dreadfully abashed. Colia rushed up to comfort\\r\\nthe prince, and after him crowded Varia, Rogojin and all, even the\\r\\ngeneral.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s nothing, itâ\\x80\\x99s nothing!â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, and again he wore the\\r\\nsmile which was so inconsistent with the circumstances.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, he will be ashamed!â\\x80\\x9d cried Rogojin. â\\x80\\x9cYou will be properly ashamed\\r\\nof yourself for having injured such aâ\\x80\\x94such a sheepâ\\x80\\x9d (he could not find\\r\\na better word). â\\x80\\x9cPrince, my dear fellow, leave this and come away with\\r\\nme. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll show you how Rogojin shows his affection for his friends.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNastasia Philipovna was also much impressed, both with Ganiaâ\\x80\\x99s action\\r\\nand with the princeâ\\x80\\x99s reply.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer usually thoughtful, pale face, which all this while had been so\\r\\nlittle in harmony with the jests and laughter which she had seemed to\\r\\nput on for the occasion, was now evidently agitated by new feelings,\\r\\nthough she tried to conceal the fact and to look as though she were as\\r\\nready as ever for jesting and irony.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI really think I must have seen him somewhere!â\\x80\\x9d she murmured seriously\\r\\nenough.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, arenâ\\x80\\x99t you ashamed of yourselfâ\\x80\\x94arenâ\\x80\\x99t you ashamed? Are you really\\r\\nthe sort of woman you are trying to represent yourself to be? Is it\\r\\npossible?â\\x80\\x9d The prince was now addressing Nastasia, in a tone of\\r\\nreproach, which evidently came from his very heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nNastasia Philipovna looked surprised, and smiled, but evidently\\r\\nconcealed something beneath her smile and with some confusion and a\\r\\nglance at Gania she left the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, she had not reached the outer hall when she turned round,\\r\\nwalked quickly up to Nina Alexandrovna, seized her hand and lifted it\\r\\nto her lips.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe guessed quite right. I am not that sort of woman,â\\x80\\x9d she whispered\\r\\nhurriedly, flushing red all over. Then she turned again and left the\\r\\nroom so quickly that no one could imagine what she had come back for.\\r\\nAll they saw was that she said something to Nina Alexandrovna in a\\r\\nhurried whisper, and seemed to kiss her hand. Varia, however, both saw\\r\\nand heard all, and watched Nastasia out of the room with an expression\\r\\nof wonder.\\r\\n\\r\\nGania recollected himself in time to rush after her in order to show\\r\\nher out, but she had gone. He followed her to the stairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t come with me,â\\x80\\x9d she cried, â\\x80\\x9c_Au revoir_, till the eveningâ\\x80\\x94do you\\r\\nhear? _Au revoir!_â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe returned thoughtful and confused; the riddle lay heavier than ever\\r\\non his soul. He was troubled about the prince, too, and so bewildered\\r\\nthat he did not even observe Rogojinâ\\x80\\x99s rowdy band crowd past him and\\r\\nstep on his toes, at the door as they went out. They were all talking\\r\\nat once. Rogojin went ahead of the others, talking to Ptitsin, and\\r\\napparently insisting vehemently upon something very important.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ve lost the game, Ganiaâ\\x80\\x9d he cried, as he passed the latter.\\r\\n\\r\\nGania gazed after him uneasily, but said nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nXI.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince now left the room and shut himself up in his own chamber.\\r\\nColia followed him almost at once, anxious to do what he could to\\r\\nconsole him. The poor boy seemed to be already so attached to him that\\r\\nhe could hardly leave him.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou were quite right to go away!â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cThe row will rage there\\r\\nworse than ever now; and itâ\\x80\\x99s like this every day with usâ\\x80\\x94and all\\r\\nthrough that Nastasia Philipovna.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have so many sources of trouble here, Colia,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, indeed, and it is all our own fault. But I have a great friend\\r\\nwho is much worse off even than we are. Would you like to know him?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, very much. Is he one of your school-fellows?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, not exactly. I will tell you all about him some day.... What do\\r\\nyou think of Nastasia Philipovna? She is beautiful, isnâ\\x80\\x99t she? I had\\r\\nnever seen her before, though I had a great wish to do so. She\\r\\nfascinated me. I could forgive Gania if he were to marry her for love,\\r\\nbut for money! Oh dear! that is horrible!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, your brother does not attract me much.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am not surprised at that. After what you... But I do hate that way\\r\\nof looking at things! Because some fool, or a rogue pretending to be a\\r\\nfool, strikes a man, that man is to be dishonoured for his whole life,\\r\\nunless he wipes out the disgrace with blood, or makes his assailant beg\\r\\nforgiveness on his knees! I think that so very absurd and tyrannical.\\r\\nLermontoffâ\\x80\\x99s Bal Masque is based on that ideaâ\\x80\\x94a stupid and unnatural\\r\\none, in my opinion; but he was hardly more than a child when he wrote\\r\\nit.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI like your sister very much.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDid you see how she spat in Ganiaâ\\x80\\x99s face! Varia is afraid of no one.\\r\\nBut you did not follow her example, and yet I am sure it was not\\r\\nthrough cowardice. Here she comes! Speak of a wolf and you see his\\r\\ntail! I felt sure that she would come. She is very generous, though of\\r\\ncourse she has her faults.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nVaria pounced upon her brother.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis is not the place for you,â\\x80\\x9d said she. â\\x80\\x9cGo to father. Is he\\r\\nplaguing you, prince?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot in the least; on the contrary, he interests me.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cScolding as usual, Varia! It is the worst thing about her. After all,\\r\\nI believe father may have started off with Rogojin. No doubt he is\\r\\nsorry now. Perhaps I had better go and see what he is doing,â\\x80\\x9d added\\r\\nColia, running off.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank God, I have got mother away, and put her to bed without another\\r\\nscene! Gania is worriedâ\\x80\\x94and ashamedâ\\x80\\x94not without reason! What a\\r\\nspectacle! I have come to thank you once more, prince, and to ask you\\r\\nif you knew Nastasia Philipovna before?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I have never known her.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen what did you mean, when you said straight out to her that she was\\r\\nnot really â\\x80\\x98like thatâ\\x80\\x99? You guessed right, I fancy. It is quite\\r\\npossible she was not herself at the moment, though I cannot fathom her\\r\\nmeaning. Evidently she meant to hurt and insult us. I have heard\\r\\ncurious tales about her before now, but if she came to invite us to her\\r\\nhouse, why did she behave so to my mother? Ptitsin knows her very well;\\r\\nhe says he could not understand her today. With Rogojin, too! No one\\r\\nwith a spark of self-respect could have talked like that in the house\\r\\nof her... Mother is extremely vexed on your account, too...\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is nothing!â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, waving his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut how meek she was when you spoke to her!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMeek! What do you mean?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou told her it was a shame for her to behave so, and her manner\\r\\nchanged at once; she was like another person. You have some influence\\r\\nover her, prince,â\\x80\\x9d added Varia, smiling a little.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe door opened at this point, and in came Gania most unexpectedly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was not in the least disconcerted to see Varia there, but he stood a\\r\\nmoment at the door, and then approached the prince quietly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPrince,â\\x80\\x9d he said, with feeling, â\\x80\\x9cI was a blackguard. Forgive me!â\\x80\\x9d His\\r\\nface gave evidence of suffering. The prince was considerably amazed,\\r\\nand did not reply at once. â\\x80\\x9cOh, come, forgive me, forgive me!â\\x80\\x9d Gania\\r\\ninsisted, rather impatiently. â\\x80\\x9cIf you like, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll kiss your hand.\\r\\nThere!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince was touched; he took Ganiaâ\\x80\\x99s hands, and embraced him\\r\\nheartily, while each kissed the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI never, never thought you were like that,â\\x80\\x9d said Muishkin, drawing a\\r\\ndeep breath. â\\x80\\x9cI thought youâ\\x80\\x94you werenâ\\x80\\x99t capable ofâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf what? Apologizing, eh? And where on earth did I get the idea that\\r\\nyou were an idiot? You always observe what other people pass by\\r\\nunnoticed; one could talk sense to you, butâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHere is another to whom you should apologize,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince,\\r\\npointing to Varia.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, no! they are all enemies! Iâ\\x80\\x99ve tried them often enough, believe\\r\\nme,â\\x80\\x9d and Gania turned his back on Varia with these words.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut if I beg you to make it up?â\\x80\\x9d said Varia.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd youâ\\x80\\x99ll go to Nastasia Philipovnaâ\\x80\\x99s this eveningâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf you insist: but, judge for yourself, can I go, ought I to go?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut she is not that sort of woman, I tell you!â\\x80\\x9d said Gania, angrily.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe was only acting.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know thatâ\\x80\\x94I know that; but what a part to play! And think what she\\r\\nmust take _you_ for, Gania! I know she kissed motherâ\\x80\\x99s hand, and all\\r\\nthat, but she laughed at you, all the same. All this is not good enough\\r\\nfor seventy-five thousand roubles, my dear boy. You are capable of\\r\\nhonourable feelings still, and thatâ\\x80\\x99s why I am talking to you so. Oh!\\r\\n_do_ take care what you are doing! Donâ\\x80\\x99t you know yourself that it will\\r\\nend badly, Gania?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo saying, and in a state of violent agitation, Varia left the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere, they are all like that,â\\x80\\x9d said Gania, laughing, â\\x80\\x9cjust as if I do\\r\\nnot know all about it much better than they do.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe sat down with these words, evidently intending to prolong his visit.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf you know it so well,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince a little timidly, â\\x80\\x9cwhy do you\\r\\nchoose all this worry for the sake of the seventy-five thousand, which,\\r\\nyou confess, does not cover it?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI didnâ\\x80\\x99t mean that,â\\x80\\x9d said Gania; â\\x80\\x9cbut while we are upon the subject,\\r\\nlet me hear your opinion. Is all this worry worth seventy-five thousand\\r\\nor not?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly not.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course! And it would be a disgrace to marry so, eh?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA great disgrace.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, well, then you may know that I shall certainly do it, now. I shall\\r\\ncertainly marry her. I was not quite sure of myself before, but now I\\r\\nam. Donâ\\x80\\x99t say a word: I know what you want to tell meâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo. I was only going to say that what surprises me most of all is your\\r\\nextraordinary confidence.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow so? What in?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat Nastasia Philipovna will accept you, and that the question is as\\r\\ngood as settled; and secondly, that even if she did, you would be able\\r\\nto pocket the money. Of course, I know very little about it, but thatâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nmy view. When a man marries for money it often happens that the wife\\r\\nkeeps the money in her own hands.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course, you donâ\\x80\\x99t know all; but, I assure you, you neednâ\\x80\\x99t be\\r\\nafraid, it wonâ\\x80\\x99t be like that in our case. There are circumstances,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nsaid Gania, rather excitedly. â\\x80\\x9cAnd as to her answer to me, thereâ\\x80\\x99s no\\r\\ndoubt about that. Why should you suppose she will refuse me?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, I only judge by what I see. Varvara Ardalionovna said just nowâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh sheâ\\x80\\x94they donâ\\x80\\x99t know anything about it! Nastasia was only chaffing\\r\\nRogojin. I was alarmed at first, but I have thought better of it now;\\r\\nshe was simply laughing at him. She looks on me as a fool because I\\r\\nshow that I meant her money, and doesnâ\\x80\\x99t realize that there are other\\r\\nmen who would deceive her in far worse fashion. Iâ\\x80\\x99m not going to\\r\\npretend anything, and youâ\\x80\\x99ll see sheâ\\x80\\x99ll marry me, all right. If she\\r\\nlikes to live quietly, so she shall; but if she gives me any of her\\r\\nnonsense, I shall leave her at once, but I shall keep the money. Iâ\\x80\\x99m\\r\\nnot going to look a fool; thatâ\\x80\\x99s the first thing, not to look a fool.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut Nastasia Philipovna seems to me to be such a _sensible_ woman,\\r\\nand, as such, why should she run blindly into this business? Thatâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nwhat puzzles me so,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou donâ\\x80\\x99t know all, you see; I tell you there are thingsâ\\x80\\x94and besides,\\r\\nIâ\\x80\\x99m sure that she is persuaded that I love her to distraction, and I\\r\\ngive you my word I have a strong suspicion that she loves me, tooâ\\x80\\x94in\\r\\nher own way, of course. She thinks she will be able to make a sort of\\r\\nslave of me all my life; but I shall prepare a little surprise for her.\\r\\nI donâ\\x80\\x99t know whether I ought to be confidential with you, prince; but,\\r\\nI assure you, you are the only decent fellow I have come across. I have\\r\\nnot spoken so sincerely as I am doing at this moment for years. There\\r\\nare uncommonly few honest people about, prince; there isnâ\\x80\\x99t one\\r\\nhonester than Ptitsin, heâ\\x80\\x99s the best of the lot. Are you laughing? You\\r\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t know, perhaps, that blackguards like honest people, and being one\\r\\nmyself I like you. _Why_ am I a blackguard? Tell me honestly, now. They\\r\\nall call me a blackguard because of her, and I have got into the way of\\r\\nthinking myself one. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s what is so bad about the business.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_I_ for one shall never think you a blackguard again,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\r\\nprince. â\\x80\\x9cI confess I had a poor opinion of you at first, but I have\\r\\nbeen so joyfully surprised about you just now; itâ\\x80\\x99s a good lesson for\\r\\nme. I shall never judge again without a thorough trial. I see now that\\r\\nyou are not only not a blackguard, but are not even quite spoiled. I\\r\\nsee that you are quite an ordinary man, not original in the least\\r\\ndegree, but rather weak.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nGania laughed sarcastically, but said nothing. The prince, seeing that\\r\\nhe did not quite like the last remark, blushed, and was silent too.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHas my father asked you for money?â\\x80\\x9d asked Gania, suddenly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t give it to him if he does. Fancy, he was a decent, respectable\\r\\nman once! He was received in the best society; he was not always the\\r\\nliar he is now. Of course, wine is at the bottom of it all; but he is a\\r\\ngood deal worse than an innocent liar now. Do you know that he keeps a\\r\\nmistress? I canâ\\x80\\x99t understand how mother is so long-suffering. Did he\\r\\ntell you the story of the siege of Kars? Or perhaps the one about his\\r\\ngrey horse that talked? He loves to enlarge on these absurd histories.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nAnd Gania burst into a fit of laughter. Suddenly he turned to the\\r\\nprince and asked: â\\x80\\x9cWhy are you looking at me like that?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am surprised to see you laugh in that way, like a child. You came to\\r\\nmake friends with me again just now, and you said, â\\x80\\x98I will kiss your\\r\\nhand, if you like,â\\x80\\x99 just as a child would have said it. And then, all\\r\\nat once you are talking of this mad projectâ\\x80\\x94of these seventy-five\\r\\nthousand roubles! It all seems so absurd and impossible.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, what conclusion have you reached?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat you are rushing madly into the undertaking, and that you would do\\r\\nwell to think it over again. It is more than possible that Varvara\\r\\nArdalionovna is right.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh! now you begin to moralize! I know that I am only a child, very\\r\\nwell,â\\x80\\x9d replied Gania impatiently. â\\x80\\x9cThat is proved by my having this\\r\\nconversation with you. It is not for money only, prince, that I am\\r\\nrushing into this affair,â\\x80\\x9d he continued, hardly master of his words, so\\r\\nclosely had his vanity been touched. â\\x80\\x9cIf I reckoned on that I should\\r\\ncertainly be deceived, for I am still too weak in mind and character. I\\r\\nam obeying a passion, an impulse perhaps, because I have but one aim,\\r\\none that overmasters all else. You imagine that once I am in possession\\r\\nof these seventy-five thousand roubles, I shall rush to buy a\\r\\ncarriage... No, I shall go on wearing the old overcoat I have worn for\\r\\nthree years, and I shall give up my club. I shall follow the example of\\r\\nmen who have made their fortunes. When Ptitsin was seventeen he slept\\r\\nin the street, he sold pen-knives, and began with a copeck; now he has\\r\\nsixty thousand roubles, but to get them, what has he not done? Well, I\\r\\nshall be spared such a hard beginning, and shall start with a little\\r\\ncapital. In fifteen years people will say, â\\x80\\x98Look, thatâ\\x80\\x99s Ivolgin, the\\r\\nking of the Jews!â\\x80\\x99 You say that I have no originality. Now mark this,\\r\\nprinceâ\\x80\\x94there is nothing so offensive to a man of our time and race than\\r\\nto be told that he is wanting in originality, that he is weak in\\r\\ncharacter, has no particular talent, and is, in short, an ordinary\\r\\nperson. You have not even done me the honour of looking upon me as a\\r\\nrogue. Do you know, I could have knocked you down for that just now!\\r\\nYou wounded me more cruelly than Epanchin, who thinks me capable of\\r\\nselling him my wife! Observe, it was a perfectly gratuitous idea on his\\r\\npart, seeing there has never been any discussion of it between us! This\\r\\nhas exasperated me, and I am determined to make a fortune! I will do\\r\\nit! Once I am rich, I shall be a genius, an extremely original man. One\\r\\nof the vilest and most hateful things connected with money is that it\\r\\ncan buy even talent; and will do so as long as the world lasts. You\\r\\nwill say that this is childishâ\\x80\\x94or romantic. Well, that will be all the\\r\\nbetter for me, but the thing shall be done. I will carry it through. He\\r\\nlaughs most, who laughs last. Why does Epanchin insult me? Simply\\r\\nbecause, socially, I am a nobody. However, enough for the present.\\r\\nColia has put his nose in to tell us dinner is ready, twice. Iâ\\x80\\x99m dining\\r\\nout. I shall come and talk to you now and then; you shall be\\r\\ncomfortable enough with us. They are sure to make you one of the\\r\\nfamily. I think you and I will either be great friends or enemies. Look\\r\\nhere now, supposing I had kissed your hand just now, as I offered to do\\r\\nin all sincerity, should I have hated you for it afterwards?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly, but not always. You would not have been able to keep it up,\\r\\nand would have ended by forgiving me,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, after a pause\\r\\nfor reflection, and with a pleasant smile.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOho, how careful one has to be with you, prince! Havenâ\\x80\\x99t you put a\\r\\ndrop of poison in that remark now, eh? By the wayâ\\x80\\x94ha, ha, ha!â\\x80\\x94I forgot\\r\\nto ask, was I right in believing that you were a good deal struck\\r\\nyourself with Nastasia Philipovna.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYe-yes.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAre you in love with her?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cN-no.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd yet you flush up as red as a rosebud! Comeâ\\x80\\x94itâ\\x80\\x99s all right. Iâ\\x80\\x99m not\\r\\ngoing to laugh at you. Do you know she is a very virtuous woman?\\r\\nBelieve it or not, as you like. You think she and Totskiâ\\x80\\x94not a bit of\\r\\nit, not a bit of it! Not for ever so long! _Au revoir!_â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nGania left the room in great good humour. The prince stayed behind, and\\r\\nmeditated alone for a few minutes. At length, Colia popped his head in\\r\\nonce more.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t want any dinner, thanks, Colia. I had too good a lunch at\\r\\nGeneral Epanchinâ\\x80\\x99s.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nColia came into the room and gave the prince a note; it was from the\\r\\ngeneral and was carefully sealed up. It was clear from Coliaâ\\x80\\x99s face how\\r\\npainful it was to him to deliver the missive. The prince read it, rose,\\r\\nand took his hat.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s only a couple of yards,â\\x80\\x9d said Colia, blushing.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s sitting there over his bottleâ\\x80\\x94and how they can give him credit, I\\r\\ncannot understand. Donâ\\x80\\x99t tell mother I brought you the note, prince; I\\r\\nhave sworn not to do it a thousand times, but Iâ\\x80\\x99m always so sorry for\\r\\nhim. Donâ\\x80\\x99t stand on ceremony, give him some trifle, and let that end\\r\\nit.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome along, Colia, I want to see your father. I have an idea,â\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nthe prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nXII.\\r\\n\\r\\nColia took the prince to a public-house in the Litaynaya, not far off.\\r\\nIn one of the side rooms there sat at a tableâ\\x80\\x94looking like one of the\\r\\nregular guests of the establishmentâ\\x80\\x94Ardalion Alexandrovitch, with a\\r\\nbottle before him, and a newspaper on his knee. He was waiting for the\\r\\nprince, and no sooner did the latter appear than he began a long\\r\\nharangue about something or other; but so far gone was he that the\\r\\nprince could hardly understand a word.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have not got a ten-rouble note,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince; â\\x80\\x9cbut here is a\\r\\ntwenty-five. Change it and give me back the fifteen, or I shall be left\\r\\nwithout a farthing myself.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, of course, of course; and you quite understand that Iâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes; and I have another request to make, general. Have you ever been\\r\\nat Nastasia Philipovnaâ\\x80\\x99s?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI? I? Do you mean me? Often, my friend, often! I only pretended I had\\r\\nnot in order to avoid a painful subject. You saw today, you were a\\r\\nwitness, that I did all that a kind, an indulgent father could do. Now\\r\\na father of altogether another type shall step into the scene. You\\r\\nshall see; the old soldier shall lay bare this intrigue, or a shameless\\r\\nwoman will force her way into a respectable and noble family.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, quite so. I wished to ask you whether you could show me the way\\r\\nto Nastasia Philipovnaâ\\x80\\x99s tonight. I must go; I have business with her;\\r\\nI was not invited but I was introduced. Anyhow I am ready to trespass\\r\\nthe laws of propriety if only I can get in somehow or other.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear young friend, you have hit on my very idea. It was not for\\r\\nthis rubbish I asked you to come over hereâ\\x80\\x9d (he pocketed the money,\\r\\nhowever, at this point), â\\x80\\x9cit was to invite your alliance in the\\r\\ncampaign against Nastasia Philipovna tonight. How well it sounds,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98General Ivolgin and Prince Muishkin.â\\x80\\x99 Thatâ\\x80\\x99ll fetch her, I think, eh?\\r\\nCapital! Weâ\\x80\\x99ll go at nine; thereâ\\x80\\x99s time yet.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhere does she live?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, a long way off, near the Great Theatre, just in the square\\r\\nthereâ\\x80\\x94It wonâ\\x80\\x99t be a large party.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general sat on and on. He had ordered a fresh bottle when the\\r\\nprince arrived; this took him an hour to drink, and then he had\\r\\nanother, and another, during the consumption of which he told pretty\\r\\nnearly the whole story of his life. The prince was in despair. He felt\\r\\nthat though he had but applied to this miserable old drunkard because\\r\\nhe saw no other way of getting to Nastasia Philipovnaâ\\x80\\x99s, yet he had\\r\\nbeen very wrong to put the slightest confidence in such a man.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last he rose and declared that he would wait no longer. The general\\r\\nrose too, drank the last drops that he could squeeze out of the bottle,\\r\\nand staggered into the street.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuishkin began to despair. He could not imagine how he had been so\\r\\nfoolish as to trust this man. He only wanted one thing, and that was to\\r\\nget to Nastasia Philipovnaâ\\x80\\x99s, even at the cost of a certain amount of\\r\\nimpropriety. But now the scandal threatened to be more than he had\\r\\nbargained for. By this time Ardalion Alexandrovitch was quite\\r\\nintoxicated, and he kept his companion listening while he discoursed\\r\\neloquently and pathetically on subjects of all kinds, interspersed with\\r\\ntorrents of recrimination against the members of his family. He\\r\\ninsisted that all his troubles were caused by their bad conduct, and\\r\\ntime alone would put an end to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last they reached the Litaynaya. The thaw increased steadily, a\\r\\nwarm, unhealthy wind blew through the streets, vehicles splashed\\r\\nthrough the mud, and the iron shoes of horses and mules rang on the\\r\\npaving stones. Crowds of melancholy people plodded wearily along the\\r\\nfootpaths, with here and there a drunken man among them.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you see those brightly-lighted windows?â\\x80\\x9d said the general. â\\x80\\x9cMany of\\r\\nmy old comrades-in-arms live about here, and I, who served longer, and\\r\\nsuffered more than any of them, am walking on foot to the house of a\\r\\nwoman of rather questionable reputation! A man, look you, who has\\r\\nthirteen bullets on his breast!... You donâ\\x80\\x99t believe it? Well, I can\\r\\nassure you it was entirely on my account that Pirogoff telegraphed to\\r\\nParis, and left Sebastopol at the greatest risk during the siege.\\r\\nNelaton, the Tuileries surgeon, demanded a safe conduct, in the name of\\r\\nscience, into the besieged city in order to attend my wounds. The\\r\\ngovernment knows all about it. â\\x80\\x98Thatâ\\x80\\x99s the Ivolgin with thirteen\\r\\nbullets in him!â\\x80\\x99 Thatâ\\x80\\x99s how they speak of me.... Do you see that house,\\r\\nprince? One of my old friends lives on the first floor, with his large\\r\\nfamily. In this and five other houses, three overlooking Nevsky, two in\\r\\nthe Morskaya, are all that remain of my personal friends. Nina\\r\\nAlexandrovna gave them up long ago, but I keep in touch with them\\r\\nstill... I may say I find refreshment in this little coterie, in thus\\r\\nmeeting my old acquaintances and subordinates, who worship me still, in\\r\\nspite of all. General Sokolovitch (by the way, I have not called on him\\r\\nlately, or seen Anna Fedorovna)... You know, my dear prince, when a\\r\\nperson does not receive company himself, he gives up going to other\\r\\npeopleâ\\x80\\x99s houses involuntarily. And yet... well... you look as if you\\r\\ndidnâ\\x80\\x99t believe me.... Well now, why should I not present the son of my\\r\\nold friend and companion to this delightful familyâ\\x80\\x94General Ivolgin and\\r\\nPrince Muishkin? You will see a lovely girlâ\\x80\\x94what am I sayingâ\\x80\\x94a lovely\\r\\ngirl? No, indeed, two, three! Ornaments of this city and of society:\\r\\nbeauty, education, cultureâ\\x80\\x94the woman questionâ\\x80\\x94poetryâ\\x80\\x94everything! Added\\r\\nto which is the fact that each one will have a dot of at least eighty\\r\\nthousand roubles. No bad thing, eh?... In a word I absolutely must\\r\\nintroduce you to them: it is a duty, an obligation. General Ivolgin and\\r\\nPrince Muishkin. Tableau!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAt once? Now? You must have forgotten...â\\x80\\x9d began the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I have forgotten nothing. Come! This is the houseâ\\x80\\x94up this\\r\\nmagnificent staircase. I am surprised not to see the porter, but ....\\r\\nit is a holiday... and the man has gone off... Drunken fool! Why have\\r\\nthey not got rid of him? Sokolovitch owes all the happiness he has had\\r\\nin the service and in his private life to me, and me alone, but... here\\r\\nwe are.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince followed quietly, making no further objection for fear of\\r\\nirritating the old man. At the same time he fervently hoped that\\r\\nGeneral Sokolovitch and his family would fade away like a mirage in the\\r\\ndesert, so that the visitors could escape, by merely returning\\r\\ndownstairs. But to his horror he saw that General Ivolgin was quite\\r\\nfamiliar with the house, and really seemed to have friends there. At\\r\\nevery step he named some topographical or biographical detail that left\\r\\nnothing to be desired on the score of accuracy. When they arrived at\\r\\nlast, on the first floor, and the general turned to ring the bell to\\r\\nthe right, the prince decided to run away, but a curious incident\\r\\nstopped him momentarily.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have made a mistake, general,â\\x80\\x9d said he. â\\x80\\x9cThe name on the door is\\r\\nKoulakoff, and you were going to see General Sokolovitch.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cKoulakoff... Koulakoff means nothing. This is Sokolovitchâ\\x80\\x99s flat, and\\r\\nI am ringing at his door.... What do I care for Koulakoff?... Here\\r\\ncomes someone to open.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, the door opened directly, and the footman informed the\\r\\nvisitors that the family were all away.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat a pity! What a pity! Itâ\\x80\\x99s just my luck!â\\x80\\x9d repeated Ardalion\\r\\nAlexandrovitch over and over again, in regretful tones. â\\x80\\x9cWhen your\\r\\nmaster and mistress return, my man, tell them that General Ivolgin and\\r\\nPrince Muishkin desired to present themselves, and that they were\\r\\nextremely sorry, excessively grieved...â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJust then another person belonging to the household was seen at the\\r\\nback of the hall. It was a woman of some forty years, dressed in sombre\\r\\ncolours, probably a housekeeper or a governess. Hearing the names she\\r\\ncame forward with a look of suspicion on her face.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMarie Alexandrovna is not at home,â\\x80\\x9d said she, staring hard at the\\r\\ngeneral. â\\x80\\x9cShe has gone to her motherâ\\x80\\x99s, with Alexandra Michailovna.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAlexandra Michailovna out, too! How disappointing! Would you believe\\r\\nit, I am always so unfortunate! May I most respectfully ask you to\\r\\npresent my compliments to Alexandra Michailovna, and remind her... tell\\r\\nher, that with my whole heart I wish for her what she wished for\\r\\nherself on Thursday evening, while she was listening to Chopinâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nBallade. She will remember. I wish it with all sincerity. General\\r\\nIvolgin and Prince Muishkin!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe womanâ\\x80\\x99s face changed; she lost her suspicious expression.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI will not fail to deliver your message,â\\x80\\x9d she replied, and bowed them\\r\\nout.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they went downstairs the general regretted repeatedly that he had\\r\\nfailed to introduce the prince to his friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou know I am a bit of a poet,â\\x80\\x9d said he. â\\x80\\x9cHave you noticed it? The\\r\\npoetic soul, you know.â\\x80\\x9d Then he added suddenlyâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cBut after all... after\\r\\nall I believe we made a mistake this time! I remember that the\\r\\nSokolovitchâ\\x80\\x99s live in another house, and what is more, they are just\\r\\nnow in Moscow. Yes, I certainly was at fault. However, it is of no\\r\\nconsequence.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cJust tell me,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince in reply, â\\x80\\x9cmay I count still on your\\r\\nassistance? Or shall I go on alone to see Nastasia Philipovna?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCount on my assistance? Go alone? How can you ask me that question,\\r\\nwhen it is a matter on which the fate of my family so largely depends?\\r\\nYou donâ\\x80\\x99t know Ivolgin, my friend. To trust Ivolgin is to trust a rock;\\r\\nthatâ\\x80\\x99s how the first squadron I commanded spoke of me. â\\x80\\x98Depend upon\\r\\nIvolgin,â\\x80\\x99 said they all, â\\x80\\x98he is as steady as a rock.â\\x80\\x99 But, excuse me, I\\r\\nmust just call at a house on our way, a house where I have found\\r\\nconsolation and help in all my trials for years.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are going home?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo... I wish... to visit Madame Terentieff, the widow of Captain\\r\\nTerentieff, my old subordinate and friend. She helps me to keep up my\\r\\ncourage, and to bear the trials of my domestic life, and as I have an\\r\\nextra burden on my mind today...â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt seems to me,â\\x80\\x9d interrupted the prince, â\\x80\\x9cthat I was foolish to\\r\\ntrouble you just now. However, at present you... Good-bye!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIndeed, you must not go away like that, young man, you must not!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\ncried the general. â\\x80\\x9cMy friend here is a widow, the mother of a family;\\r\\nher words come straight from her heart, and find an echo in mine. A\\r\\nvisit to her is merely an affair of a few minutes; I am quite at home\\r\\nin her house. I will have a wash, and dress, and then we can drive to\\r\\nthe Grand Theatre. Make up your mind to spend the evening with me....\\r\\nWe are just thereâ\\x80\\x94thatâ\\x80\\x99s the house... Why, Colia! you here! Well, is\\r\\nMarfa Borisovna at home or have you only just come?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh no! I have been here a long while,â\\x80\\x9d replied Colia, who was at the\\r\\nfront door when the general met him. â\\x80\\x9cI am keeping Hippolyte company.\\r\\nHe is worse, and has been in bed all day. I came down to buy some\\r\\ncards. Marfa Borisovna expects you. But what a state you are in,\\r\\nfather!â\\x80\\x9d added the boy, noticing his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s unsteady gait. â\\x80\\x9cWell, let\\r\\nus go in.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOn meeting Colia the prince determined to accompany the general, though\\r\\nhe made up his mind to stay as short a time as possible. He wanted\\r\\nColia, but firmly resolved to leave the general behind. He could not\\r\\nforgive himself for being so simple as to imagine that Ivolgin would be\\r\\nof any use. The three climbed up the long staircase until they reached\\r\\nthe fourth floor where Madame Terentieff lived.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou intend to introduce the prince?â\\x80\\x9d asked Colia, as they went up.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, my boy. I wish to present him: General Ivolgin and Prince\\r\\nMuishkin! But whatâ\\x80\\x99s the matter?... what?... How is Marfa Borisovna?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou know, father, you would have done much better not to come at all!\\r\\nShe is ready to eat you up! You have not shown yourself since the day\\r\\nbefore yesterday and she is expecting the money. Why did you promise\\r\\nher any? You are always the same! Well, now you will have to get out of\\r\\nit as best you can.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey stopped before a somewhat low doorway on the fourth floor.\\r\\nArdalion Alexandrovitch, evidently much out of countenance, pushed\\r\\nMuishkin in front.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI will wait here,â\\x80\\x9d he stammered. â\\x80\\x9cI should like to surprise her. ....â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nColia entered first, and as the door stood open, the mistress of the\\r\\nhouse peeped out. The surprise of the generalâ\\x80\\x99s imagination fell very\\r\\nflat, for she at once began to address him in terms of reproach.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarfa Borisovna was about forty years of age. She wore a\\r\\ndressing-jacket, her feet were in slippers, her face painted, and her\\r\\nhair was in dozens of small plaits. No sooner did she catch sight of\\r\\nArdalion Alexandrovitch than she screamed:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere he is, that wicked, mean wretch! I knew it was he! My heart\\r\\nmisgave me!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old man tried to put a good face on the affair.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome, let us go inâ\\x80\\x94itâ\\x80\\x99s all right,â\\x80\\x9d he whispered in the princeâ\\x80\\x99s ear.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it was more serious than he wished to think. As soon as the\\r\\nvisitors had crossed the low dark hall, and entered the narrow\\r\\nreception-room, furnished with half a dozen cane chairs, and two small\\r\\ncard-tables, Madame Terentieff, in the shrill tones habitual to her,\\r\\ncontinued her stream of invectives.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAre you not ashamed? Are you not ashamed? You barbarian! You tyrant!\\r\\nYou have robbed me of all I possessedâ\\x80\\x94you have sucked my bones to the\\r\\nmarrow. How long shall I be your victim? Shameless, dishonourable man!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMarfa Borisovna! Marfa Borisovna! Here is... the Prince Muishkin!\\r\\nGeneral Ivolgin and Prince Muishkin,â\\x80\\x9d stammered the disconcerted old\\r\\nman.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWould you believe,â\\x80\\x9d said the mistress of the house, suddenly\\r\\naddressing the prince, â\\x80\\x9cwould you believe that that man has not even\\r\\nspared my orphan children? He has stolen everything I possessed, sold\\r\\neverything, pawned everything; he has left me nothingâ\\x80\\x94nothing! What am\\r\\nI to do with your IOUâ\\x80\\x99s, you cunning, unscrupulous rogue? Answer,\\r\\ndevourer! answer, heart of stone! How shall I feed my orphans? with\\r\\nwhat shall I nourish them? And now he has come, he is drunk! He can\\r\\nscarcely stand. How, oh how, have I offended the Almighty, that He\\r\\nshould bring this curse upon me! Answer, you worthless villain,\\r\\nanswer!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this was too much for the general.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHere are twenty-five roubles, Marfa Borisovna... it is all that I can\\r\\ngive... and I owe even these to the princeâ\\x80\\x99s generosityâ\\x80\\x94my noble\\r\\nfriend. I have been cruelly deceived. Such is... life... Now... Excuse\\r\\nme, I am very weak,â\\x80\\x9d he continued, standing in the centre of the room,\\r\\nand bowing to all sides. â\\x80\\x9cI am faint; excuse me! Lenotchka... a\\r\\ncushion... my dear!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLenotchka, a little girl of eight, ran to fetch the cushion at once,\\r\\nand placed it on the rickety old sofa. The general meant to have said\\r\\nmuch more, but as soon as he had stretched himself out, he turned his\\r\\nface to the wall, and slept the sleep of the just.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a grave and ceremonious air, Marfa Borisovna motioned the prince\\r\\nto a chair at one of the card-tables. She seated herself opposite,\\r\\nleaned her right cheek on her hand, and sat in silence, her eyes fixed\\r\\non Muishkin, now and again sighing deeply. The three children, two\\r\\nlittle girls and a boy, Lenotchka being the eldest, came and leant on\\r\\nthe table and also stared steadily at him. Presently Colia appeared\\r\\nfrom the adjoining room.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am very glad indeed to have met you here, Colia,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCan you do something for me? I must see Nastasia Philipovna, and I\\r\\nasked Ardalion Alexandrovitch just now to take me to her house, but he\\r\\nhas gone to sleep, as you see. Will you show me the way, for I do not\\r\\nknow the street? I have the address, though; it is close to the Grand\\r\\nTheatre.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNastasia Philipovna? She does not live there, and to tell you the\\r\\ntruth my father has never been to her house! It is strange that you\\r\\nshould have depended on him! She lives near Wladimir Street, at the\\r\\nFive Corners, and it is quite close by. Will you go directly? It is\\r\\njust half-past nine. I will show you the way with pleasure.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nColia and the prince went off together. Alas! the latter had no money\\r\\nto pay for a cab, so they were obliged to walk.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI should have liked to have taken you to see Hippolyte,â\\x80\\x9d said Colia.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe is the eldest son of the lady you met just now, and was in the next\\r\\nroom. He is ill, and has been in bed all day. But he is rather strange,\\r\\nand extremely sensitive, and I thought he might be upset considering\\r\\nthe circumstances in which you came... Somehow it touches me less, as\\r\\nit concerns my father, while it is _his_ mother. That, of course, makes\\r\\na great difference. What is a terrible disgrace to a woman, does not\\r\\ndisgrace a man, at least not in the same way. Perhaps public opinion is\\r\\nwrong in condemning one sex, and excusing the other. Hippolyte is an\\r\\nextremely clever boy, but so prejudiced. He is really a slave to his\\r\\nopinions.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you say he is consumptive?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes. It really would be happier for him to die young. If I were in his\\r\\nplace I should certainly long for death. He is unhappy about his\\r\\nbrother and sisters, the children you saw. If it were possible, if we\\r\\nonly had a little money, we should leave our respective families, and\\r\\nlive together in a little apartment of our own. It is our dream. But,\\r\\ndo you know, when I was talking over your affair with him, he was\\r\\nangry, and said that anyone who did not call out a man who had given\\r\\nhim a blow was a coward. He is very irritable to-day, and I left off\\r\\narguing the matter with him. So Nastasia Philipovna has invited you to\\r\\ngo and see her?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTo tell the truth, she has not.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen how do you come to be going there?â\\x80\\x9d cried Colia, so much\\r\\nastonished that he stopped short in the middle of the pavement. â\\x80\\x9cAnd...\\r\\nand are you going to her â\\x80\\x98At Homeâ\\x80\\x99 in that costume?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know, really, whether I shall be allowed in at all. If she\\r\\nwill receive me, so much the better. If not, the matter is ended. As to\\r\\nmy clothesâ\\x80\\x94what can I do?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAre you going there for some particular reason, or only as a way of\\r\\ngetting into her society, and that of her friends?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I have really an object in going... That is, I am going on\\r\\nbusiness it is difficult to explain, but...â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, whether you go on business or not is your affair, I do not want\\r\\nto know. The only important thing, in my eyes, is that you should not\\r\\nbe going there simply for the pleasure of spending your evening in such\\r\\ncompanyâ\\x80\\x94cocottes, generals, usurers! If that were the case I should\\r\\ndespise and laugh at you. There are terribly few honest people here,\\r\\nand hardly any whom one can respect, although people put on airsâ\\x80\\x94Varia\\r\\nespecially! Have you noticed, prince, how many adventurers there are\\r\\nnowadays? Especially here, in our dear Russia. How it has happened I\\r\\nnever can understand. There used to be a certain amount of solidity in\\r\\nall things, but now what happens? Everything is exposed to the public\\r\\ngaze, veils are thrown back, every wound is probed by careless fingers.\\r\\nWe are for ever present at an orgy of scandalous revelations. Parents\\r\\nblush when they remember their old-fashioned morality. At Moscow lately\\r\\na father was heard urging his son to stop at nothingâ\\x80\\x94at nothing, mind\\r\\nyou!â\\x80\\x94to get money! The press seized upon the story, of course, and now\\r\\nit is public property. Look at my father, the general! See what he is,\\r\\nand yet, I assure you, he is an honest man! Only... he drinks too much,\\r\\nand his morals are not all we could desire. Yes, thatâ\\x80\\x99s true! I pity\\r\\nhim, to tell the truth, but I dare not say so, because everybody would\\r\\nlaugh at meâ\\x80\\x94but I do pity him! And who are the really clever men, after\\r\\nall? Money-grubbers, every one of them, from the first to the last.\\r\\nHippolyte finds excuses for money-lending, and says it is a necessity.\\r\\nHe talks about the economic movement, and the ebb and flow of capital;\\r\\nthe devil knows what he means. It makes me angry to hear him talk so,\\r\\nbut he is soured by his troubles. Just imagineâ\\x80\\x94the general keeps his\\r\\nmotherâ\\x80\\x94but she lends him money! She lends it for a week or ten days at\\r\\nvery high interest! Isnâ\\x80\\x99t it disgusting? And then, you would hardly\\r\\nbelieve it, but my motherâ\\x80\\x94Nina Alexandrovnaâ\\x80\\x94helps Hippolyte in all\\r\\nsorts of ways, sends him money and clothes. She even goes as far as\\r\\nhelping the children, through Hippolyte, because their mother cares\\r\\nnothing about them, and Varia does the same.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, just now you said there were no honest nor good people about,\\r\\nthat there were only money-grubbersâ\\x80\\x94and here they are quite close at\\r\\nhand, these honest and good people, your mother and Varia! I think\\r\\nthere is a good deal of moral strength in helping people in such\\r\\ncircumstances.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVaria does it from pride, and likes showing off, and giving herself\\r\\nairs. As to my mother, I really do admire herâ\\x80\\x94yes, and honour her.\\r\\nHippolyte, hardened as he is, feels it. He laughed at first, and\\r\\nthought it vulgar of herâ\\x80\\x94but now, he is sometimes quite touched and\\r\\novercome by her kindness. Hâ\\x80\\x99m! You call that being strong and good? I\\r\\nwill remember that! Gania knows nothing about it. He would say that it\\r\\nwas encouraging vice.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, Gania knows nothing about it? It seems there are many things that\\r\\nGania does not know,â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed the prince, as he considered Coliaâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nlast words.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you know, I like you very much indeed, prince? I shall never forget\\r\\nabout this afternoon.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI like you too, Colia.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cListen to me! You are going to live here, are you not?â\\x80\\x9d said Colia. â\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nmean to get something to do directly, and earn money. Then shall we\\r\\nthree live together? You, and I, and Hippolyte? We will hire a flat,\\r\\nand let the general come and visit us. What do you say?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt would be very pleasant,â\\x80\\x9d returned the prince. â\\x80\\x9cBut we must see. I\\r\\nam really rather worried just now. What! are we there already? Is that\\r\\nthe house? What a long flight of steps! And thereâ\\x80\\x99s a porter! Well,\\r\\nColia I donâ\\x80\\x99t know what will come of it all.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince seemed quite distracted for the moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou must tell me all about it tomorrow! Donâ\\x80\\x99t be afraid. I wish you\\r\\nsuccess; we agree so entirely that I can do so, although I do not\\r\\nunderstand why you are here. Good-bye!â\\x80\\x9d cried Colia excitedly. â\\x80\\x9cNow I\\r\\nwill rush back and tell Hippolyte all about our plans and proposals!\\r\\nBut as to your getting inâ\\x80\\x94donâ\\x80\\x99t be in the least afraid. You will see\\r\\nher. She is so original about everything. Itâ\\x80\\x99s the first floor. The\\r\\nporter will show you.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nXIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince was very nervous as he reached the outer door; but he did\\r\\nhis best to encourage himself with the reflection that the worst thing\\r\\nthat could happen to him would be that he would not be received, or,\\r\\nperhaps, received, then laughed at for coming.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there was another question, which terrified him considerably, and\\r\\nthat was: what was he going to do when he _did_ get in? And to this\\r\\nquestion he could fashion no satisfactory reply.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf only he could find an opportunity of coming close up to Nastasia\\r\\nPhilipovna and saying to her: â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t ruin yourself by marrying this\\r\\nman. He does not love you, he only loves your money. He told me so\\r\\nhimself, and so did Aglaya Ivanovna, and I have come on purpose to warn\\r\\nyouâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94but even that did not seem quite a legitimate or practicable thing\\r\\nto do. Then, again, there was another delicate question, to which he\\r\\ncould not find an answer; dared not, in fact, think of it; but at the\\r\\nvery idea of which he trembled and blushed. However, in spite of all\\r\\nhis fears and heart-quakings he went in, and asked for Nastasia\\r\\nPhilipovna.\\r\\n\\r\\nNastasia occupied a medium-sized, but distinctly tasteful, flat,\\r\\nbeautifully furnished and arranged. At one period of these five years\\r\\nof Petersburg life, Totski had certainly not spared his expenditure\\r\\nupon her. He had calculated upon her eventual love, and tried to tempt\\r\\nher with a lavish outlay upon comforts and luxuries, knowing too well\\r\\nhow easily the heart accustoms itself to comforts, and how difficult it\\r\\nis to tear oneâ\\x80\\x99s self away from luxuries which have become habitual\\r\\nand, little by little, indispensable.\\r\\n\\r\\nNastasia did not reject all this, she even loved her comforts and\\r\\nluxuries, but, strangely enough, never became, in the least degree,\\r\\ndependent upon them, and always gave the impression that she could do\\r\\njust as well without them. In fact, she went so far as to inform Totski\\r\\non several occasions that such was the case, which the latter gentleman\\r\\nconsidered a very unpleasant communication indeed.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, of late, Totski had observed many strange and original features\\r\\nand characteristics in Nastasia, which he had neither known nor\\r\\nreckoned upon in former times, and some of these fascinated him, even\\r\\nnow, in spite of the fact that all his old calculations with regard to\\r\\nher were long ago cast to the winds.\\r\\n\\r\\nA maid opened the door for the prince (Nastasiaâ\\x80\\x99s servants were all\\r\\nfemales) and, to his surprise, received his request to announce him to\\r\\nher mistress without any astonishment. Neither his dirty boots, nor his\\r\\nwide-brimmed hat, nor his sleeveless cloak, nor his evident confusion\\r\\nof manner, produced the least impression upon her. She helped him off\\r\\nwith his cloak, and begged him to wait a moment in the ante-room while\\r\\nshe announced him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe company assembled at Nastasia Philipovnaâ\\x80\\x99s consisted of none but\\r\\nher most intimate friends, and formed a very small party in comparison\\r\\nwith her usual gatherings on this anniversary.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first place there were present Totski, and General Epanchin.\\r\\nThey were both highly amiable, but both appeared to be labouring under\\r\\na half-hidden feeling of anxiety as to the result of Nastasiaâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ndeliberations with regard to Gania, which result was to be made public\\r\\nthis evening.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, of course, there was Gania who was by no means so amiable as his\\r\\nelders, but stood apart, gloomy, and miserable, and silent. He had\\r\\ndetermined not to bring Varia with him; but Nastasia had not even asked\\r\\nafter her, though no sooner had he arrived than she had reminded him of\\r\\nthe episode between himself and the prince. The general, who had heard\\r\\nnothing of it before, began to listen with some interest, while Gania,\\r\\ndrily, but with perfect candour, went through the whole history,\\r\\nincluding the fact of his apology to the prince. He finished by\\r\\ndeclaring that the prince was a most extraordinary man, and goodness\\r\\nknows why he had been considered an idiot hitherto, for he was very far\\r\\nfrom being one.\\r\\n\\r\\nNastasia listened to all this with great interest; but the conversation\\r\\nsoon turned to Rogojin and his visit, and this theme proved of the\\r\\ngreatest attraction to both Totski and the general.\\r\\n\\r\\nPtitsin was able to afford some particulars as to Rogojinâ\\x80\\x99s conduct\\r\\nsince the afternoon. He declared that he had been busy finding money\\r\\nfor the latter ever since, and up to nine oâ\\x80\\x99clock, Rogojin having\\r\\ndeclared that he must absolutely have a hundred thousand roubles by the\\r\\nevening. He added that Rogojin was drunk, of course; but that he\\r\\nthought the money would be forthcoming, for the excited and intoxicated\\r\\nrapture of the fellow impelled him to give any interest or premium that\\r\\nwas asked of him, and there were several others engaged in beating up\\r\\nthe money, also.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this news was received by the company with somewhat gloomy\\r\\ninterest. Nastasia was silent, and would not say what she thought about\\r\\nit. Gania was equally uncommunicative. The general seemed the most\\r\\nanxious of all, and decidedly uneasy. The present of pearls which he\\r\\nhad prepared with so much joy in the morning had been accepted but\\r\\ncoldly, and Nastasia had smiled rather disagreeably as she took it from\\r\\nhim. Ferdishenko was the only person present in good spirits.\\r\\n\\r\\nTotski himself, who had the reputation of being a capital talker, and\\r\\nwas usually the life and soul of these entertainments, was as silent as\\r\\nany on this occasion, and sat in a state of, for him, most uncommon\\r\\nperturbation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest of the guests (an old tutor or schoolmaster, goodness knows\\r\\nwhy invited; a young man, very timid, and shy and silent; a rather loud\\r\\nwoman of about forty, apparently an actress; and a very pretty,\\r\\nwell-dressed German lady who hardly said a word all the evening) not\\r\\nonly had no gift for enlivening the proceedings, but hardly knew what\\r\\nto say for themselves when addressed. Under these circumstances the\\r\\narrival of the prince came almost as a godsend.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe announcement of his name gave rise to some surprise and to some\\r\\nsmiles, especially when it became evident, from Nastasiaâ\\x80\\x99s astonished\\r\\nlook, that she had not thought of inviting him. But her astonishment\\r\\nonce over, Nastasia showed such satisfaction that all prepared to greet\\r\\nthe prince with cordial smiles of welcome.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course,â\\x80\\x9d remarked General Epanchin, â\\x80\\x9che does this out of pure\\r\\ninnocence. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a little dangerous, perhaps, to encourage this sort of\\r\\nfreedom; but it is rather a good thing that he has arrived just at this\\r\\nmoment. He may enliven us a little with his originalities.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEspecially as he asked himself,â\\x80\\x9d said Ferdishenko.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s that got to do with it?â\\x80\\x9d asked the general, who loathed\\r\\nFerdishenko.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, he must pay toll for his entrance,â\\x80\\x9d explained the latter.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHâ\\x80\\x99m! Prince Muishkin is not Ferdishenko,â\\x80\\x9d said the general,\\r\\nimpatiently. This worthy gentleman could never quite reconcile himself\\r\\nto the idea of meeting Ferdishenko in society, and on an equal footing.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh general, spare Ferdishenko!â\\x80\\x9d replied the other, smiling. â\\x80\\x9cI have\\r\\nspecial privileges.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean by special privileges?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOnce before I had the honour of stating them to the company. I will\\r\\nrepeat the explanation to-day for your excellencyâ\\x80\\x99s benefit. You see,\\r\\nexcellency, all the world is witty and clever except myself. I am\\r\\nneither. As a kind of compensation I am allowed to tell the truth, for\\r\\nit is a well-known fact that only stupid people tell â\\x80\\x98the truth.â\\x80\\x99 Added\\r\\nto this, I am a spiteful man, just because I am not clever. If I am\\r\\noffended or injured I bear it quite patiently until the man injuring me\\r\\nmeets with some misfortune. Then I remember, and take my revenge. I\\r\\nreturn the injury sevenfold, as Ivan Petrovitch Ptitsin says. (Of\\r\\ncourse he never does so himself.) Excellency, no doubt you recollect\\r\\nKryloffâ\\x80\\x99s fable, â\\x80\\x98The Lion and the Assâ\\x80\\x99? Well now, thatâ\\x80\\x99s you and I.\\r\\nThat fable was written precisely for us.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou seem to be talking nonsense again, Ferdishenko,â\\x80\\x9d growled the\\r\\ngeneral.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat is the matter, excellency? I know how to keep my place. When I\\r\\nsaid just now that we, you and I, were the lion and the ass of\\r\\nKryloffâ\\x80\\x99s fable, of course it is understood that I take the role of the\\r\\nass. Your excellency is the lion of which the fable remarks:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98A mighty lion, terror of the woods,\\r\\nWas shorn of his great prowess by old age.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I, your excellency, am the ass.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am of your opinion on that last point,â\\x80\\x9d said Ivan Fedorovitch, with\\r\\nill-concealed irritation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this was no doubt extremely coarse, and moreover it was\\r\\npremeditated, but after all Ferdishenko had persuaded everyone to\\r\\naccept him as a buffoon.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf I am admitted and tolerated here,â\\x80\\x9d he had said one day, â\\x80\\x9cit is\\r\\nsimply because I talk in this way. How can anyone possibly receive such\\r\\na man as I am? I quite understand. Now, could I, a Ferdishenko, be\\r\\nallowed to sit shoulder to shoulder with a clever man like Afanasy\\r\\nIvanovitch? There is one explanation, only one. I am given the position\\r\\nbecause it is so entirely inconceivable!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut these vulgarities seemed to please Nastasia Philipovna, although\\r\\ntoo often they were both rude and offensive. Those who wished to go to\\r\\nher house were forced to put up with Ferdishenko. Possibly the latter\\r\\nwas not mistaken in imagining that he was received simply in order to\\r\\nannoy Totski, who disliked him extremely. Gania also was often made the\\r\\nbutt of the jesterâ\\x80\\x99s sarcasms, who used this method of keeping in\\r\\nNastasia Philipovnaâ\\x80\\x99s good graces.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe prince will begin by singing us a fashionable ditty,â\\x80\\x9d remarked\\r\\nFerdishenko, and looked at the mistress of the house, to see what she\\r\\nwould say.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t think so, Ferdishenko; please be quiet,â\\x80\\x9d answered Nastasia\\r\\nPhilipovna dryly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA-ah! if he is to be under special patronage, I withdraw my claws.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Nastasia Philipovna had now risen and advanced to meet the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was so sorry to have forgotten to ask you to come, when I saw you,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nshe said, â\\x80\\x9cand I am delighted to be able to thank you personally now,\\r\\nand to express my pleasure at your resolution.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo saying she gazed into his eyes, longing to see whether she could\\r\\nmake any guess as to the explanation of his motive in coming to her\\r\\nhouse. The prince would very likely have made some reply to her kind\\r\\nwords, but he was so dazzled by her appearance that he could not speak.\\r\\n\\r\\nNastasia noticed this with satisfaction. She was in full dress this\\r\\nevening; and her appearance was certainly calculated to impress all\\r\\nbeholders. She took his hand and led him towards her other guests. But\\r\\njust before they reached the drawing-room door, the prince stopped her,\\r\\nand hurriedly and in great agitation whispered to her:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are altogether perfection; even your pallor and thinness are\\r\\nperfect; one could not wish you otherwise. I did so wish to come and\\r\\nsee you. Iâ\\x80\\x94forgive me, pleaseâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t apologize,â\\x80\\x9d said Nastasia, laughing; â\\x80\\x9cyou spoil the whole\\r\\noriginality of the thing. I think what they say about you must be true,\\r\\nthat you are so original.â\\x80\\x94So you think me perfection, do you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHâ\\x80\\x99m! Well, you may be a good reader of riddles but you are wrong\\r\\n_there_, at all events. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll remind you of this, tonight.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNastasia introduced the prince to her guests, to most of whom he was\\r\\nalready known.\\r\\n\\r\\nTotski immediately made some amiable remark. All seemed to brighten up\\r\\nat once, and the conversation became general. Nastasia made the prince\\r\\nsit down next to herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDear me, thereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing so very curious about the prince dropping in,\\r\\nafter all,â\\x80\\x9d remarked Ferdishenko.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s quite a clear case,â\\x80\\x9d said the hitherto silent Gania. â\\x80\\x9cI have\\r\\nwatched the prince almost all day, ever since the moment when he first\\r\\nsaw Nastasia Philipovnaâ\\x80\\x99s portrait, at General Epanchinâ\\x80\\x99s. I remember\\r\\nthinking at the time what I am now pretty sure of; and what, I may say\\r\\nin passing, the prince confessed to myself.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nGania said all this perfectly seriously, and without the slightest\\r\\nappearance of joking; indeed, he seemed strangely gloomy.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI did not confess anything to you,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, blushing. â\\x80\\x9cI only\\r\\nanswered your question.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBravo! Thatâ\\x80\\x99s frank, at any rate!â\\x80\\x9d shouted Ferdishenko, and there was\\r\\ngeneral laughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh prince, prince! I never should have thought it of you;â\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nGeneral Epanchin. â\\x80\\x9cAnd I imagined you a philosopher! Oh, you silent\\r\\nfellows!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cJudging from the fact that the prince blushed at this innocent joke,\\r\\nlike a young girl, I should think that he must, as an honourable man,\\r\\nharbour the noblest intentions,â\\x80\\x9d said the old toothless schoolmaster,\\r\\nmost unexpectedly; he had not so much as opened his mouth before. This\\r\\nremark provoked general mirth, and the old fellow himself laughed\\r\\nloudest of the lot, but ended with a stupendous fit of coughing.\\r\\n\\r\\nNastasia Philipovna, who loved originality and drollery of all kinds,\\r\\nwas apparently very fond of this old man, and rang the bell for more\\r\\ntea to stop his coughing. It was now half-past ten oâ\\x80\\x99clock.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGentlemen, wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t you like a little champagne now?â\\x80\\x9d she asked. â\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nhave it all ready; it will cheer us upâ\\x80\\x94do nowâ\\x80\\x94no ceremony!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis invitation to drink, couched, as it was, in such informal terms,\\r\\ncame very strangely from Nastasia Philipovna. Her usual entertainments\\r\\nwere not quite like this; there was more style about them. However, the\\r\\nwine was not refused; each guest took a glass excepting Gania, who\\r\\ndrank nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was extremely difficult to account for Nastasiaâ\\x80\\x99s strange condition\\r\\nof mind, which became more evident each moment, and which none could\\r\\navoid noticing.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe took her glass, and vowed she would empty it three times that\\r\\nevening. She was hysterical, and laughed aloud every other minute with\\r\\nno apparent reasonâ\\x80\\x94the next moment relapsing into gloom and\\r\\nthoughtfulness.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of her guests suspected that she must be ill; but concluded at\\r\\nlast that she was expecting something, for she continued to look at her\\r\\nwatch impatiently and unceasingly; she was most absent and strange.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou seem to be a little feverish tonight,â\\x80\\x9d said the actress.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes; I feel quite ill. I have been obliged to put on this shawlâ\\x80\\x94I feel\\r\\nso cold,â\\x80\\x9d replied Nastasia. She certainly had grown very pale, and\\r\\nevery now and then she tried to suppress a trembling in her limbs.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHad we not better allow our hostess to retire?â\\x80\\x9d asked Totski of the\\r\\ngeneral.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot at all, gentlemen, not at all! Your presence is absolutely\\r\\nnecessary to me tonight,â\\x80\\x9d said Nastasia, significantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs most of those present were aware that this evening a certain very\\r\\nimportant decision was to be taken, these words of Nastasia\\r\\nPhilipovnaâ\\x80\\x99s appeared to be fraught with much hidden interest. The\\r\\ngeneral and Totski exchanged looks; Gania fidgeted convulsively in his\\r\\nchair.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLetâ\\x80\\x99s play at some game!â\\x80\\x9d suggested the actress.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know a new and most delightful game, added Ferdishenko.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat is it?â\\x80\\x9d asked the actress.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, when we tried it we were a party of people, like this, for\\r\\ninstance; and somebody proposed that each of us, without leaving his\\r\\nplace at the table, should relate something about himself. It had to be\\r\\nsomething that he really and honestly considered the very worst action\\r\\nhe had ever committed in his life. But he was to be honestâ\\x80\\x94that was the\\r\\nchief point! He wasnâ\\x80\\x99t to be allowed to lie.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat an extraordinary idea!â\\x80\\x9d said the general.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s the beauty of it, general!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a funny notion,â\\x80\\x9d said Totski, â\\x80\\x9cand yet quite naturalâ\\x80\\x94itâ\\x80\\x99s only a\\r\\nnew way of boasting.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPerhaps that is just what was so fascinating about it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, it would be a game to cry overâ\\x80\\x94not to laugh at!â\\x80\\x9d said the\\r\\nactress.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDid it succeed?â\\x80\\x9d asked Nastasia Philipovna. â\\x80\\x9cCome, letâ\\x80\\x99s try it, letâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ntry it; we really are not quite so jolly as we might beâ\\x80\\x94letâ\\x80\\x99s try it!\\r\\nWe may like it; itâ\\x80\\x99s original, at all events!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d said Ferdishenko; â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s a good ideaâ\\x80\\x94come alongâ\\x80\\x94the men begin. Of\\r\\ncourse no one need tell a story if he prefers to be disobliging. We\\r\\nmust draw lots! Throw your slips of paper, gentlemen, into this hat,\\r\\nand the prince shall draw for turns. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a very simple game; all you\\r\\nhave to do is to tell the story of the worst action of your life. Itâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nas simple as anything. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll prompt anyone who forgets the rules!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one liked the idea much. Some smiled, some frowned; some objected,\\r\\nbut faintly, not wishing to oppose Nastasiaâ\\x80\\x99s wishes; for this new idea\\r\\nseemed to be rather well received by her. She was still in an excited,\\r\\nhysterical state, laughing convulsively at nothing and everything. Her\\r\\neyes were blazing, and her cheeks showed two bright red spots against\\r\\nthe white. The melancholy appearance of some of her guests seemed to\\r\\nadd to her sarcastic humour, and perhaps the very cynicism and cruelty\\r\\nof the game proposed by Ferdishenko pleased her. At all events she was\\r\\nattracted by the idea, and gradually her guests came round to her side;\\r\\nthe thing was original, at least, and might turn out to be amusing.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd supposing itâ\\x80\\x99s something that oneâ\\x80\\x94one canâ\\x80\\x99t speak about before\\r\\nladies?â\\x80\\x9d asked the timid and silent young man.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, then of course, you wonâ\\x80\\x99t say anything about it. As if there are\\r\\nnot plenty of sins to your score without the need of those!â\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nFerdishenko.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut I really donâ\\x80\\x99t know which of my actions is the worst,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\r\\nlively actress.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLadies are exempted if they like.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd how are you to know that one isnâ\\x80\\x99t lying? And if one lies the\\r\\nwhole point of the game is lost,â\\x80\\x9d said Gania.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, but think how delightful to hear how oneâ\\x80\\x99s friends lie! Besides\\r\\nyou neednâ\\x80\\x99t be afraid, Gania; everybody knows what your worst action is\\r\\nwithout the need of any lying on your part. Only think, gentlemen,â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94and\\r\\nFerdishenko here grew quite enthusiastic, â\\x80\\x9conly think with what eyes we\\r\\nshall observe one another tomorrow, after our tales have been told!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut surely this is a joke, Nastasia Philipovna?â\\x80\\x9d asked Totski. â\\x80\\x9cYou\\r\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t really mean us to play this game.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhoever is afraid of wolves had better not go into the wood,â\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nNastasia, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut, pardon me, Mr. Ferdishenko, is it possible to make a game out of\\r\\nthis kind of thing?â\\x80\\x9d persisted Totski, growing more and more uneasy. â\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nassure you it canâ\\x80\\x99t be a success.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd why not? Why, the last time I simply told straight off about how I\\r\\nstole three roubles.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPerhaps so; but it is hardly possible that you told it so that it\\r\\nseemed like truth, or so that you were believed. And, as Gavrila\\r\\nArdalionovitch has said, the least suggestion of a falsehood takes all\\r\\npoint out of the game. It seems to me that sincerity, on the other\\r\\nhand, is only possible if combined with a kind of bad taste that would\\r\\nbe utterly out of place here.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow subtle you are, Afanasy Ivanovitch! You astonish me,â\\x80\\x9d cried\\r\\nFerdishenko. â\\x80\\x9cYou will remark, gentlemen, that in saying that I could\\r\\nnot recount the story of my theft so as to be believed, Afanasy\\r\\nIvanovitch has very ingeniously implied that I am not capable of\\r\\nthievingâ\\x80\\x94(it would have been bad taste to say so openly); and all the\\r\\ntime he is probably firmly convinced, in his own mind, that I am very\\r\\nwell capable of it! But now, gentlemen, to business! Put in your slips,\\r\\nladies and gentlemenâ\\x80\\x94is yours in, Mr. Totski? Soâ\\x80\\x94then we are all ready;\\r\\nnow prince, draw, please.â\\x80\\x9d The prince silently put his hand into the\\r\\nhat, and drew the names. Ferdishenko was first, then Ptitsin, then the\\r\\ngeneral, Totski next, his own fifth, then Gania, and so on; the ladies\\r\\ndid not draw.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, dear! oh, dear!â\\x80\\x9d cried Ferdishenko. â\\x80\\x9cI did so hope the prince\\r\\nwould come out first, and then the general. Well, gentlemen, I suppose\\r\\nI must set a good example! What vexes me much is that I am such an\\r\\ninsignificant creature that it matters nothing to anybody whether I\\r\\nhave done bad actions or not! Besides, which am I to choose? Itâ\\x80\\x99s an\\r\\n_embarras de richesse_. Shall I tell how I became a thief on one\\r\\noccasion only, to convince Afanasy Ivanovitch that it is possible to\\r\\nsteal without being a thief?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo go on, Ferdishenko, and donâ\\x80\\x99t make unnecessary preface, or youâ\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\nnever finish,â\\x80\\x9d said Nastasia Philipovna. All observed how irritable and\\r\\ncross she had become since her last burst of laughter; but none the\\r\\nless obstinately did she stick to her absurd whim about this new game.\\r\\nTotski sat looking miserable enough. The general lingered over his\\r\\nchampagne, and seemed to be thinking of some story for the time when\\r\\nhis turn should come.\\r\\n\\r\\nXIV.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have no wit, Nastasia Philipovna,â\\x80\\x9d began Ferdishenko, â\\x80\\x9cand therefore\\r\\nI talk too much, perhaps. Were I as witty, now, as Mr. Totski or the\\r\\ngeneral, I should probably have sat silent all the evening, as they\\r\\nhave. Now, prince, what do you think?â\\x80\\x94are there not far more thieves\\r\\nthan honest men in this world? Donâ\\x80\\x99t you think we may say there does\\r\\nnot exist a single person so honest that he has never stolen anything\\r\\nwhatever in his life?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat a silly idea,â\\x80\\x9d said the actress. â\\x80\\x9cOf course it is not the case. I\\r\\nhave never stolen anything, for one.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHâ\\x80\\x99m! very well, Daria Alexeyevna; you have not stolen anythingâ\\x80\\x94agreed.\\r\\nBut how about the prince, nowâ\\x80\\x94look how he is blushing!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think you are partially right, but you exaggerate,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince,\\r\\nwho had certainly blushed up, of a sudden, for some reason or other.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFerdishenkoâ\\x80\\x94either tell us your story, or be quiet, and mind your own\\r\\nbusiness. You exhaust all patience,â\\x80\\x9d cuttingly and irritably remarked\\r\\nNastasia Philipovna.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cImmediately, immediately! As for my story, gentlemen, it is too stupid\\r\\nand absurd to tell you.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI assure you I am not a thief, and yet I have stolen; I cannot explain\\r\\nwhy. It was at Semeon Ivanovitch Ishenkaâ\\x80\\x99s country house, one Sunday.\\r\\nHe had a dinner party. After dinner the men stayed at the table over\\r\\ntheir wine. It struck me to ask the daughter of the house to play\\r\\nsomething on the piano; so I passed through the corner room to join the\\r\\nladies. In that room, on Maria Ivanovnaâ\\x80\\x99s writing-table, I observed a\\r\\nthree-rouble note. She must have taken it out for some purpose, and\\r\\nleft it lying there. There was no one about. I took up the note and put\\r\\nit in my pocket; why, I canâ\\x80\\x99t say. I donâ\\x80\\x99t know what possessed me to do\\r\\nit, but it was done, and I went quickly back to the dining-room and\\r\\nreseated myself at the dinner-table. I sat and waited there in a great\\r\\nstate of excitement. I talked hard, and told lots of stories, and\\r\\nlaughed like mad; then I joined the ladies.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn half an hour or so the loss was discovered, and the servants were\\r\\nbeing put under examination. Daria, the housemaid was suspected. I\\r\\nexhibited the greatest interest and sympathy, and I remember that poor\\r\\nDaria quite lost her head, and that I began assuring her, before\\r\\neveryone, that I would guarantee her forgiveness on the part of her\\r\\nmistress, if she would confess her guilt. They all stared at the girl,\\r\\nand I remember a wonderful attraction in the reflection that here was I\\r\\nsermonizing away, with the money in my own pocket all the while. I went\\r\\nand spent the three roubles that very evening at a restaurant. I went\\r\\nin and asked for a bottle of Lafite, and drank it up; I wanted to be\\r\\nrid of the money.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI did not feel much remorse either then or afterwards; but I would not\\r\\nrepeat the performanceâ\\x80\\x94believe it or not as you please. Thereâ\\x80\\x94thatâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nall.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOnly, of course thatâ\\x80\\x99s not nearly your worst action,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\r\\nactress, with evident dislike in her face.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat was a psychological phenomenon, not an action,â\\x80\\x9d remarked Totski.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd what about the maid?â\\x80\\x9d asked Nastasia Philipovna, with undisguised\\r\\ncontempt.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, she was turned out next day, of course. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a very strict\\r\\nhousehold, there!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd you allowed it?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI should think so, rather! I was not going to return and confess next\\r\\nday,â\\x80\\x9d laughed Ferdishenko, who seemed a little surprised at the\\r\\ndisagreeable impression which his story had made on all parties.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow mean you were!â\\x80\\x9d said Nastasia.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBah! you wish to hear a man tell of his worst actions, and you expect\\r\\nthe story to come out goody-goody! Oneâ\\x80\\x99s worst actions always are mean.\\r\\nWe shall see what the general has to say for himself now. All is not\\r\\ngold that glitters, you know; and because a man keeps his carriage he\\r\\nneed not be specially virtuous, I assure you, all sorts of people keep\\r\\ncarriages. And by what means?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a word, Ferdishenko was very angry and rapidly forgetting himself;\\r\\nhis whole face was drawn with passion. Strange as it may appear, he had\\r\\nexpected much better success for his story. These little errors of\\r\\ntaste on Ferdishenkoâ\\x80\\x99s part occurred very frequently. Nastasia trembled\\r\\nwith rage, and looked fixedly at him, whereupon he relapsed into\\r\\nalarmed silence. He realized that he had gone a little too far.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHad we not better end this game?â\\x80\\x9d asked Totski.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s my turn, but I plead exemption,â\\x80\\x9d said Ptitsin.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou donâ\\x80\\x99t care to oblige us?â\\x80\\x9d asked Nastasia.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI cannot, I assure you. I confess I do not understand how anyone can\\r\\nplay this game.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen, general, itâ\\x80\\x99s your turn,â\\x80\\x9d continued Nastasia Philipovna, â\\x80\\x9cand if\\r\\nyou refuse, the whole game will fall through, which will disappoint me\\r\\nvery much, for I was looking forward to relating a certain â\\x80\\x98page of my\\r\\nown life.â\\x80\\x99 I am only waiting for you and Afanasy Ivanovitch to have\\r\\nyour turns, for I require the support of your example,â\\x80\\x9d she added,\\r\\nsmiling.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, if you put it in that way,â\\x80\\x9d cried the general, excitedly, â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m\\r\\nready to tell the whole story of my life, but I must confess that I\\r\\nprepared a little story in anticipation of my turn.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNastasia smiled amiably at him; but evidently her depression and\\r\\nirritability were increasing with every moment. Totski was dreadfully\\r\\nalarmed to hear her promise a revelation out of her own life.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI, like everyone else,â\\x80\\x9d began the general, â\\x80\\x9chave committed certain not\\r\\naltogether graceful actions, so to speak, during the course of my life.\\r\\nBut the strangest thing of all in my case is, that I should consider\\r\\nthe little anecdote which I am now about to give you as a confession of\\r\\nthe worst of my â\\x80\\x98bad actions.â\\x80\\x99 It is thirty-five years since it all\\r\\nhappened, and yet I cannot to this very day recall the circumstances\\r\\nwithout, as it were, a sudden pang at the heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was a silly affairâ\\x80\\x94I was an ensign at the time. You know\\r\\nensignsâ\\x80\\x94their blood is boiling water, their circumstances generally\\r\\npenurious. Well, I had a servant Nikifor who used to do everything for\\r\\nme in my quarters, economized and managed for me, and even laid hands\\r\\non anything he could find (belonging to other people), in order to\\r\\naugment our household goods; but a faithful, honest fellow all the\\r\\nsame.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was strict, but just by nature. At that time we were stationed in a\\r\\nsmall town. I was quartered at an old widowâ\\x80\\x99s house, a lieutenantâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nwidow of eighty years of age. She lived in a wretched little wooden\\r\\nhouse, and had not even a servant, so poor was she.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHer relations had all died offâ\\x80\\x94her husband was dead and buried forty\\r\\nyears since; and a niece, who had lived with her and bullied her up to\\r\\nthree years ago, was dead too; so that she was quite alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, I was precious dull with her, especially as she was so childish\\r\\nthat there was nothing to be got out of her. Eventually, she stole a\\r\\nfowl of mine; the business is a mystery to this day; but it could have\\r\\nbeen no one but herself. I requested to be quartered somewhere else,\\r\\nand was shifted to the other end of the town, to the house of a\\r\\nmerchant with a large family, and a long beard, as I remember him.\\r\\nNikifor and I were delighted to go; but the old lady was not pleased at\\r\\nour departure.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, a day or two afterwards, when I returned from drill, Nikifor\\r\\nsays to me: â\\x80\\x98We oughtnâ\\x80\\x99t to have left our tureen with the old lady,\\r\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ve nothing to serve the soup in.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI asked how it came about that the tureen had been left. Nikifor\\r\\nexplained that the old lady refused to give it up, because, she said,\\r\\nwe had broken her bowl, and she must have our tureen in place of it;\\r\\nshe had declared that I had so arranged the matter with herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis baseness on her part of course aroused my young blood to fever\\r\\nheat; I jumped up, and away I flew.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI arrived at the old womanâ\\x80\\x99s house beside myself. She was sitting in a\\r\\ncorner all alone, leaning her face on her hand. I fell on her like a\\r\\nclap of thunder. â\\x80\\x98You old wretch!â\\x80\\x99 I yelled and all that sort of thing,\\r\\nin real Russian style. Well, when I began cursing at her, a strange\\r\\nthing happened. I looked at her, and she stared back with her eyes\\r\\nstarting out of her head, but she did not say a word. She seemed to\\r\\nsway about as she sat, and looked and looked at me in the strangest\\r\\nway. Well, I soon stopped swearing and looked closer at her, asked her\\r\\nquestions, but not a word could I get out of her. The flies were\\r\\nbuzzing about the room and only this sound broke the silence; the sun\\r\\nwas setting outside; I didnâ\\x80\\x99t know what to make of it, so I went away.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBefore I reached home I was met and summoned to the majorâ\\x80\\x99s, so that\\r\\nit was some while before I actually got there. When I came in, Nikifor\\r\\nmet me. â\\x80\\x98Have you heard, sir, that our old lady is dead?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98_dead_,\\r\\nwhen?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Oh, an hour and a half ago.â\\x80\\x99 That meant nothing more nor less\\r\\nthan that she was dying at the moment when I pounced on her and began\\r\\nabusing her.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis produced a great effect upon me. I used to dream of the poor old\\r\\nwoman at nights. I really am not superstitious, but two days after, I\\r\\nwent to her funeral, and as time went on I thought more and more about\\r\\nher. I said to myself, â\\x80\\x98This woman, this human being, lived to a great\\r\\nage. She had children, a husband and family, friends and relations; her\\r\\nhousehold was busy and cheerful; she was surrounded by smiling faces;\\r\\nand then suddenly they are gone, and she is left alone like a solitary\\r\\nfly... like a fly, cursed with the burden of her age. At last, God\\r\\ncalls her to Himself. At sunset, on a lovely summerâ\\x80\\x99s evening, my\\r\\nlittle old woman passes awayâ\\x80\\x94a thought, you will notice, which offers\\r\\nmuch food for reflectionâ\\x80\\x94and behold! instead of tears and prayers to\\r\\nstart her on her last journey, she has insults and jeers from a young\\r\\nensign, who stands before her with his hands in his pockets, making a\\r\\nterrible row about a soup tureen!â\\x80\\x99 Of course I was to blame, and even\\r\\nnow that I have time to look back at it calmly, I pity the poor old\\r\\nthing no less. I repeat that I wonder at myself, for after all I was\\r\\nnot really responsible. Why did she take it into her head to die at\\r\\nthat moment? But the more I thought of it, the more I felt the weight\\r\\nof it upon my mind; and I never got quite rid of the impression until I\\r\\nput a couple of old women into an almshouse and kept them there at my\\r\\nown expense. There, thatâ\\x80\\x99s all. I repeat I dare say I have committed\\r\\nmany a grievous sin in my day; but I cannot help always looking back\\r\\nupon this as the worst action I have ever perpetrated.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHâ\\x80\\x99m! and instead of a bad action, your excellency has detailed one of\\r\\nyour noblest deeds,â\\x80\\x9d said Ferdishenko. â\\x80\\x9cFerdishenko is â\\x80\\x98done.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDear me, general,â\\x80\\x9d said Nastasia Philipovna, absently, â\\x80\\x9cI really never\\r\\nimagined you had such a good heart.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general laughed with great satisfaction, and applied himself once\\r\\nmore to the champagne.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was now Totskiâ\\x80\\x99s turn, and his story was awaited with great\\r\\ncuriosityâ\\x80\\x94while all eyes turned on Nastasia Philipovna, as though\\r\\nanticipating that his revelation must be connected somehow with her.\\r\\nNastasia, during the whole of his story, pulled at the lace trimming of\\r\\nher sleeve, and never once glanced at the speaker. Totski was a\\r\\nhandsome man, rather stout, with a very polite and dignified manner. He\\r\\nwas always well dressed, and his linen was exquisite. He had plump\\r\\nwhite hands, and wore a magnificent diamond ring on one finger.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat simplifies the duty before me considerably, in my opinion,â\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nbegan, â\\x80\\x9cis that I am bound to recall and relate the very worst action\\r\\nof my life. In such circumstances there can, of course, be no doubt.\\r\\nOneâ\\x80\\x99s conscience very soon informs one what is the proper narrative to\\r\\ntell. I admit, that among the many silly and thoughtless actions of my\\r\\nlife, the memory of one comes prominently forward and reminds me that\\r\\nit lay long like a stone on my heart. Some twenty years since, I paid a\\r\\nvisit to Platon Ordintzeff at his country-house. He had just been\\r\\nelected marshal of the nobility, and had come there with his young wife\\r\\nfor the winter holidays. Anfisa Alexeyevnaâ\\x80\\x99s birthday came off just\\r\\nthen, too, and there were two balls arranged. At that time Dumas-filsâ\\x80\\x99\\r\\nbeautiful work, _La Dame aux CamÃ©lias_â\\x80\\x94a novel which I consider\\r\\nimperishableâ\\x80\\x94had just come into fashion. In the provinces all the\\r\\nladies were in raptures over it, those who had read it, at least.\\r\\nCamellias were all the fashion. Everyone inquired for them, everybody\\r\\nwanted them; and a grand lot of camellias are to be got in a country\\r\\ntownâ\\x80\\x94as you all knowâ\\x80\\x94and two balls to provide for!\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPoor Peter Volhofskoi was desperately in love with Anfisa Alexeyevna.\\r\\nI donâ\\x80\\x99t know whether there was anythingâ\\x80\\x94I mean I donâ\\x80\\x99t know whether he\\r\\ncould possibly have indulged in any hope. The poor fellow was beside\\r\\nhimself to get her a bouquet of camellias. Countess Sotski and Sophia\\r\\nBespalova, as everyone knew, were coming with white camellia bouquets.\\r\\nAnfisa wished for red ones, for effect. Well, her husband Platon was\\r\\ndriven desperate to find some. And the day before the ball, Anfisaâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nrival snapped up the only red camellias to be had in the place, from\\r\\nunder Platonâ\\x80\\x99s nose, and Platonâ\\x80\\x94wretched manâ\\x80\\x94was done for. Now if Peter\\r\\nhad only been able to step in at this moment with a red bouquet, his\\r\\nlittle hopes might have made gigantic strides. A womanâ\\x80\\x99s gratitude\\r\\nunder such circumstances would have been boundlessâ\\x80\\x94but it was\\r\\npractically an impossibility.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe night before the ball I met Peter, looking radiant. â\\x80\\x98What is it?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nI ask. â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99ve found them, Eureka!â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No! where, where?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98At Ekshaisk (a\\r\\nlittle town fifteen miles off) thereâ\\x80\\x99s a rich old merchant, who keeps a\\r\\nlot of canaries, has no children, and he and his wife are devoted to\\r\\nflowers. Heâ\\x80\\x99s got some camellias.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98And what if he wonâ\\x80\\x99t let you have\\r\\nthem?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99ll go on my knees and implore till I get them. I wonâ\\x80\\x99t go\\r\\naway.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98When shall you start?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Tomorrow morning at five oâ\\x80\\x99clock.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Go\\r\\non,â\\x80\\x99 I said, â\\x80\\x98and good luck to you.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was glad for the poor fellow, and went home. But an idea got hold of\\r\\nme somehow. I donâ\\x80\\x99t know how. It was nearly two in the morning. I rang\\r\\nthe bell and ordered the coachman to be waked up and sent to me. He\\r\\ncame. I gave him a tip of fifteen roubles, and told him to get the\\r\\ncarriage ready at once. In half an hour it was at the door. I got in\\r\\nand off we went.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBy five I drew up at the Ekshaisky inn. I waited there till dawn, and\\r\\nsoon after six I was off, and at the old merchant Trepalafâ\\x80\\x99s.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Camellias!â\\x80\\x99 I said, â\\x80\\x98father, save me, save me, let me have some\\r\\ncamellias!â\\x80\\x99 He was a tall, grey old manâ\\x80\\x94a terrible-looking old\\r\\ngentleman. â\\x80\\x98Not a bit of it,â\\x80\\x99 he says. â\\x80\\x98I wonâ\\x80\\x99t.â\\x80\\x99 Down I went on my\\r\\nknees. â\\x80\\x98Donâ\\x80\\x99t say so, donâ\\x80\\x99tâ\\x80\\x94think what youâ\\x80\\x99re doing!â\\x80\\x99 I cried; â\\x80\\x98itâ\\x80\\x99s a\\r\\nmatter of life and death!â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98If thatâ\\x80\\x99s the case, take them,â\\x80\\x99 says he. So\\r\\nup I get, and cut such a bouquet of red camellias! He had a whole\\r\\ngreenhouse full of themâ\\x80\\x94lovely ones. The old fellow sighs. I pull out a\\r\\nhundred roubles. â\\x80\\x98No, no!â\\x80\\x99 says he, â\\x80\\x98donâ\\x80\\x99t insult me that way.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Oh, if\\r\\nthatâ\\x80\\x99s the case, give it to the village hospital,â\\x80\\x99 I say. â\\x80\\x98Ah,â\\x80\\x99 he\\r\\nsays, â\\x80\\x98thatâ\\x80\\x99s quite a different matter; thatâ\\x80\\x99s good of you and\\r\\ngenerous. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll pay it in there for you with pleasure.â\\x80\\x99 I liked that old\\r\\nfellow, Russian to the core, _de la vraie souche_. I went home in\\r\\nraptures, but took another road in order to avoid Peter. Immediately on\\r\\narriving I sent up the bouquet for Anfisa to see when she awoke.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou may imagine her ecstasy, her gratitude. The wretched Platon, who\\r\\nhad almost died since yesterday of the reproaches showered upon him,\\r\\nwept on my shoulder. Of course poor Peter had no chance after this.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI thought he would cut my throat at first, and went about armed ready\\r\\nto meet him. But he took it differently; he fainted, and had brain\\r\\nfever and convulsions. A month after, when he had hardly recovered, he\\r\\nwent off to the Crimea, and there he was shot.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI assure you this business left me no peace for many a long year. Why\\r\\ndid I do it? I was not in love with her myself; Iâ\\x80\\x99m afraid it was\\r\\nsimply mischiefâ\\x80\\x94pure â\\x80\\x98cussednessâ\\x80\\x99 on my part.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf I hadnâ\\x80\\x99t seized that bouquet from under his nose he might have been\\r\\nalive now, and a happy man. He might have been successful in life, and\\r\\nnever have gone to fight the Turks.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTotski ended his tale with the same dignity that had characterized its\\r\\ncommencement.\\r\\n\\r\\nNastasia Philipovnaâ\\x80\\x99s eyes were flashing in a most unmistakable way,\\r\\nnow; and her lips were all a-quiver by the time Totski finished his\\r\\nstory.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll present watched both of them with curiosity.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou were right, Totski,â\\x80\\x9d said Nastasia, â\\x80\\x9cit is a dull game and a\\r\\nstupid one. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll just tell my story, as I promised, and then weâ\\x80\\x99ll play\\r\\ncards.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, but letâ\\x80\\x99s have the story first!â\\x80\\x9d cried the general.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPrince,â\\x80\\x9d said Nastasia Philipovna, unexpectedly turning to Muishkin,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9chere are my old friends, Totski and General Epanchin, who wish to\\r\\nmarry me off. Tell me what you think. Shall I marry or not? As you\\r\\ndecide, so shall it be.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTotski grew white as a sheet. The general was struck dumb. All present\\r\\nstarted and listened intently. Gania sat rooted to his chair.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMarry whom?â\\x80\\x9d asked the prince, faintly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGavrila Ardalionovitch Ivolgin,â\\x80\\x9d said Nastasia, firmly and evenly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were a few seconds of dead silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince tried to speak, but could not form his words; a great weight\\r\\nseemed to lie upon his breast and suffocate him.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cN-no! donâ\\x80\\x99t marry him!â\\x80\\x9d he whispered at last, drawing his breath with\\r\\nan effort.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo be it, then. Gavrila Ardalionovitch,â\\x80\\x9d she spoke solemnly and\\r\\nforcibly, â\\x80\\x9cyou hear the princeâ\\x80\\x99s decision? Take it as my decision; and\\r\\nlet that be the end of the matter for good and all.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNastasia Philipovna!â\\x80\\x9d cried Totski, in a quaking voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNastasia Philipovna!â\\x80\\x9d said the general, in persuasive but agitated\\r\\ntones.\\r\\n\\r\\nEveryone in the room fidgeted in their places, and waited to see what\\r\\nwas coming next.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, gentlemen!â\\x80\\x9d she continued, gazing around in apparent\\r\\nastonishment; â\\x80\\x9cwhat do you all look so alarmed about? Why are you so\\r\\nupset?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cButâ\\x80\\x94recollect, Nastasia Philipovna,â\\x80\\x9d stammered Totski, â\\x80\\x9cyou gave a\\r\\npromise, quite a free one, andâ\\x80\\x94and you might have spared us this. I am\\r\\nconfused and bewildered, I know; but, in a word, at such a moment, and\\r\\nbefore company, and all so-so-irregular, finishing off a game with a\\r\\nserious matter like this, a matter of honour, and of heart, andâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t follow you, Afanasy Ivanovitch; you are losing your head. In\\r\\nthe first place, what do you mean by â\\x80\\x98before companyâ\\x80\\x99? Isnâ\\x80\\x99t the\\r\\ncompany good enough for you? And whatâ\\x80\\x99s all that about â\\x80\\x98a gameâ\\x80\\x99? I\\r\\nwished to tell my little story, and I told it! Donâ\\x80\\x99t you like it? You\\r\\nheard what I said to the prince? â\\x80\\x98As you decide, so it shall be!â\\x80\\x99 If he\\r\\nhad said â\\x80\\x98yes,â\\x80\\x99 I should have given my consent! But he said â\\x80\\x98no,â\\x80\\x99 so I\\r\\nrefused. Here was my whole life hanging on his one word! Surely I was\\r\\nserious enough?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe prince! What on earth has the prince got to do with it? Who the\\r\\ndeuce is the prince?â\\x80\\x9d cried the general, who could conceal his wrath no\\r\\nlonger.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe prince has this to do with itâ\\x80\\x94that I see in him for the first time\\r\\nin all my life, a man endowed with real truthfulness of spirit, and I\\r\\ntrust him. He trusted me at first sight, and I trust him!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt only remains for me, then, to thank Nastasia Philipovna for the\\r\\ngreat delicacy with which she has treated me,â\\x80\\x9d said Gania, as pale as\\r\\ndeath, and with quivering lips. â\\x80\\x9cThat is my plain duty, of course; but\\r\\nthe princeâ\\x80\\x94what has he to do in the matter?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI see what you are driving at,â\\x80\\x9d said Nastasia Philipovna. â\\x80\\x9cYou imply\\r\\nthat the prince is after the seventy-five thousand roublesâ\\x80\\x94I quite\\r\\nunderstand you. Mr. Totski, I forgot to say, â\\x80\\x98Take your seventy-five\\r\\nthousand roublesâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x94I donâ\\x80\\x99t want them. I let you go free for nothingâ\\x80\\x94take\\r\\nyour freedom! You must need it. Nine years and three monthsâ\\x80\\x99 captivity\\r\\nis enough for anybody. Tomorrow I shall start afreshâ\\x80\\x94today I am a free\\r\\nagent for the first time in my life.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGeneral, you must take your pearls back, tooâ\\x80\\x94give them to your\\r\\nwifeâ\\x80\\x94here they are! Tomorrow I shall leave this flat altogether, and\\r\\nthen thereâ\\x80\\x99ll be no more of these pleasant little social gatherings,\\r\\nladies and gentlemen.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo saying, she scornfully rose from her seat as though to depart.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNastasia Philipovna! Nastasia Philipovna!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe words burst involuntarily from every mouth. All present started up\\r\\nin bewildered excitement; all surrounded her; all had listened uneasily\\r\\nto her wild, disconnected sentences. All felt that something had\\r\\nhappened, something had gone very far wrong indeed, but no one could\\r\\nmake head or tail of the matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this moment there was a furious ring at the bell, and a great knock\\r\\nat the doorâ\\x80\\x94exactly similar to the one which had startled the company\\r\\nat Ganiaâ\\x80\\x99s house in the afternoon.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, ah! hereâ\\x80\\x99s the climax at last, at half-past twelve!â\\x80\\x9d cried\\r\\nNastasia Philipovna. â\\x80\\x9cSit down, gentlemen, I beg you. Something is\\r\\nabout to happen.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo saying, she reseated herself; a strange smile played on her lips.\\r\\nShe sat quite still, but watched the door in a fever of impatience.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cRogojin and his hundred thousand roubles, no doubt of it,â\\x80\\x9d muttered\\r\\nPtitsin to himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nXV.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatia, the maid-servant, made her appearance, terribly frightened.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGoodness knows what it means, maâ\\x80\\x99am,â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cThere is a whole\\r\\ncollection of men comeâ\\x80\\x94all tipsyâ\\x80\\x94and want to see you. They say that\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98itâ\\x80\\x99s Rogojin, and she knows all about it.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s all right, Katia, let them all in at once.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSurely not _all_, maâ\\x80\\x99am? They seem so disorderlyâ\\x80\\x94itâ\\x80\\x99s dreadful to see\\r\\nthem.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes _all_, Katia, allâ\\x80\\x94every one of them. Let them in, or theyâ\\x80\\x99ll come\\r\\nin whether you like or no. Listen! what a noise they are making!\\r\\nPerhaps you are offended, gentlemen, that I should receive such guests\\r\\nin your presence? I am very sorry, and ask your forgiveness, but it\\r\\ncannot be helpedâ\\x80\\x94and I should be very grateful if you could all stay\\r\\nand witness this climax. However, just as you please, of course.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe guests exchanged glances; they were annoyed and bewildered by the\\r\\nepisode; but it was clear enough that all this had been pre-arranged\\r\\nand expected by Nastasia Philipovna, and that there was no use in\\r\\ntrying to stop her nowâ\\x80\\x94for she was little short of insane.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides, they were naturally inquisitive to see what was to happen.\\r\\nThere was nobody who would be likely to feel much alarm. There were but\\r\\ntwo ladies present; one of whom was the lively actress, who was not\\r\\neasily frightened, and the other the silent German beauty who, it\\r\\nturned out, did not understand a word of Russian, and seemed to be as\\r\\nstupid as she was lovely.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer acquaintances invited her to their â\\x80\\x9cAt Homesâ\\x80\\x9d because she was so\\r\\ndecorative. She was exhibited to their guests like a valuable picture,\\r\\nor vase, or statue, or firescreen. As for the men, Ptitsin was one of\\r\\nRogojinâ\\x80\\x99s friends; Ferdishenko was as much at home as a fish in the\\r\\nsea, Gania, not yet recovered from his amazement, appeared to be\\r\\nchained to a pillory. The old professor did not in the least understand\\r\\nwhat was happening; but when he noticed how extremely agitated the\\r\\nmistress of the house, and her friends, seemed, he nearly wept, and\\r\\ntrembled with fright: but he would rather have died than leave Nastasia\\r\\nPhilipovna at such a crisis, for he loved her as if she were his own\\r\\ngranddaughter. Afanasy Ivanovitch greatly disliked having anything to\\r\\ndo with the affair, but he was too much interested to leave, in spite\\r\\nof the mad turn things had taken; and a few words that had dropped from\\r\\nthe lips of Nastasia puzzled him so much, that he felt he could not go\\r\\nwithout an explanation. He resolved therefore, to see it out, and to\\r\\nadopt the attitude of silent spectator, as most suited to his dignity.\\r\\nGeneral Epanchin alone determined to depart. He was annoyed at the\\r\\nmanner in which his gift had been returned, as though he had\\r\\ncondescended, under the influence of passion, to place himself on a\\r\\nlevel with Ptitsin and Ferdishenko, his self-respect and sense of duty\\r\\nnow returned together with a consciousness of what was due to his\\r\\nsocial rank and official importance. In short, he plainly showed his\\r\\nconviction that a man in his position could have nothing to do with\\r\\nRogojin and his companions. But Nastasia interrupted him at his first\\r\\nwords.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, general!â\\x80\\x9d she cried, â\\x80\\x9cI was forgetting! If I had only foreseen\\r\\nthis unpleasantness! I wonâ\\x80\\x99t insist on keeping you against your will,\\r\\nalthough I should have liked you to be beside me now. In any case, I am\\r\\nmost grateful to you for your visit, and flattering attention... but if\\r\\nyou are afraid...â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExcuse me, Nastasia Philipovna,â\\x80\\x9d interrupted the general, with\\r\\nchivalric generosity. â\\x80\\x9cTo whom are you speaking? I have remained until\\r\\nnow simply because of my devotion to you, and as for danger, I am only\\r\\nafraid that the carpets may be ruined, and the furniture smashed!...\\r\\nYou should shut the door on the lot, in my opinion. But I confess that\\r\\nI am extremely curious to see how it ends.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cRogojin!â\\x80\\x9d announced Ferdishenko.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat do you think about it?â\\x80\\x9d said the general in a low voice to\\r\\nTotski. â\\x80\\x9cIs she mad? I mean mad in the medical sense of the word ....\\r\\neh?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve always said she was predisposed to it,â\\x80\\x9d whispered Afanasy\\r\\nIvanovitch slyly. â\\x80\\x9cPerhaps it is a fever!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSince their visit to Ganiaâ\\x80\\x99s home, Rogojinâ\\x80\\x99s followers had been\\r\\nincreased by two new recruitsâ\\x80\\x94a dissolute old man, the hero of some\\r\\nancient scandal, and a retired sub-lieutenant. A laughable story was\\r\\ntold of the former. He possessed, it was said, a set of false teeth,\\r\\nand one day when he wanted money for a drinking orgy, he pawned them,\\r\\nand was never able to reclaim them! The officer appeared to be a rival\\r\\nof the gentleman who was so proud of his fists. He was known to none of\\r\\nRogojinâ\\x80\\x99s followers, but as they passed by the Nevsky, where he stood\\r\\nbegging, he had joined their ranks. His claim for the charity he\\r\\ndesired seemed based on the fact that in the days of his prosperity he\\r\\nhad given away as much as fifteen roubles at a time. The rivals seemed\\r\\nmore than a little jealous of one another. The athlete appeared injured\\r\\nat the admission of the â\\x80\\x9cbeggarâ\\x80\\x9d into the company. By nature taciturn,\\r\\nhe now merely growled occasionally like a bear, and glared\\r\\ncontemptuously upon the â\\x80\\x9cbeggar,â\\x80\\x9d who, being somewhat of a man of the\\r\\nworld, and a diplomatist, tried to insinuate himself into the bearâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ngood graces. He was a much smaller man than the athlete, and doubtless\\r\\nwas conscious that he must tread warily. Gently and without argument he\\r\\nalluded to the advantages of the English style in boxing, and showed\\r\\nhimself a firm believer in Western institutions. The athleteâ\\x80\\x99s lips\\r\\ncurled disdainfully, and without honouring his adversary with a formal\\r\\ndenial, he exhibited, as if by accident, that peculiarly Russian\\r\\nobjectâ\\x80\\x94an enormous fist, clenched, muscular, and covered with red\\r\\nhairs! The sight of this pre-eminently national attribute was enough to\\r\\nconvince anybody, without words, that it was a serious matter for those\\r\\nwho should happen to come into contact with it.\\r\\n\\r\\nNone of the band were very drunk, for the leader had kept his intended\\r\\nvisit to Nastasia in view all day, and had done his best to prevent his\\r\\nfollowers from drinking too much. He was sober himself, but the\\r\\nexcitement of this chaotic dayâ\\x80\\x94the strangest day of his lifeâ\\x80\\x94had\\r\\naffected him so that he was in a dazed, wild condition, which almost\\r\\nresembled drunkenness.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had kept but one idea before him all day, and for that he had worked\\r\\nin an agony of anxiety and a fever of suspense. His lieutenants had\\r\\nworked so hard from five oâ\\x80\\x99clock until eleven, that they actually had\\r\\ncollected a hundred thousand roubles for him, but at such terrific\\r\\nexpense, that the rate of interest was only mentioned among them in\\r\\nwhispers and with bated breath.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs before, Rogojin walked in advance of his troop, who followed him\\r\\nwith mingled self-assertion and timidity. They were specially\\r\\nfrightened of Nastasia Philipovna herself, for some reason.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of them expected to be thrown downstairs at once, without further\\r\\nceremony, the elegant and irresistible Zaleshoff among them. But the\\r\\nparty led by the athlete, without openly showing their hostile\\r\\nintentions, silently nursed contempt and even hatred for Nastasia\\r\\nPhilipovna, and marched into her house as they would have marched into\\r\\nan enemyâ\\x80\\x99s fortress. Arrived there, the luxury of the rooms seemed to\\r\\ninspire them with a kind of respect, not unmixed with alarm. So many\\r\\nthings were entirely new to their experienceâ\\x80\\x94the choice furniture, the\\r\\npictures, the great statue of Venus. They followed their chief into the\\r\\nsalon, however, with a kind of impudent curiosity. There, the sight of\\r\\nGeneral Epanchin among the guests, caused many of them to beat a hasty\\r\\nretreat into the adjoining room, the â\\x80\\x9cboxerâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cbeggarâ\\x80\\x9d being among\\r\\nthe first to go. A few only, of whom Lebedeff made one, stood their\\r\\nground; he had contrived to walk side by side with Rogojin, for he\\r\\nquite understood the importance of a man who had a fortune of a million\\r\\nodd roubles, and who at this moment carried a hundred thousand in his\\r\\nhand. It may be added that the whole company, not excepting Lebedeff,\\r\\nhad the vaguest idea of the extent of their powers, and of how far they\\r\\ncould safely go. At some moments Lebedeff was sure that right was on\\r\\ntheir side; at others he tried uneasily to remember various cheering\\r\\nand reassuring articles of the Civil Code.\\r\\n\\r\\nRogojin, when he stepped into the room, and his eyes fell upon\\r\\nNastasia, stopped short, grew white as a sheet, and stood staring; it\\r\\nwas clear that his heart was beating painfully. So he stood, gazing\\r\\nintently, but timidly, for a few seconds. Suddenly, as though bereft of\\r\\nhis senses, he moved forward, staggering helplessly, towards the table.\\r\\nOn his way he collided against Ptitsinâ\\x80\\x99s chair, and put his dirty foot\\r\\non the lace skirt of the silent ladyâ\\x80\\x99s dress; but he neither apologized\\r\\nfor this, nor even noticed it.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn reaching the table, he placed upon it a strange-looking object,\\r\\nwhich he had carried with him into the drawing-room. This was a paper\\r\\npacket, some six or seven inches thick, and eight or nine in length,\\r\\nwrapped in an old newspaper, and tied round three or four times with\\r\\nstring.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving placed this before her, he stood with drooped arms and head, as\\r\\nthough awaiting his sentence.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis costume was the same as it had been in the morning, except for a\\r\\nnew silk handkerchief round his neck, bright green and red, fastened\\r\\nwith a huge diamond pin, and an enormous diamond ring on his dirty\\r\\nforefinger.\\r\\n\\r\\nLebedeff stood two or three paces behind his chief; and the rest of the\\r\\nband waited about near the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two maid-servants were both peeping in, frightened and amazed at\\r\\nthis unusual and disorderly scene.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat is that?â\\x80\\x9d asked Nastasia Philipovna, gazing intently at Rogojin,\\r\\nand indicating the paper packet.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA hundred thousand,â\\x80\\x9d replied the latter, almost in a whisper.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh! so he kept his wordâ\\x80\\x94thereâ\\x80\\x99s a man for you! Well, sit down,\\r\\npleaseâ\\x80\\x94take that chair. I shall have something to say to you presently.\\r\\nWho are all these with you? The same party? Let them come in and sit\\r\\ndown. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s room on that sofa, there are some chairs and thereâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nanother sofa! Well, why donâ\\x80\\x99t they sit down?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSure enough, some of the brave fellows entirely lost their heads at\\r\\nthis point, and retreated into the next room. Others, however, took the\\r\\nhint and sat down, as far as they could from the table, however;\\r\\nfeeling braver in proportion to their distance from Nastasia.\\r\\n\\r\\nRogojin took the chair offered him, but he did not sit long; he soon\\r\\nstood up again, and did not reseat himself. Little by little he began\\r\\nto look around him and discern the other guests. Seeing Gania, he\\r\\nsmiled venomously and muttered to himself, â\\x80\\x9cLook at that!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe gazed at Totski and the general with no apparent confusion, and with\\r\\nvery little curiosity. But when he observed that the prince was seated\\r\\nbeside Nastasia Philipovna, he could not take his eyes off him for a\\r\\nlong while, and was clearly amazed. He could not account for the\\r\\nprinceâ\\x80\\x99s presence there. It was not in the least surprising that\\r\\nRogojin should be, at this time, in a more or less delirious condition;\\r\\nfor not to speak of the excitements of the day, he had spent the night\\r\\nbefore in the train, and had not slept more than a wink for forty-eight\\r\\nhours.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis, gentlemen, is a hundred thousand roubles,â\\x80\\x9d said Nastasia\\r\\nPhilipovna, addressing the company in general, â\\x80\\x9chere, in this dirty\\r\\nparcel. This afternoon Rogojin yelled, like a madman, that he would\\r\\nbring me a hundred thousand in the evening, and I have been waiting for\\r\\nhim all the while. He was bargaining for me, you know; first he offered\\r\\nme eighteen thousand; then he rose to forty, and then to a hundred\\r\\nthousand. And he has kept his word, see! My goodness, how white he is!\\r\\nAll this happened this afternoon, at Ganiaâ\\x80\\x99s. I had gone to pay his\\r\\nmother a visitâ\\x80\\x94my future family, you know! And his sister said to my\\r\\nvery face, surely somebody will turn this shameless creature out. After\\r\\nwhich she spat in her brother Ganiaâ\\x80\\x99s faceâ\\x80\\x94a girl of character, that!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNastasia Philipovna!â\\x80\\x9d began the general, reproachfully. He was\\r\\nbeginning to put his own interpretation on the affair.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, what, general? Not quite good form, eh? Oh, nonsense! Here have\\r\\nI been sitting in my box at the French theatre for the last five years\\r\\nlike a statue of inaccessible virtue, and kept out of the way of all\\r\\nadmirers, like a silly little idiot! Now, thereâ\\x80\\x99s this man, who comes\\r\\nand pays down his hundred thousand on the table, before you all, in\\r\\nspite of my five years of innocence and proud virtue, and I dare be\\r\\nsworn he has his sledge outside waiting to carry me off. He values me\\r\\nat a hundred thousand! I see you are still angry with me, Gania! Why,\\r\\nsurely you never really wished to take _me_ into your family? _me_,\\r\\nRogojinâ\\x80\\x99s mistress! What did the prince say just now?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI never said you were Rogojinâ\\x80\\x99s mistressâ\\x80\\x94you are _not!_â\\x80\\x9d said the\\r\\nprince, in trembling accents.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNastasia Philipovna, dear soul!â\\x80\\x9d cried the actress, impatiently, â\\x80\\x9cdo\\r\\nbe calm, dear! If it annoys you soâ\\x80\\x94all thisâ\\x80\\x94do go away and rest! Of\\r\\ncourse you would never go with this wretched fellow, in spite of his\\r\\nhundred thousand roubles! Take his money and kick him out of the house;\\r\\nthatâ\\x80\\x99s the way to treat him and the likes of him! Upon my word, if it\\r\\nwere my business, Iâ\\x80\\x99d soon clear them all out!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe actress was a kind-hearted woman, and highly impressionable. She\\r\\nwas very angry now.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t be cross, Daria Alexeyevna!â\\x80\\x9d laughed Nastasia. â\\x80\\x9cI was not angry\\r\\nwhen I spoke; I wasnâ\\x80\\x99t reproaching Gania. I donâ\\x80\\x99t know how it was that\\r\\nI ever could have indulged the whim of entering an honest family like\\r\\nhis. I saw his motherâ\\x80\\x94and kissed her hand, too. I came and stirred up\\r\\nall that fuss, Gania, this afternoon, on purpose to see how much you\\r\\ncould swallowâ\\x80\\x94you surprised me, my friendâ\\x80\\x94you did, indeed. Surely you\\r\\ncould not marry a woman who accepts pearls like those you knew the\\r\\ngeneral was going to give me, on the very eve of her marriage? And\\r\\nRogojin! Why, in your own house and before your own brother and sister,\\r\\nhe bargained with me! Yet you could come here and expect to be\\r\\nbetrothed to me before you left the house! You almost brought your\\r\\nsister, too. Surely what Rogojin said about you is not really true:\\r\\nthat you would crawl all the way to the other end of the town, on hands\\r\\nand knees, for three roubles?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, he would!â\\x80\\x9d said Rogojin, quietly, but with an air of absolute\\r\\nconviction.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHâ\\x80\\x99m! and he receives a good salary, Iâ\\x80\\x99m told. Well, what should you\\r\\nget but disgrace and misery if you took a wife you hated into your\\r\\nfamily (for I know very well that you do hate me)? No, no! I believe\\r\\nnow that a man like you would murder anyone for moneyâ\\x80\\x94sharpen a razor\\r\\nand come up behind his best friend and cut his throat like a sheepâ\\x80\\x94Iâ\\x80\\x99ve\\r\\nread of such people. Everyone seems money-mad nowadays. No, no! I may\\r\\nbe shameless, but you are far worse. I donâ\\x80\\x99t say a word about that\\r\\notherâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNastasia Philipovna, is this really you? You, once so refined and\\r\\ndelicate of speech. Oh, what a tongue! What dreadful things you are\\r\\nsaying,â\\x80\\x9d cried the general, wringing his hands in real grief.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am intoxicated, general. I am having a day out, you knowâ\\x80\\x94itâ\\x80\\x99s my\\r\\nbirthday! I have long looked forward to this happy occasion. Daria\\r\\nAlexeyevna, you see that nosegay-man, that Monsieur aux Camelias,\\r\\nsitting there laughing at us?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am not laughing, Nastasia Philipovna; I am only listening with all\\r\\nmy attention,â\\x80\\x9d said Totski, with dignity.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, why have I worried him, for five years, and never let him go\\r\\nfree? Is he worth it? He is only just what he ought to beâ\\x80\\x94nothing\\r\\nparticular. He thinks I am to blame, too. He gave me my education, kept\\r\\nme like a countess. Moneyâ\\x80\\x94my word! What a lot of money he spent over\\r\\nme! And he tried to find me an honest husband first, and then this\\r\\nGania, here. And what do you think? All these five years I did not live\\r\\nwith him, and yet I took his money, and considered I was quite\\r\\njustified.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou say, take the hundred thousand and kick that man out. It is true,\\r\\nit is an abominable business, as you say. I might have married long\\r\\nago, not Ganiaâ\\x80\\x94Oh, no!â\\x80\\x94but that would have been abominable too.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWould you believe it, I had some thoughts of marrying Totski, four\\r\\nyears ago! I meant mischief, I confessâ\\x80\\x94but I could have had him, I give\\r\\nyou my word; he asked me himself. But I thought, no! itâ\\x80\\x99s not\\r\\nworthwhile to take such advantage of him. No! I had better go on to the\\r\\nstreets, or accept Rogojin, or become a washerwoman or somethingâ\\x80\\x94for I\\r\\nhave nothing of my own, you know. I shall go away and leave everything\\r\\nbehind, to the last ragâ\\x80\\x94he shall have it all back. And who would take\\r\\nme without anything? Ask Gania, there, whether he would. Why, even\\r\\nFerdishenko wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have me!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, Ferdishenko would not; he is a candid fellow, Nastasia\\r\\nPhilipovna,â\\x80\\x9d said that worthy. â\\x80\\x9cBut the prince would. You sit here\\r\\nmaking complaints, but just look at the prince. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been observing him\\r\\nfor a long while.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNastasia Philipovna looked keenly round at the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs that true?â\\x80\\x9d she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuite true,â\\x80\\x9d whispered the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ll take me as I am, with nothing?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI will, Nastasia Philipovna.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHereâ\\x80\\x99s a pretty business!â\\x80\\x9d cried the general. â\\x80\\x9cHowever, it might have\\r\\nbeen expected of him.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince continued to regard Nastasia with a sorrowful, but intent\\r\\nand piercing, gaze.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHereâ\\x80\\x99s another alternative for me,â\\x80\\x9d said Nastasia, turning once more\\r\\nto the actress; â\\x80\\x9cand he does it out of pure kindness of heart. I know\\r\\nhim. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve found a benefactor. Perhaps, though, what they say about him\\r\\nmay be trueâ\\x80\\x94that heâ\\x80\\x99s anâ\\x80\\x94we know what. And what shall you live on, if\\r\\nyou are really so madly in love with Rogojinâ\\x80\\x99s mistress, that you are\\r\\nready to marry herâ\\x80\\x94eh?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI take you as a good, honest woman, Nastasia Philipovnaâ\\x80\\x94not as\\r\\nRogojinâ\\x80\\x99s mistress.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWho? I?â\\x80\\x94good and honest?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, you.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, you get those ideas out of novels, you know. Times are changed\\r\\nnow, dear prince; the world sees things as they really are. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s all\\r\\nnonsense. Besides, how can you marry? You need a nurse, not a wife.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince rose and began to speak in a trembling, timid tone, but with\\r\\nthe air of a man absolutely sure of the truth of his words.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know nothing, Nastasia Philipovna. I have seen nothing. You are\\r\\nright so far; but I consider that you would be honouring me, and not I\\r\\nyou. I am a nobody. You have suffered, you have passed through hell and\\r\\nemerged pure, and that is very much. Why do you shame yourself by\\r\\ndesiring to go with Rogojin? You are delirious. You have returned to\\r\\nMr. Totski his seventy-five thousand roubles, and declared that you\\r\\nwill leave this house and all that is in it, which is a line of conduct\\r\\nthat not one person here would imitate. Nastasia Philipovna, I love\\r\\nyou! I would die for you. I shall never let any man say one word\\r\\nagainst you, Nastasia Philipovna! and if we are poor, I can work for\\r\\nboth.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the prince spoke these last words a titter was heard from\\r\\nFerdishenko; Lebedeff laughed too. The general grunted with irritation;\\r\\nPtitsin and Totski barely restrained their smiles. The rest all sat\\r\\nlistening, open-mouthed with wonder.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut perhaps we shall not be poor; we may be very rich, Nastasia\\r\\nPhilipovna,â\\x80\\x9d continued the prince, in the same timid, quivering tones.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know for certain, and Iâ\\x80\\x99m sorry to say I havenâ\\x80\\x99t had an\\r\\nopportunity of finding out all day; but I received a letter from\\r\\nMoscow, while I was in Switzerland, from a Mr. Salaskin, and he\\r\\nacquaints me with the fact that I am entitled to a very large\\r\\ninheritance. This letterâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince pulled a letter out of his pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs he raving?â\\x80\\x9d said the general. â\\x80\\x9cAre we really in a mad-house?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was silence for a moment. Then Ptitsin spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think you said, prince, that your letter was from Salaskin? Salaskin\\r\\nis a very eminent man, indeed, in his own world; he is a wonderfully\\r\\nclever solicitor, and if he really tells you this, I think you may be\\r\\npretty sure that he is right. It so happens, luckily, that I know his\\r\\nhandwriting, for I have lately had business with him. If you would\\r\\nallow me to see it, I should perhaps be able to tell you.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince held out the letter silently, but with a shaking hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat, what?â\\x80\\x9d said the general, much agitated.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s all this? Is he really heir to anything?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAll present concentrated their attention upon Ptitsin, reading the\\r\\nprinceâ\\x80\\x99s letter. The general curiosity had received a new fillip.\\r\\nFerdishenko could not sit still. Rogojin fixed his eyes first on the\\r\\nprince, and then on Ptitsin, and then back again; he was extremely\\r\\nagitated. Lebedeff could not stand it. He crept up and read over\\r\\nPtitsinâ\\x80\\x99s shoulder, with the air of a naughty boy who expects a box on\\r\\nthe ear every moment for his indiscretion.\\r\\n\\r\\nXVI.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s good business,â\\x80\\x9d said Ptitsin, at last, folding the letter and\\r\\nhanding it back to the prince. â\\x80\\x9cYou will receive, without the slightest\\r\\ntrouble, by the last will and testament of your aunt, a very large sum\\r\\nof money indeed.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cImpossible!â\\x80\\x9d cried the general, starting up as if he had been shot.\\r\\n\\r\\nPtitsin explained, for the benefit of the company, that the princeâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\naunt had died five months since. He had never known her, but she was\\r\\nhis motherâ\\x80\\x99s own sister, the daughter of a Moscow merchant, one\\r\\nPaparchin, who had died a bankrupt. But the elder brother of this same\\r\\nPaparchin, had been an eminent and very rich merchant. A year since it\\r\\nhad so happened that his only two sons had both died within the same\\r\\nmonth. This sad event had so affected the old man that he, too, had\\r\\ndied very shortly after. He was a widower, and had no relations left,\\r\\nexcepting the princeâ\\x80\\x99s aunt, a poor woman living on charity, who was\\r\\nherself at the point of death from dropsy; but who had time, before she\\r\\ndied, to set Salaskin to work to find her nephew, and to make her will\\r\\nbequeathing her newly-acquired fortune to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt appeared that neither the prince, nor the doctor with whom he lived\\r\\nin Switzerland, had thought of waiting for further communications; but\\r\\nthe prince had started straight away with Salaskinâ\\x80\\x99s letter in his\\r\\npocket.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOne thing I may tell you, for certain,â\\x80\\x9d concluded Ptitsin, addressing\\r\\nthe prince, â\\x80\\x9cthat there is no question about the authenticity of this\\r\\nmatter. Anything that Salaskin writes you as regards your\\r\\nunquestionable right to this inheritance, you may look upon as so much\\r\\nmoney in your pocket. I congratulate you, prince; you may receive a\\r\\nmillion and a half of roubles, perhaps more; I donâ\\x80\\x99t know. All I _do_\\r\\nknow is that Paparchin was a very rich merchant indeed.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHurrah!â\\x80\\x9d cried Lebedeff, in a drunken voice. â\\x80\\x9cHurrah for the last of\\r\\nthe Muishkins!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy goodness me! and I gave him twenty-five roubles this morning as\\r\\nthough he were a beggar,â\\x80\\x9d blurted out the general, half senseless with\\r\\namazement. â\\x80\\x9cWell, I congratulate you, I congratulate you!â\\x80\\x9d And the\\r\\ngeneral rose from his seat and solemnly embraced the prince. All came\\r\\nforward with congratulations; even those of Rogojinâ\\x80\\x99s party who had\\r\\nretreated into the next room, now crept softly back to look on. For the\\r\\nmoment even Nastasia Philipovna was forgotten.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut gradually the consciousness crept back into the minds of each one\\r\\npresent that the prince had just made her an offer of marriage. The\\r\\nsituation had, therefore, become three times as fantastic as before.\\r\\n\\r\\nTotski sat and shrugged his shoulders, bewildered. He was the only\\r\\nguest left sitting at this time; the others had thronged round the\\r\\ntable in disorder, and were all talking at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was generally agreed, afterwards, in recalling that evening, that\\r\\nfrom this moment Nastasia Philipovna seemed entirely to lose her\\r\\nsenses. She continued to sit still in her place, looking around at her\\r\\nguests with a strange, bewildered expression, as though she were trying\\r\\nto collect her thoughts, and could not. Then she suddenly turned to the\\r\\nprince, and glared at him with frowning brows; but this only lasted one\\r\\nmoment. Perhaps it suddenly struck her that all this was a jest, but\\r\\nhis face seemed to reassure her. She reflected, and smiled again,\\r\\nvaguely.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo I am really a princess,â\\x80\\x9d she whispered to herself, ironically, and\\r\\nglancing accidentally at Daria Alexeyevnaâ\\x80\\x99s face, she burst out\\r\\nlaughing.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHa, ha, ha!â\\x80\\x9d she cried, â\\x80\\x9cthis is an unexpected climax, after all. I\\r\\ndidnâ\\x80\\x99t expect this. What are you all standing up for, gentlemen? Sit\\r\\ndown; congratulate me and the prince! Ferdishenko, just step out and\\r\\norder some more champagne, will you? Katia, Pasha,â\\x80\\x9d she added suddenly,\\r\\nseeing the servants at the door, â\\x80\\x9ccome here! Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to be married,\\r\\ndid you hear? To the prince. He has a million and a half of roubles; he\\r\\nis Prince Muishkin, and has asked me to marry him. Here, prince, come\\r\\nand sit by me; and here comes the wine. Now then, ladies and gentlemen,\\r\\nwhere are your congratulations?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHurrah!â\\x80\\x9d cried a number of voices. A rush was made for the wine by\\r\\nRogojinâ\\x80\\x99s followers, though, even among them, there seemed some sort of\\r\\nrealization that the situation had changed. Rogojin stood and looked\\r\\non, with an incredulous smile, screwing up one side of his mouth.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPrince, my dear fellow, do remember what you are about,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\r\\ngeneral, approaching Muishkin, and pulling him by the coat sleeve.\\r\\n\\r\\nNastasia Philipovna overheard the remark, and burst out laughing.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, no, general!â\\x80\\x9d she cried. â\\x80\\x9cYou had better look out! I am the\\r\\nprincess now, you know. The prince wonâ\\x80\\x99t let you insult me. Afanasy\\r\\nIvanovitch, why donâ\\x80\\x99t you congratulate me? I shall be able to sit at\\r\\ntable with your new wife, now. Aha! you see what I gain by marrying a\\r\\nprince! A million and a half, and a prince, and an idiot into the\\r\\nbargain, they say. What better could I wish for? Life is only just\\r\\nabout to commence for me in earnest. Rogojin, you are a little too\\r\\nlate. Away with your paper parcel! Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to marry the prince; Iâ\\x80\\x99m\\r\\nricher than you are now.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Rogojin understood how things were tending, at last. An\\r\\ninexpressibly painful expression came over his face. He wrung his\\r\\nhands; a groan made its way up from the depths of his soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSurrender her, for Godâ\\x80\\x99s sake!â\\x80\\x9d he said to the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll around burst out laughing.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat? Surrender her to _you?_â\\x80\\x9d cried Daria Alexeyevna. â\\x80\\x9cTo a fellow\\r\\nwho comes and bargains for a wife like a moujik! The prince wishes to\\r\\nmarry her, and youâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo do I, so do I! This moment, if I could! Iâ\\x80\\x99d give every farthing I\\r\\nhave to do it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou drunken moujik,â\\x80\\x9d said Daria Alexeyevna, once more. â\\x80\\x9cYou ought to\\r\\nbe kicked out of the place.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe laughter became louder than ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you hear, prince?â\\x80\\x9d said Nastasia Philipovna. â\\x80\\x9cDo you hear how this\\r\\nmoujik of a fellow goes on bargaining for your bride?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe is drunk,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, quietly, â\\x80\\x9cand he loves you very much.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWonâ\\x80\\x99t you be ashamed, afterwards, to reflect that your wife very\\r\\nnearly ran away with Rogojin?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, you were raving, you were in a fever; you are still half\\r\\ndelirious.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd wonâ\\x80\\x99t you be ashamed when they tell you, afterwards, that your\\r\\nwife lived at Totskiâ\\x80\\x99s expense so many years?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo; I shall not be ashamed of that. You did not so live by your own\\r\\nwill.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd youâ\\x80\\x99ll never reproach me with it?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNever.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTake care, donâ\\x80\\x99t commit yourself for a whole lifetime.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNastasia Philipovna.â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, quietly, and with deep emotion,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI said before that I shall esteem your consent to be my wife as a\\r\\ngreat honour to myself, and shall consider that it is you who will\\r\\nhonour me, not I you, by our marriage. You laughed at these words, and\\r\\nothers around us laughed as well; I heard them. Very likely I expressed\\r\\nmyself funnily, and I may have looked funny, but, for all that, I\\r\\nbelieve I understand where honour lies, and what I said was but the\\r\\nliteral truth. You were about to ruin yourself just now, irrevocably;\\r\\nyou would never have forgiven yourself for so doing afterwards; and\\r\\nyet, you are absolutely blameless. It is impossible that your life\\r\\nshould be altogether ruined at your age. What matter that Rogojin came\\r\\nbargaining here, and that Gavrila Ardalionovitch would have deceived\\r\\nyou if he could? Why do you continually remind us of these facts? I\\r\\nassure you once more that very few could find it in them to act as you\\r\\nhave acted this day. As for your wish to go with Rogojin, that was\\r\\nsimply the idea of a delirious and suffering brain. You are still quite\\r\\nfeverish; you ought to be in bed, not here. You know quite well that if\\r\\nyou had gone with Rogojin, you would have become a washer-woman next\\r\\nday, rather than stay with him. You are proud, Nastasia Philipovna, and\\r\\nperhaps you have really suffered so much that you imagine yourself to\\r\\nbe a desperately guilty woman. You require a great deal of petting and\\r\\nlooking after, Nastasia Philipovna, and I will do this. I saw your\\r\\nportrait this morning, and it seemed quite a familiar face to me; it\\r\\nseemed to me that the portrait-face was calling to me for help. Iâ\\x80\\x94I\\r\\nshall respect you all my life, Nastasia Philipovna,â\\x80\\x9d concluded the\\r\\nprince, as though suddenly recollecting himself, and blushing to think\\r\\nof the sort of company before whom he had said all this.\\r\\n\\r\\nPtitsin bowed his head and looked at the ground, overcome by a mixture\\r\\nof feelings. Totski muttered to himself: â\\x80\\x9cHe may be an idiot, but he\\r\\nknows that flattery is the best road to success here.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince observed Ganiaâ\\x80\\x99s eyes flashing at him, as though they would\\r\\ngladly annihilate him then and there.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s a kind-hearted man, if you like,â\\x80\\x9d said Daria Alexeyevna, whose\\r\\nwrath was quickly evaporating.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA refined man, butâ\\x80\\x94lost,â\\x80\\x9d murmured the general.\\r\\n\\r\\nTotski took his hat and rose to go. He and the general exchanged\\r\\nglances, making a private arrangement, thereby, to leave the house\\r\\ntogether.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank you, prince; no one has ever spoken to me like that before,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nbegan Nastasia Philipovna. â\\x80\\x9cMen have always bargained for me, before\\r\\nthis; and not a single respectable man has ever proposed to marry me.\\r\\nDo you hear, Afanasy Ivanovitch? What do _you_ think of what the prince\\r\\nhas just been saying? It was almost immodest, wasnâ\\x80\\x99t it? You, Rogojin,\\r\\nwait a moment, donâ\\x80\\x99t go yet! I see you donâ\\x80\\x99t intend to move however.\\r\\nPerhaps I may go with you yet. Where did you mean to take me to?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTo Ekaterinhof,â\\x80\\x9d replied Lebedeff. Rogojin simply stood staring, with\\r\\ntrembling lips, not daring to believe his ears. He was stunned, as\\r\\nthough from a blow on the head.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat are you thinking of, my dear Nastasia?â\\x80\\x9d said Daria Alexeyevna in\\r\\nalarm. â\\x80\\x9cWhat are you saying?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYou are not going mad, are you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNastasia Philipovna burst out laughing and jumped up from the sofa.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou thought I should accept this good childâ\\x80\\x99s invitation to ruin him,\\r\\ndid you?â\\x80\\x9d she cried. â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s Totskiâ\\x80\\x99s way, not mine. Heâ\\x80\\x99s fond of\\r\\nchildren. Come along, Rogojin, get your money ready! We wonâ\\x80\\x99t talk\\r\\nabout marrying just at this moment, but letâ\\x80\\x99s see the money at all\\r\\nevents. Come! I may not marry you, either. I donâ\\x80\\x99t know. I suppose you\\r\\nthought youâ\\x80\\x99d keep the money, if I did! Ha, ha, ha! nonsense! I have no\\r\\nsense of shame left. I tell you I have been Totskiâ\\x80\\x99s concubine. Prince,\\r\\nyou must marry Aglaya Ivanovna, not Nastasia Philipovna, or this fellow\\r\\nFerdishenko will always be pointing the finger of scorn at you. You\\r\\narenâ\\x80\\x99t afraid, I know; but I should always be afraid that I had ruined\\r\\nyou, and that you would reproach me for it. As for what you say about\\r\\nmy doing you honour by marrying youâ\\x80\\x94well, Totski can tell you all about\\r\\nthat. You had your eye on Aglaya, Gania, you know you had; and you\\r\\nmight have married her if you had not come bargaining. You are all like\\r\\nthis. You should choose, once for all, between disreputable women, and\\r\\nrespectable ones, or you are sure to get mixed. Look at the general,\\r\\nhow heâ\\x80\\x99s staring at me!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis is too horrible,â\\x80\\x9d said the general, starting to his feet. All\\r\\nwere standing up now. Nastasia was absolutely beside herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am very proud, in spite of what I am,â\\x80\\x9d she continued. â\\x80\\x9cYou called me\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98perfectionâ\\x80\\x99 just now, prince. A nice sort of perfection to throw up a\\r\\nprince and a million and a half of roubles in order to be able to boast\\r\\nof the fact afterwards! What sort of a wife should I make for you,\\r\\nafter all I have said? Afanasy Ivanovitch, do you observe I have really\\r\\nand truly thrown away a million of roubles? And you thought that I\\r\\nshould consider your wretched seventy-five thousand, with Gania thrown\\r\\nin for a husband, a paradise of bliss! Take your seventy-five thousand\\r\\nback, sir; you did not reach the hundred thousand. Rogojin cut a better\\r\\ndash than you did. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll console Gania myself; I have an idea about\\r\\nthat. But now I must be off! Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been in prison for ten years. Iâ\\x80\\x99m\\r\\nfree at last! Well, Rogojin, what are you waiting for? Letâ\\x80\\x99s get ready\\r\\nand go.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome along!â\\x80\\x9d shouted Rogojin, beside himself with joy. â\\x80\\x9cHey! all of\\r\\nyou fellows! Wine! Round with it! Fill the glasses!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGet away!â\\x80\\x9d he shouted frantically, observing that Daria Alexeyevna was\\r\\napproaching to protest against Nastasiaâ\\x80\\x99s conduct. â\\x80\\x9cGet away, sheâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nmine, everythingâ\\x80\\x99s mine! Sheâ\\x80\\x99s a queen, get away!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was panting with ecstasy. He walked round and round Nastasia\\r\\nPhilipovna and told everybody to â\\x80\\x9ckeep their distance.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the Rogojin company were now collected in the drawing-room; some\\r\\nwere drinking, some laughed and talked: all were in the highest and\\r\\nwildest spirits. Ferdishenko was doing his best to unite himself to\\r\\nthem; the general and Totski again made an attempt to go. Gania, too\\r\\nstood hat in hand ready to go; but seemed to be unable to tear his eyes\\r\\naway from the scene before him.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGet out, keep your distance!â\\x80\\x9d shouted Rogojin.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat are you shouting about there!â\\x80\\x9d cried Nastasia â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m not yours yet.\\r\\nI may kick you out for all you know I havenâ\\x80\\x99t taken your money yet;\\r\\nthere it all is on the table. Here, give me over that packet! Is there\\r\\na hundred thousand roubles in that one packet? Pfu! what abominable\\r\\nstuff it looks! Oh! nonsense, Daria Alexeyevna; you surely did not\\r\\nexpect me to ruin _him?_â\\x80\\x9d (indicating the prince). â\\x80\\x9cFancy him nursing\\r\\nme! Why, he needs a nurse himself! The general, there, will be his\\r\\nnurse now, youâ\\x80\\x99ll see. Here, prince, look here! Your bride is accepting\\r\\nmoney. What a disreputable woman she must be! And you wished to marry\\r\\nher! What are you crying about? Is it a bitter dose? Never mind, you\\r\\nshall laugh yet. Trust to time.â\\x80\\x9d (In spite of these words there were\\r\\ntwo large tears rolling down Nastasiaâ\\x80\\x99s own cheeks.) â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s far better\\r\\nto think twice of it now than afterwards. Oh! you mustnâ\\x80\\x99t cry like\\r\\nthat! Thereâ\\x80\\x99s Katia crying, too. What is it, Katia, dear? I shall leave\\r\\nyou and Pasha a lot of things, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve laid them out for you already; but\\r\\ngood-bye, now. I made an honest girl like you serve a low woman like\\r\\nmyself. Itâ\\x80\\x99s better so, prince, it is indeed. Youâ\\x80\\x99d begin to despise me\\r\\nafterwardsâ\\x80\\x94we should never be happy. Oh! you neednâ\\x80\\x99t swear, prince, I\\r\\nshanâ\\x80\\x99t believe you, you know. How foolish it would be, too! No, no;\\r\\nweâ\\x80\\x99d better say good-bye and part friends. I am a bit of a dreamer\\r\\nmyself, and I used to dream of you once. Very often during those five\\r\\nyears down at his estate I used to dream and think, and I always\\r\\nimagined just such a good, honest, foolish fellow as you, one who\\r\\nshould come and say to me: â\\x80\\x98You are an innocent woman, Nastasia\\r\\nPhilipovna, and I adore you.â\\x80\\x99 I dreamt of you often. I used to think so\\r\\nmuch down there that I nearly went mad; and then this fellow here would\\r\\ncome down. He would stay a couple of months out of the twelve, and\\r\\ndisgrace and insult and deprave me, and then go; so that I longed to\\r\\ndrown myself in the pond a thousand times over; but I did not dare do\\r\\nit. I hadnâ\\x80\\x99t the heart, and nowâ\\x80\\x94well, are you ready, Rogojin?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cReadyâ\\x80\\x94keep your distance, all of you!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re all ready,â\\x80\\x9d said several of his friends. â\\x80\\x9cThe troikas [Sledges\\r\\ndrawn by three horses abreast.] are at the door, bells and all.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNastasia Philipovna seized the packet of bank-notes.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGania, I have an idea. I wish to recompense youâ\\x80\\x94why should you lose\\r\\nall? Rogojin, would he crawl for three roubles as far as the\\r\\nVassiliostrof?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t he just!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, look here, Gania. I wish to look into your heart once more, for\\r\\nthe last time. Youâ\\x80\\x99ve worried me for the last three monthsâ\\x80\\x94now itâ\\x80\\x99s my\\r\\nturn. Do you see this packet? It contains a hundred thousand roubles.\\r\\nNow, Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to throw it into the fire, hereâ\\x80\\x94before all these\\r\\nwitnesses. As soon as the fire catches hold of it, you put your hands\\r\\ninto the fire and pick it outâ\\x80\\x94without gloves, you know. You must have\\r\\nbare hands, and you must turn your sleeves up. Pull it out, I say, and\\r\\nitâ\\x80\\x99s all yours. You may burn your fingers a little, of course; but then\\r\\nitâ\\x80\\x99s a hundred thousand roubles, rememberâ\\x80\\x94it wonâ\\x80\\x99t take you long to lay\\r\\nhold of it and snatch it out. I shall so much admire you if you put\\r\\nyour hands into the fire for my money. All here present may be\\r\\nwitnesses that the whole packet of money is yours if you get it out. If\\r\\nyou donâ\\x80\\x99t get it out, it shall burn. I will let no one else come;\\r\\nawayâ\\x80\\x94get away, all of youâ\\x80\\x94itâ\\x80\\x99s my money! Rogojin has bought me with it.\\r\\nIs it my money, Rogojin?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, my queen; itâ\\x80\\x99s your own money, my joy.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGet away then, all of you. I shall do as I like with my ownâ\\x80\\x94donâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nmeddle! Ferdishenko, make up the fire, quick!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNastasia Philipovna, I canâ\\x80\\x99t; my hands wonâ\\x80\\x99t obey me,â\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nFerdishenko, astounded and helpless with bewilderment.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNonsense,â\\x80\\x9d cried Nastasia Philipovna, seizing the poker and raking a\\r\\ncouple of logs together. No sooner did a tongue of flame burst out than\\r\\nshe threw the packet of notes upon it.\\r\\n\\r\\nEveryone gasped; some even crossed themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSheâ\\x80\\x99s madâ\\x80\\x94sheâ\\x80\\x99s mad!â\\x80\\x9d was the cry.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOughtnâ\\x80\\x99t-oughtnâ\\x80\\x99t we to secure her?â\\x80\\x9d asked the general of Ptitsin, in\\r\\na whisper; â\\x80\\x9cor shall we send for the authorities? Why, sheâ\\x80\\x99s mad, isnâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nsheâ\\x80\\x94isnâ\\x80\\x99t she, eh?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cN-no, I hardly think she is actually mad,â\\x80\\x9d whispered Ptitsin, who was\\r\\nas white as his handkerchief, and trembling like a leaf. He could not\\r\\ntake his eyes off the smouldering packet.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSheâ\\x80\\x99s mad surely, isnâ\\x80\\x99t she?â\\x80\\x9d the general appealed to Totski.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI told you she wasnâ\\x80\\x99t an ordinary woman,â\\x80\\x9d replied the latter, who was\\r\\nas pale as anyone.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, but, positively, you knowâ\\x80\\x94a hundred thousand roubles!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGoodness gracious! good heavens!â\\x80\\x9d came from all quarters of the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll now crowded round the fire and thronged to see what was going on;\\r\\neveryone lamented and gave vent to exclamations of horror and woe. Some\\r\\njumped up on chairs in order to get a better view. Daria Alexeyevna ran\\r\\ninto the next room and whispered excitedly to Katia and Pasha. The\\r\\nbeautiful German disappeared altogether.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy lady! my sovereign!â\\x80\\x9d lamented Lebedeff, falling on his knees before\\r\\nNastasia Philipovna, and stretching out his hands towards the fire;\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s a hundred thousand roubles, it is indeed, I packed it up myself,\\r\\nI saw the money! My queen, let me get into the fire after itâ\\x80\\x94say the\\r\\nwordâ\\x80\\x94Iâ\\x80\\x99ll put my whole grey head into the fire for it! I have a poor\\r\\nlame wife and thirteen children. My father died of starvation last\\r\\nweek. Nastasia Philipovna, Nastasia Philipovna!â\\x80\\x9d The wretched little\\r\\nman wept, and groaned, and crawled towards the fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAway, out of the way!â\\x80\\x9d cried Nastasia. â\\x80\\x9cMake room, all of you! Gania,\\r\\nwhat are you standing there for? Donâ\\x80\\x99t stand on ceremony. Put in your\\r\\nhand! Thereâ\\x80\\x99s your whole happiness smouldering away, look! Quick!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Gania had borne too much that day, and especially this evening, and\\r\\nhe was not prepared for this last, quite unexpected trial.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crowd parted on each side of him and he was left face to face with\\r\\nNastasia Philipovna, three paces from her. She stood by the fire and\\r\\nwaited, with her intent gaze fixed upon him.\\r\\n\\r\\nGania stood before her, in his evening clothes, holding his white\\r\\ngloves and hat in his hand, speechless and motionless, with arms folded\\r\\nand eyes fixed on the fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nA silly, meaningless smile played on his white, death-like lips. He\\r\\ncould not take his eyes off the smouldering packet; but it appeared\\r\\nthat something new had come to birth in his soulâ\\x80\\x94as though he were\\r\\nvowing to himself that he would bear this trial. He did not move from\\r\\nhis place. In a few seconds it became evident to all that he did not\\r\\nintend to rescue the money.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHey! look at it, itâ\\x80\\x99ll burn in another minute or two!â\\x80\\x9d cried Nastasia\\r\\nPhilipovna. â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ll hang yourself afterwards, you know, if it does! Iâ\\x80\\x99m\\r\\nnot joking.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fire, choked between a couple of smouldering pieces of wood, had\\r\\ndied down for the first few moments after the packet was thrown upon\\r\\nit. But a little tongue of fire now began to lick the paper from below,\\r\\nand soon, gathering courage, mounted the sides of the parcel, and crept\\r\\naround it. In another moment, the whole of it burst into flames, and\\r\\nthe exclamations of woe and horror were redoubled.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNastasia Philipovna!â\\x80\\x9d lamented Lebedeff again, straining towards the\\r\\nfireplace; but Rogojin dragged him away, and pushed him to the rear\\r\\nonce more.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole of Rogojinâ\\x80\\x99s being was concentrated in one rapturous gaze of\\r\\necstasy. He could not take his eyes off Nastasia. He stood drinking her\\r\\nin, as it were. He was in the seventh heaven of delight.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, what a queen she is!â\\x80\\x9d he ejaculated, every other minute, throwing\\r\\nout the remark for anyone who liked to catch it. â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s the sort of\\r\\nwoman for me! Which of you would think of doing a thing like that, you\\r\\nblackguards, eh?â\\x80\\x9d he yelled. He was hopelessly and wildly beside\\r\\nhimself with ecstasy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince watched the whole scene, silent and dejected.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll pull it out with my teeth for one thousand,â\\x80\\x9d said Ferdishenko.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo would I,â\\x80\\x9d said another, from behind, â\\x80\\x9cwith pleasure. Devil take the\\r\\nthing!â\\x80\\x9d he added, in a tempest of despair, â\\x80\\x9cit will all be burnt up in\\r\\na minuteâ\\x80\\x94Itâ\\x80\\x99s burning, itâ\\x80\\x99s burning!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s burning, itâ\\x80\\x99s burning!â\\x80\\x9d cried all, thronging nearer and nearer to\\r\\nthe fire in their excitement.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGania, donâ\\x80\\x99t be a fool! I tell you for the last time.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGet on, quick!â\\x80\\x9d shrieked Ferdishenko, rushing wildly up to Gania, and\\r\\ntrying to drag him to the fire by the sleeve of his coat. â\\x80\\x9cGet it, you\\r\\ndummy, itâ\\x80\\x99s burning away fast! Ohâ\\x80\\x94_damn_ the thing!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nGania hurled Ferdishenko from him; then he turned sharp round and made\\r\\nfor the door. But he had not gone a couple of steps when he tottered\\r\\nand fell to the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s fainted!â\\x80\\x9d the cry went round.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd the moneyâ\\x80\\x99s burning still,â\\x80\\x9d Lebedeff lamented.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBurning for nothing,â\\x80\\x9d shouted others.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cKatia-Pasha! Bring him some water!â\\x80\\x9d cried Nastasia Philipovna. Then\\r\\nshe took the tongs and fished out the packet.\\r\\n\\r\\nNearly the whole of the outer covering was burned away, but it was soon\\r\\nevident that the contents were hardly touched. The packet had been\\r\\nwrapped in a threefold covering of newspaper, and the notes were safe.\\r\\nAll breathed more freely.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSome dirty little thousand or so may be touched,â\\x80\\x9d said Lebedeff,\\r\\nimmensely relieved, â\\x80\\x9cbut thereâ\\x80\\x99s very little harm done, after all.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s all hisâ\\x80\\x94the whole packet is for him, do you hearâ\\x80\\x94all of you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\ncried Nastasia Philipovna, placing the packet by the side of Gania. â\\x80\\x9cHe\\r\\nrestrained himself, and didnâ\\x80\\x99t go after it; so his self-respect is\\r\\ngreater than his thirst for money. All rightâ\\x80\\x94heâ\\x80\\x99ll come to directlyâ\\x80\\x94he\\r\\nmust have the packet or heâ\\x80\\x99ll cut his throat afterwards. There! Heâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ncoming to himself. General, Totski, all of you, did you hear me? The\\r\\nmoney is all Ganiaâ\\x80\\x99s. I give it to him, fully conscious of my action,\\r\\nas recompense forâ\\x80\\x94well, for anything he thinks best. Tell him so. Let\\r\\nit lie here beside him. Off we go, Rogojin! Goodbye, prince. I have\\r\\nseen a man for the first time in my life. Goodbye, Afanasy\\r\\nIvanovitchâ\\x80\\x94and thanks!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Rogojin gang followed their leader and Nastasia Philipovna to the\\r\\nentrance-hall, laughing and shouting and whistling.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the hall the servants were waiting, and handed her her fur cloak.\\r\\nMartha, the cook, ran in from the kitchen. Nastasia kissed them all\\r\\nround.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAre you really throwing us all over, little mother? Where, where are\\r\\nyou going to? And on your birthday, too!â\\x80\\x9d cried the four girls, crying\\r\\nover her and kissing her hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am going out into the world, Katia; perhaps I shall be a laundress.\\r\\nI donâ\\x80\\x99t know. No more of Afanasy Ivanovitch, anyhow. Give him my\\r\\nrespects. Donâ\\x80\\x99t think badly of me, girls.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince hurried down to the front gate where the party were settling\\r\\ninto the troikas, all the bells tinkling a merry accompaniment the\\r\\nwhile. The general caught him up on the stairs:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPrince, prince!â\\x80\\x9d he cried, seizing hold of his arm, â\\x80\\x9crecollect\\r\\nyourself! Drop her, prince! You see what sort of a woman she is. I am\\r\\nspeaking to you like a father.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince glanced at him, but said nothing. He shook himself free, and\\r\\nrushed on downstairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general was just in time to see the prince take the first sledge he\\r\\ncould get, and, giving the order to Ekaterinhof, start off in pursuit\\r\\nof the troikas. Then the generalâ\\x80\\x99s fine grey horse dragged that worthy\\r\\nhome, with some new thoughts, and some new hopes and calculations\\r\\ndeveloping in his brain, and with the pearls in his pocket, for he had\\r\\nnot forgotten to bring them along with him, being a man of business.\\r\\nAmid his new thoughts and ideas there came, once or twice, the image of\\r\\nNastasia Philipovna. The general sighed.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m sorry, really sorry,â\\x80\\x9d he muttered. â\\x80\\x9cSheâ\\x80\\x99s a ruined woman. Mad!\\r\\nmad! However, the prince is not for Nastasia Philipovna now,â\\x80\\x94perhaps\\r\\nitâ\\x80\\x99s as well.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo more of Nastasiaâ\\x80\\x99s guests, who walked a short distance together,\\r\\nindulged in high moral sentiments of a similar nature.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you know, Totski, this is all very like what they say goes on among\\r\\nthe Japanese?â\\x80\\x9d said Ptitsin. â\\x80\\x9cThe offended party there, they say,\\r\\nmarches off to his insulter and says to him, â\\x80\\x98You insulted me, so I\\r\\nhave come to rip myself open before your eyes;â\\x80\\x99 and with these words he\\r\\ndoes actually rip his stomach open before his enemy, and considers,\\r\\ndoubtless, that he is having all possible and necessary satisfaction\\r\\nand revenge. There are strange characters in the world, sir!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHâ\\x80\\x99m! and you think there was something of this sort here, do you? Dear\\r\\nmeâ\\x80\\x94a very remarkable comparison, you know! But you must have observed,\\r\\nmy dear Ptitsin, that I did all I possibly could. I could do no more\\r\\nthan I did. And you must admit that there are some rare qualities in\\r\\nthis woman. I felt I could not speak in that Bedlam, or I should have\\r\\nbeen tempted to cry out, when she reproached me, that she herself was\\r\\nmy best justification. Such a woman could make anyone forget all\\r\\nreasonâ\\x80\\x94everything! Even that moujik, Rogojin, you saw, brought her a\\r\\nhundred thousand roubles! Of course, all that happened tonight was\\r\\nephemeral, fantastic, unseemlyâ\\x80\\x94yet it lacked neither colour nor\\r\\noriginality. My God! What might not have been made of such a character\\r\\ncombined with such beauty! Yet in spite of all effortsâ\\x80\\x94in spite of all\\r\\neducation, evenâ\\x80\\x94all those gifts are wasted! She is an uncut diamond....\\r\\nI have often said so.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Afanasy Ivanovitch heaved a deep sigh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPART II\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo days after the strange conclusion to Nastasia Philipovnaâ\\x80\\x99s birthday\\r\\nparty, with the record of which we concluded the first part of this\\r\\nstory, Prince Muishkin hurriedly left St. Petersburg for Moscow, in\\r\\norder to see after some business connected with the receipt of his\\r\\nunexpected fortune.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was said that there were other reasons for his hurried departure;\\r\\nbut as to this, and as to his movements in Moscow, and as to his\\r\\nprolonged absence from St. Petersburg, we are able to give very little\\r\\ninformation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince was away for six months, and even those who were most\\r\\ninterested in his destiny were able to pick up very little news about\\r\\nhim all that while. True, certain rumours did reach his friends, but\\r\\nthese were both strange and rare, and each one contradicted the last.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course the Epanchin family was much interested in his movements,\\r\\nthough he had not had time to bid them farewell before his departure.\\r\\nThe general, however, had had an opportunity of seeing him once or\\r\\ntwice since the eventful evening, and had spoken very seriously with\\r\\nhim; but though he had seen the prince, as I say, he told his family\\r\\nnothing about the circumstance. In fact, for a month or so after his\\r\\ndeparture it was considered not the thing to mention the princeâ\\x80\\x99s name\\r\\nin the Epanchin household. Only Mrs. Epanchin, at the commencement of\\r\\nthis period, had announced that she had been â\\x80\\x9ccruelly mistaken in the\\r\\nprince!â\\x80\\x9d and a day or two after, she had added, evidently alluding to\\r\\nhim, but not mentioning his name, that it was an unalterable\\r\\ncharacteristic of hers to be mistaken in people. Then once more, ten\\r\\ndays later, after some passage of arms with one of her daughters, she\\r\\nhad remarked sententiously. â\\x80\\x9cWe have had enough of mistakes. I shall be\\r\\nmore careful in future!â\\x80\\x9d However, it was impossible to avoid remarking\\r\\nthat there was some sense of oppression in the householdâ\\x80\\x94something\\r\\nunspoken, but felt; something strained. All the members of the family\\r\\nwore frowning looks. The general was unusually busy; his family hardly\\r\\never saw him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to the girls, nothing was said openly, at all events; and probably\\r\\nvery little in private. They were proud damsels, and were not always\\r\\nperfectly confidential even among themselves. But they understood each\\r\\nother thoroughly at the first word on all occasions; very often at the\\r\\nfirst glance, so that there was no need of much talking as a rule.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne fact, at least, would have been perfectly plain to an outsider, had\\r\\nany such person been on the spot; and that was, that the prince had\\r\\nmade a very considerable impression upon the family, in spite of the\\r\\nfact that he had but once been inside the house, and then only for a\\r\\nshort time. Of course, if analyzed, this impression might have proved\\r\\nto be nothing more than a feeling of curiosity; but be it what it\\r\\nmight, there it undoubtedly was.\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle by little, the rumours spread about town became lost in a maze\\r\\nof uncertainty. It was said that some foolish young prince, name\\r\\nunknown, had suddenly come into possession of a gigantic fortune, and\\r\\nhad married a French ballet dancer. This was contradicted, and the\\r\\nrumour circulated that it was a young merchant who had come into the\\r\\nenormous fortune and married the great ballet dancer, and that at the\\r\\nwedding the drunken young fool had burned seventy thousand roubles at a\\r\\ncandle out of pure bravado.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, all these rumours soon died down, to which circumstance\\r\\ncertain facts largely contributed. For instance, the whole of the\\r\\nRogojin troop had departed, with him at their head, for Moscow. This\\r\\nwas exactly a week after a dreadful orgy at the Ekaterinhof gardens,\\r\\nwhere Nastasia Philipovna had been present. It became known that after\\r\\nthis orgy Nastasia Philipovna had entirely disappeared, and that she\\r\\nhad since been traced to Moscow; so that the exodus of the Rogojin band\\r\\nwas found consistent with this report.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were rumours current as to Gania, too; but circumstances soon\\r\\ncontradicted these. He had fallen seriously ill, and his illness\\r\\nprecluded his appearance in society, and even at business, for over a\\r\\nmonth. As soon as he had recovered, however, he threw up his situation\\r\\nin the public company under General Epanchinâ\\x80\\x99s direction, for some\\r\\nunknown reason, and the post was given to another. He never went near\\r\\nthe Epanchinsâ\\x80\\x99 house at all, and was exceedingly irritable and\\r\\ndepressed.\\r\\n\\r\\nVarvara Ardalionovna married Ptitsin this winter, and it was said that\\r\\nthe fact of Ganiaâ\\x80\\x99s retirement from business was the ultimate cause of\\r\\nthe marriage, since Gania was now not only unable to support his\\r\\nfamily, but even required help himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may mention that Gania was no longer mentioned in the Epanchin\\r\\nhousehold any more than the prince was; but that a certain circumstance\\r\\nin connection with the fatal evening at Nastasiaâ\\x80\\x99s house became known\\r\\nto the general, and, in fact, to all the family the very next day. This\\r\\nfact was that Gania had come home that night, but had refused to go to\\r\\nbed. He had awaited the princeâ\\x80\\x99s return from Ekaterinhof with feverish\\r\\nimpatience.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the latterâ\\x80\\x99s arrival, at six in the morning, Gania had gone to him\\r\\nin his room, bringing with him the singed packet of money, which he had\\r\\ninsisted that the prince should return to Nastasia Philipovna without\\r\\ndelay. It was said that when Gania entered the princeâ\\x80\\x99s room, he came\\r\\nwith anything but friendly feelings, and in a condition of despair and\\r\\nmisery; but that after a short conversation, he had stayed on for a\\r\\ncouple of hours with him, sobbing continuously and bitterly the whole\\r\\ntime. They had parted upon terms of cordial friendship.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Epanchins heard about this, as well as about the episode at\\r\\nNastasia Philipovnaâ\\x80\\x99s. It was strange, perhaps, that the facts should\\r\\nbecome so quickly, and fairly accurately, known. As far as Gania was\\r\\nconcerned, it might have been supposed that the news had come through\\r\\nVarvara Ardalionovna, who had suddenly become a frequent visitor of the\\r\\nEpanchin girls, greatly to their motherâ\\x80\\x99s surprise. But though Varvara\\r\\nhad seen fit, for some reason, to make friends with them, it was not\\r\\nlikely that she would have talked to them about her brother. She had\\r\\nplenty of pride, in spite of the fact that in thus acting she was\\r\\nseeking intimacy with people who had practically shown her brother the\\r\\ndoor. She and the Epanchin girls had been acquainted in childhood,\\r\\nalthough of late they had met but rarely. Even now Varvara hardly ever\\r\\nappeared in the drawing-room, but would slip in by a back way.\\r\\nLizabetha Prokofievna, who disliked Varvara, although she had a great\\r\\nrespect for her mother, was much annoyed by this sudden intimacy, and\\r\\nput it down to the general â\\x80\\x9ccontrarinessâ\\x80\\x9d of her daughters, who were\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9calways on the lookout for some new way of opposing her.â\\x80\\x9d Nevertheless,\\r\\nVarvara continued her visits.\\r\\n\\r\\nA month after Muishkinâ\\x80\\x99s departure, Mrs. Epanchin received a letter\\r\\nfrom her old friend Princess Bielokonski (who had lately left for\\r\\nMoscow), which letter put her into the greatest good humour. She did\\r\\nnot divulge its contents either to her daughters or the general, but\\r\\nher conduct towards the former became affectionate in the extreme. She\\r\\neven made some sort of confession to them, but they were unable to\\r\\nunderstand what it was about. She actually relaxed towards the general\\r\\na littleâ\\x80\\x94he had been long disgracedâ\\x80\\x94and though she managed to quarrel\\r\\nwith them all the next day, yet she soon came round, and from her\\r\\ngeneral behaviour it was to be concluded that she had had good news of\\r\\nsome sort, which she would like, but could not make up her mind, to\\r\\ndisclose.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, a week later she received another letter from the same source,\\r\\nand at last resolved to speak.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe solemnly announced that she had heard from old Princess\\r\\nBielokonski, who had given her most comforting news about â\\x80\\x9cthat queer\\r\\nyoung prince.â\\x80\\x9d Her friend had hunted him up, and found that all was\\r\\ngoing well with him. He had since called in person upon her, making an\\r\\nextremely favourable impression, for the princess had received him each\\r\\nday since, and had introduced him into several good houses.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girls could see that their mother concealed a great deal from them,\\r\\nand left out large pieces of the letter in reading it to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the ice was broken, and it suddenly became possible to mention\\r\\nthe princeâ\\x80\\x99s name again. And again it became evident how very strong\\r\\nwas the impression the young man had made in the household by his one\\r\\nvisit there. Mrs. Epanchin was surprised at the effect which the news\\r\\nfrom Moscow had upon the girls, and they were no less surprised that\\r\\nafter solemnly remarking that her most striking characteristic was\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbeing mistaken in peopleâ\\x80\\x9d she should have troubled to obtain for the\\r\\nprince the favour and protection of so powerful an old lady as the\\r\\nPrincess Bielokonski. As soon as the ice was thus broken, the general\\r\\nlost no time in showing that he, too, took the greatest interest in the\\r\\nsubject. He admitted that he was interested, but said that it was\\r\\nmerely in the business side of the question. It appeared that, in the\\r\\ninterests of the prince, he had made arrangements in Moscow for a\\r\\ncareful watch to be kept upon the princeâ\\x80\\x99s business affairs, and\\r\\nespecially upon Salaskin. All that had been said as to the prince being\\r\\nan undoubted heir to a fortune turned out to be perfectly true; but the\\r\\nfortune proved to be much smaller than was at first reported. The\\r\\nestate was considerably encumbered with debts; creditors turned up on\\r\\nall sides, and the prince, in spite of all advice and entreaty,\\r\\ninsisted upon managing all matters of claim himselfâ\\x80\\x94which, of course,\\r\\nmeant satisfying everybody all round, although half the claims were\\r\\nabsolutely fraudulent.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Epanchin confirmed all this. She said the princess had written to\\r\\nmuch the same effect, and added that there was no curing a fool. But it\\r\\nwas plain, from her expression of face, how strongly she approved of\\r\\nthis particular young foolâ\\x80\\x99s doings. In conclusion, the general\\r\\nobserved that his wife took as great an interest in the prince as\\r\\nthough he were her own son; and that she had commenced to be especially\\r\\naffectionate towards Aglaya was a self-evident fact.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this caused the general to look grave and important. But, alas!\\r\\nthis agreeable state of affairs very soon changed once more.\\r\\n\\r\\nA couple of weeks went by, and suddenly the general and his wife were\\r\\nonce more gloomy and silent, and the ice was as firm as ever. The fact\\r\\nwas, the general, who had heard first, how Nastasia Philipovna had fled\\r\\nto Moscow and had been discovered there by Rogojin; that she had then\\r\\ndisappeared once more, and been found again by Rogojin, and how after\\r\\nthat she had almost promised to marry him, now received news that she\\r\\nhad once more disappeared, almost on the very day fixed for her\\r\\nwedding, flying somewhere into the interior of Russia this time, and\\r\\nthat Prince Muishkin had left all his affairs in the hands of Salaskin\\r\\nand disappeared alsoâ\\x80\\x94but whether he was with Nastasia, or had only set\\r\\noff in search of her, was unknown.\\r\\n\\r\\nLizabetha Prokofievna received confirmatory news from the princessâ\\x80\\x94and\\r\\nalas, two months after the princeâ\\x80\\x99s first departure from St.\\r\\nPetersburg, darkness and mystery once more enveloped his whereabouts\\r\\nand actions, and in the Epanchin family the ice of silence once more\\r\\nformed over the subject. Varia, however, informed the girls of what had\\r\\nhappened, she having received the news from Ptitsin, who generally knew\\r\\nmore than most people.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo make an end, we may say that there were many changes in the Epanchin\\r\\nhousehold in the spring, so that it was not difficult to forget the\\r\\nprince, who sent no news of himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Epanchin family had at last made up their minds to spend the summer\\r\\nabroad, all except the general, who could not waste time in â\\x80\\x9ctravelling\\r\\nfor enjoyment,â\\x80\\x9d of course. This arrangement was brought about by the\\r\\npersistence of the girls, who insisted that they were never allowed to\\r\\ngo abroad because their parents were too anxious to marry them off.\\r\\nPerhaps their parents had at last come to the conclusion that husbands\\r\\nmight be found abroad, and that a summerâ\\x80\\x99s travel might bear fruit. The\\r\\nmarriage between Alexandra and Totski had been broken off. Since the\\r\\nprinceâ\\x80\\x99s departure from St. Petersburg no more had been said about it;\\r\\nthe subject had been dropped without ceremony, much to the joy of Mrs.\\r\\nGeneral, who, announced that she was â\\x80\\x9cready to cross herself with both\\r\\nhandsâ\\x80\\x9d in gratitude for the escape. The general, however, regretted\\r\\nTotski for a long while. â\\x80\\x9cSuch a fortune!â\\x80\\x9d he sighed, â\\x80\\x9cand such a good,\\r\\neasy-going fellow!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a time it became known that Totski had married a French marquise,\\r\\nand was to be carried off by her to Paris, and then to Brittany.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, well,â\\x80\\x9d thought the general, â\\x80\\x9cheâ\\x80\\x99s lost to us for good, now.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the Epanchins prepared to depart for the summer.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut now another circumstance occurred, which changed all the plans once\\r\\nmore, and again the intended journey was put off, much to the delight\\r\\nof the general and his spouse.\\r\\n\\r\\nA certain Prince Sâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94 arrived in St. Petersburg from Moscow, an eminent\\r\\nand honourable young man. He was one of those active persons who always\\r\\nfind some good work with which to employ themselves. Without forcing\\r\\nhimself upon the public notice, modest and unobtrusive, this young\\r\\nprince was concerned with much that happened in the world in general.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had served, at first, in one of the civil departments, had then\\r\\nattended to matters connected with the local government of provincial\\r\\ntowns, and had of late been a corresponding member of several important\\r\\nscientific societies. He was a man of excellent family and solid means,\\r\\nabout thirty-five years of age.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrince Sâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94 made the acquaintance of the generalâ\\x80\\x99s family, and Adelaida,\\r\\nthe second girl, made a great impression upon him. Towards the spring\\r\\nhe proposed to her, and she accepted him. The general and his wife were\\r\\ndelighted. The journey abroad was put off, and the wedding was fixed\\r\\nfor a day not very distant.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe trip abroad might have been enjoyed later on by Mrs. Epanchin and\\r\\nher two remaining daughters, but for another circumstance.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt so happened that Prince Sâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94 introduced a distant relation of his own\\r\\ninto the Epanchin familyâ\\x80\\x94one Evgenie Pavlovitch, a young officer of\\r\\nabout twenty-eight years of age, whose conquests among the ladies in\\r\\nMoscow had been proverbial. This young gentleman no sooner set eyes on\\r\\nAglaya than he became a frequent visitor at the house. He was witty,\\r\\nwell-educated, and extremely wealthy, as the general very soon\\r\\ndiscovered. His past reputation was the only thing against him.\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing was said; there were not even any hints dropped; but still, it\\r\\nseemed better to the parents to say nothing more about going abroad\\r\\nthis season, at all events. Aglaya herself perhaps was of a different\\r\\nopinion.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this happened just before the second appearance of our hero upon\\r\\nthe scene.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time, to judge from appearances, poor Prince Muishkin had been\\r\\nquite forgotten in St. Petersburg. If he had appeared suddenly among\\r\\nhis acquaintances, he would have been received as one from the skies;\\r\\nbut we must just glance at one more fact before we conclude this\\r\\npreface.\\r\\n\\r\\nColia Ivolgin, for some time after the princeâ\\x80\\x99s departure, continued\\r\\nhis old life. That is, he went to school, looked after his father,\\r\\nhelped Varia in the house, and ran her errands, and went frequently to\\r\\nsee his friend, Hippolyte.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lodgers had disappeared very quicklyâ\\x80\\x94Ferdishenko soon after the\\r\\nevents at Nastasia Philipovnaâ\\x80\\x99s, while the prince went to Moscow, as we\\r\\nknow. Gania and his mother went to live with Varia and Ptitsin\\r\\nimmediately after the latterâ\\x80\\x99s wedding, while the general was housed in\\r\\na debtorâ\\x80\\x99s prison by reason of certain IOUâ\\x80\\x99s given to the captainâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nwidow under the impression that they would never be formally used\\r\\nagainst him. This unkind action much surprised poor Ardalion\\r\\nAlexandrovitch, the victim, as he called himself, of an â\\x80\\x9cunbounded\\r\\ntrust in the nobility of the human heart.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he signed those notes of hand he never dreamt that they would be a\\r\\nsource of future trouble. The event showed that he was mistaken. â\\x80\\x9cTrust\\r\\nin anyone after this! Have the least confidence in man or woman!â\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\ncried in bitter tones, as he sat with his new friends in prison, and\\r\\nrecounted to them his favourite stories of the siege of Kars, and the\\r\\nresuscitated soldier. On the whole, he accommodated himself very well\\r\\nto his new position. Ptitsin and Varia declared that he was in the\\r\\nright place, and Gania was of the same opinion. The only person who\\r\\ndeplored his fate was poor Nina Alexandrovna, who wept bitter tears\\r\\nover him, to the great surprise of her household, and, though always in\\r\\nfeeble health, made a point of going to see him as often as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the generalâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9cmishap,â\\x80\\x9d as Colia called it, and the marriage of\\r\\nhis sister, the boy had quietly possessed himself of far more freedom.\\r\\nHis relations saw little of him, for he rarely slept at home. He made\\r\\nmany new friends; and was moreover, a frequent visitor at the debtorâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nprison, to which he invariably accompanied his mother. Varia, who used\\r\\nto be always correcting him, never spoke to him now on the subject of\\r\\nhis frequent absences, and the whole household was surprised to see\\r\\nGania, in spite of his depression, on quite friendly terms with his\\r\\nbrother. This was something new, for Gania had been wont to look upon\\r\\nColia as a kind of errand-boy, treating him with contempt, threatening\\r\\nto â\\x80\\x9cpull his ears,â\\x80\\x9d and in general driving him almost wild with\\r\\nirritation. It seemed now that Gania really needed his brother, and the\\r\\nlatter, for his part, felt as if he could forgive Gania much since he\\r\\nhad returned the hundred thousand roubles offered to him by Nastasia\\r\\nPhilipovna. Three months after the departure of the prince, the Ivolgin\\r\\nfamily discovered that Colia had made acquaintance with the Epanchins,\\r\\nand was on very friendly terms with the daughters. Varia heard of it\\r\\nfirst, though Colia had not asked her to introduce him. Little by\\r\\nlittle the family grew quite fond of him. Madame Epanchin at first\\r\\nlooked on him with disdain, and received him coldly, but in a short\\r\\ntime he grew to please her, because, as she said, he â\\x80\\x9cwas candid and no\\r\\nflattererâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94a very true description. From the first he put himself on an\\r\\nequality with his new friends, and though he sometimes read newspapers\\r\\nand books to the mistress of the house, it was simply because he liked\\r\\nto be useful.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day, however, he and Lizabetha Prokofievna quarrelled seriously\\r\\nabout the â\\x80\\x9cwoman question,â\\x80\\x9d in the course of a lively discussion on\\r\\nthat burning subject. He told her that she was a tyrant, and that he\\r\\nwould never set foot in her house again. It may seem incredible, but a\\r\\nday or two after, Madame Epanchin sent a servant with a note begging\\r\\nhim to return, and Colia, without standing on his dignity, did so at\\r\\nonce.\\r\\n\\r\\nAglaya was the only one of the family whose good graces he could not\\r\\ngain, and who always spoke to him haughtily, but it so happened that\\r\\nthe boy one day succeeded in giving the proud maiden a surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was about Easter, when, taking advantage of a momentary tÃªte-Ã\\xa0-tÃªte\\r\\nColia handed Aglaya a letter, remarking that he â\\x80\\x9chad orders to deliver\\r\\nit to her privately.â\\x80\\x9d She stared at him in amazement, but he did not\\r\\nwait to hear what she had to say, and went out. Aglaya broke the seal,\\r\\nand read as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOnce you did me the honour of giving me your confidence. Perhaps you\\r\\nhave quite forgotten me now! How is it that I am writing to you? I do\\r\\nnot know; but I am conscious of an irresistible desire to remind you of\\r\\nmy existence, especially you. How many times I have needed all three of\\r\\nyou; but only you have dwelt always in my mindâ\\x80\\x99s eye. I need youâ\\x80\\x94I need\\r\\nyou very much. I will not write about myself. I have nothing to tell\\r\\nyou. But I long for you to be happy. _Are_ you happy? That is all I\\r\\nwished to say to youâ\\x80\\x94Your brother,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPr. L. Muishkin.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn reading this short and disconnected note, Aglaya suddenly blushed\\r\\nall over, and became very thoughtful.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would be difficult to describe her thoughts at that moment. One of\\r\\nthem was, â\\x80\\x9cShall I show it to anyone?â\\x80\\x9d But she was ashamed to show it.\\r\\nSo she ended by hiding it in her table drawer, with a very strange,\\r\\nironical smile upon her lips.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext day, she took it out, and put it into a large book, as she usually\\r\\ndid with papers which she wanted to be able to find easily. She laughed\\r\\nwhen, about a week later, she happened to notice the name of the book,\\r\\nand saw that it was Don Quixote, but it would be difficult to say\\r\\nexactly why.\\r\\n\\r\\nI cannot say, either, whether she showed the letter to her sisters.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when she had read it herself once more, it suddenly struck her that\\r\\nsurely that conceited boy, Colia, had not been the one chosen\\r\\ncorrespondent of the prince all this while. She determined to ask him,\\r\\nand did so with an exaggerated show of carelessness. He informed her\\r\\nhaughtily that though he had given the prince his permanent address\\r\\nwhen the latter left town, and had offered his services, the prince had\\r\\nnever before given him any commission to perform, nor had he written\\r\\nuntil the following lines arrived, with Aglayaâ\\x80\\x99s letter. Aglaya took\\r\\nthe note, and read it.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDEAR COLIA,â\\x80\\x94Please be so kind as to give the enclosed sealed letter to\\r\\nAglaya Ivanovna. Keep wellâ\\x80\\x94Ever your loving,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPr. L. Muishkin.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt seems absurd to trust a little pepper-box like you,â\\x80\\x9d said Aglaya,\\r\\nas she returned the note, and walked past the â\\x80\\x9cpepper-boxâ\\x80\\x9d with an\\r\\nexpression of great contempt.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was more than Colia could bear. He had actually borrowed Ganiaâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nnew green tie for the occasion, without saying why he wanted it, in\\r\\norder to impress her. He was very deeply mortified.\\r\\n\\r\\nII.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the beginning of June, and for a whole week the weather in St.\\r\\nPetersburg had been magnificent. The Epanchins had a luxurious\\r\\ncountry-house at Pavlofsk, [One of the fashionable summer resorts near\\r\\nSt. Petersburg.] and to this spot Mrs. Epanchin determined to proceed\\r\\nwithout further delay. In a couple of days all was ready, and the\\r\\nfamily had left town. A day or two after this removal to Pavlofsk,\\r\\nPrince Muishkin arrived in St. Petersburg by the morning train from\\r\\nMoscow. No one met him; but, as he stepped out of the carriage, he\\r\\nsuddenly became aware of two strangely glowing eyes fixed upon him from\\r\\namong the crowd that met the train. On endeavouring to re-discover the\\r\\neyes, and see to whom they belonged, he could find nothing to guide\\r\\nhim. It must have been a hallucination. But the disagreeable impression\\r\\nremained, and without this, the prince was sad and thoughtful already,\\r\\nand seemed to be much preoccupied.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis cab took him to a small and bad hotel near the Litaynaya. Here he\\r\\nengaged a couple of rooms, dark and badly furnished. He washed and\\r\\nchanged, and hurriedly left the hotel again, as though anxious to waste\\r\\nno time. Anyone who now saw him for the first time since he left\\r\\nPetersburg would judge that he had improved vastly so far as his\\r\\nexterior was concerned. His clothes certainly were very different; they\\r\\nwere more fashionable, perhaps even too much so, and anyone inclined to\\r\\nmockery might have found something to smile at in his appearance. But\\r\\nwhat is there that people will not smile at?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince took a cab and drove to a street near the Nativity, where he\\r\\nsoon discovered the house he was seeking. It was a small wooden villa,\\r\\nand he was struck by its attractive and clean appearance; it stood in a\\r\\npleasant little garden, full of flowers. The windows looking on the\\r\\nstreet were open, and the sound of a voice, reading aloud or making a\\r\\nspeech, came through them. It rose at times to a shout, and was\\r\\ninterrupted occasionally by bursts of laughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrince Muishkin entered the court-yard, and ascended the steps. A cook\\r\\nwith her sleeves turned up to the elbows opened the door. The visitor\\r\\nasked if Mr. Lebedeff were at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe is in there,â\\x80\\x9d said she, pointing to the salon.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe room had a blue wall-paper, and was well, almost pretentiously,\\r\\nfurnished, with its round table, its divan, and its bronze clock under\\r\\na glass shade. There was a narrow pier-glass against the wall, and a\\r\\nchandelier adorned with lustres hung by a bronze chain from the\\r\\nceiling.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the prince entered, Lebedeff was standing in the middle of the\\r\\nroom, his back to the door. He was in his shirt-sleeves, on account of\\r\\nthe extreme heat, and he seemed to have just reached the peroration of\\r\\nhis speech, and was impressively beating his breast.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis audience consisted of a youth of about fifteen years of age with a\\r\\nclever face, who had a book in his hand, though he was not reading; a\\r\\nyoung lady of twenty, in deep mourning, stood near him with an infant\\r\\nin her arms; another girl of thirteen, also in black, was laughing\\r\\nloudly, her mouth wide open; and on the sofa lay a handsome young man,\\r\\nwith black hair and eyes, and a suspicion of beard and whiskers. He\\r\\nfrequently interrupted the speaker and argued with him, to the great\\r\\ndelight of the others.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLukian Timofeyovitch! Lukian Timofeyovitch! Hereâ\\x80\\x99s someone to see you!\\r\\nLook here!... a gentleman to speak to you!... Well, itâ\\x80\\x99s not my fault!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nand the cook turned and went away red with anger.\\r\\n\\r\\nLebedeff started, and at sight of the prince stood like a statue for a\\r\\nmoment. Then he moved up to him with an ingratiating smile, but stopped\\r\\nshort again.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPrince! ex-ex-excellency!â\\x80\\x9d he stammered. Then suddenly he ran towards\\r\\nthe girl with the infant, a movement so unexpected by her that she\\r\\nstaggered and fell back, but next moment he was threatening the other\\r\\nchild, who was standing, still laughing, in the doorway. She screamed,\\r\\nand ran towards the kitchen. Lebedeff stamped his foot angrily; then,\\r\\nseeing the prince regarding him with amazement, he murmured\\r\\napologeticallyâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cPardon to show respect!... he-he!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are quite wrong...â\\x80\\x9d began the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAt once... at once... in one moment!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe rushed like a whirlwind from the room, and Muishkin looked\\r\\ninquiringly at the others.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were all laughing, and the guest joined in the chorus.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe has gone to get his coat,â\\x80\\x9d said the boy.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow annoying!â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed the prince. â\\x80\\x9cI thought... Tell me, is he...â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou think he is drunk?â\\x80\\x9d cried the young man on the sofa. â\\x80\\x9cNot in the\\r\\nleast. Heâ\\x80\\x99s only had three or four small glasses, perhaps five; but\\r\\nwhat is that? The usual thing!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the prince opened his mouth to answer, he was interrupted by the\\r\\ngirl, whose sweet face wore an expression of absolute frankness.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe never drinks much in the morning; if you have come to talk business\\r\\nwith him, do it now. It is the best time. He sometimes comes back drunk\\r\\nin the evening; but just now he passes the greater part of the evening\\r\\nin tears, and reads passages of Holy Scripture aloud, because our\\r\\nmother died five weeks ago.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo doubt he ran off because he did not know what to say to you,â\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nthe youth on the divan. â\\x80\\x9cI bet he is trying to cheat you, and is\\r\\nthinking how best to do it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJust then Lebedeff returned, having put on his coat.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFive weeks!â\\x80\\x9d said he, wiping his eyes. â\\x80\\x9cOnly five weeks! Poor\\r\\norphans!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut why wear a coat in holes,â\\x80\\x9d asked the girl, â\\x80\\x9cwhen your new one is\\r\\nhanging behind the door? Did you not see it?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHold your tongue, dragon-fly!â\\x80\\x9d he scolded. â\\x80\\x9cWhat a plague you are!â\\x80\\x9d He\\r\\nstamped his foot irritably, but she only laughed, and answered:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAre you trying to frighten me? I am not Tania, you know, and I donâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nintend to run away. Look, you are waking Lubotchka, and she will have\\r\\nconvulsions again. Why do you shout like that?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, well! I wonâ\\x80\\x99t again,â\\x80\\x9d said the master of the house, his anxiety\\r\\ngetting the better of his temper. He went up to his daughter, and\\r\\nlooked at the child in her arms, anxiously making the sign of the cross\\r\\nover her three times. â\\x80\\x9cGod bless her! God bless her!â\\x80\\x9d he cried with\\r\\nemotion. â\\x80\\x9cThis little creature is my daughter Luboff,â\\x80\\x9d addressing the\\r\\nprince. â\\x80\\x9cMy wife, Helena, diedâ\\x80\\x94at her birth; and this is my big\\r\\ndaughter Vera, in mourning, as you see; and this, this, oh, this,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\npointing to the young man on the divan...\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, go on! never mind me!â\\x80\\x9d mocked the other. â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t be afraid!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExcellency! Have you read that account of the murder of the Zemarin\\r\\nfamily, in the newspaper?â\\x80\\x9d cried Lebedeff, all of a sudden.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d said Muishkin, with some surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, that is the murderer! It is heâ\\x80\\x94in factâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean?â\\x80\\x9d asked the visitor.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am speaking allegorically, of course; but he will be the murderer of\\r\\na Zemarin family in the future. He is getting ready. ...â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey all laughed, and the thought crossed the princeâ\\x80\\x99s mind that\\r\\nperhaps Lebedeff was really trifling in this way because he foresaw\\r\\ninconvenient questions, and wanted to gain time.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe is a traitor! a conspirator!â\\x80\\x9d shouted Lebedeff, who seemed to have\\r\\nlost all control over himself. â\\x80\\x9cA monster! a slanderer! Ought I to\\r\\ntreat him as a nephew, the son of my sister Anisia?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh! do be quiet! You must be drunk! He has taken it into his head to\\r\\nplay the lawyer, prince, and he practices speechifying, and is always\\r\\nrepeating his eloquent pleadings to his children. And who do you think\\r\\nwas his last client? An old woman who had been robbed of five hundred\\r\\nroubles, her all, by some rogue of a usurer, besought him to take up\\r\\nher case, instead of which he defended the usurer himself, a Jew named\\r\\nZeidler, because this Jew promised to give him fifty roubles....â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was to be fifty if I won the case, only five if I lost,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\ninterrupted Lebedeff, speaking in a low tone, a great contrast to his\\r\\nearlier manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell! naturally he came to grief: the law is not administered as it\\r\\nused to be, and he only got laughed at for his pains. But he was much\\r\\npleased with himself in spite of that. â\\x80\\x98Most learned judge!â\\x80\\x99 said he,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98picture this unhappy man, crippled by age and infirmities, who gains\\r\\nhis living by honourable toilâ\\x80\\x94picture him, I repeat, robbed of his all,\\r\\nof his last mouthful; remember, I entreat you, the words of that\\r\\nlearned legislator, â\\x80\\x9cLet mercy and justice alike rule the courts of\\r\\nlaw.â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x99 Now, would you believe it, excellency, every morning he recites\\r\\nthis speech to us from beginning to end, exactly as he spoke it before\\r\\nthe magistrate. To-day we have heard it for the fifth time. He was just\\r\\nstarting again when you arrived, so much does he admire it. He is now\\r\\npreparing to undertake another case. I think, by the way, that you are\\r\\nPrince Muishkin? Colia tells me you are the cleverest man he has ever\\r\\nknown....â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe cleverest in the world,â\\x80\\x9d interrupted his uncle hastily.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI do not pay much attention to that opinion,â\\x80\\x9d continued the young man\\r\\ncalmly. â\\x80\\x9cColia is very fond of you, but he,â\\x80\\x9d pointing to Lebedeff, â\\x80\\x9cis\\r\\nflattering you. I can assure you I have no intention of flattering you,\\r\\nor anyone else, but at least you have some common-sense. Well, will you\\r\\njudge between us? Shall we ask the prince to act as arbitrator?â\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nwent on, addressing his uncle.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am so glad you chanced to come here, prince.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI agree,â\\x80\\x9d said Lebedeff, firmly, looking round involuntarily at his\\r\\ndaughter, who had come nearer, and was listening attentively to the\\r\\nconversation.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat is it all about?â\\x80\\x9d asked the prince, frowning. His head ached, and\\r\\nhe felt sure that Lebedeff was trying to cheat him in some way, and\\r\\nonly talking to put off the explanation that he had come for.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI will tell you all the story. I am his nephew; he did speak the truth\\r\\nthere, although he is generally telling lies. I am at the University,\\r\\nand have not yet finished my course. I mean to do so, and I shall, for\\r\\nI have a determined character. I must, however, find something to do\\r\\nfor the present, and therefore I have got employment on the railway at\\r\\ntwenty-four roubles a month. I admit that my uncle has helped me once\\r\\nor twice before. Well, I had twenty roubles in my pocket, and I gambled\\r\\nthem away. Can you believe that I should be so low, so base, as to lose\\r\\nmoney in that way?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd the man who won it is a rogue, a rogue whom you ought not to have\\r\\npaid!â\\x80\\x9d cried Lebedeff.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, he is a rogue, but I was obliged to pay him,â\\x80\\x9d said the young man.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAs to his being a rogue, he is assuredly that, and I am not saying it\\r\\nbecause he beat you. He is an ex-lieutenant, prince, dismissed from the\\r\\nservice, a teacher of boxing, and one of Rogojinâ\\x80\\x99s followers. They are\\r\\nall lounging about the pavements now that Rogojin has turned them off.\\r\\nOf course, the worst of it is that, knowing he was a rascal, and a\\r\\ncard-sharper, I none the less played palki with him, and risked my last\\r\\nrouble. To tell the truth, I thought to myself, â\\x80\\x98If I lose, I will go\\r\\nto my uncle, and I am sure he will not refuse to help me.â\\x80\\x99 Now that was\\r\\nbaseâ\\x80\\x94cowardly and base!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is so,â\\x80\\x9d observed Lebedeff quietly; â\\x80\\x9ccowardly and base.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, wait a bit, before you begin to triumph,â\\x80\\x9d said the nephew\\r\\nviciously; for the words seemed to irritate him. â\\x80\\x9cHe is delighted! I\\r\\ncame to him here and told him everything: I acted honourably, for I did\\r\\nnot excuse myself. I spoke most severely of my conduct, as everyone\\r\\nhere can witness. But I must smarten myself up before I take up my new\\r\\npost, for I am really like a tramp. Just look at my boots! I cannot\\r\\npossibly appear like this, and if I am not at the bureau at the time\\r\\nappointed, the job will be given to someone else; and I shall have to\\r\\ntry for another. Now I only beg for fifteen roubles, and I give my word\\r\\nthat I will never ask him for anything again. I am also ready to\\r\\npromise to repay my debt in three monthsâ\\x80\\x99 time, and I will keep my\\r\\nword, even if I have to live on bread and water. My salary will amount\\r\\nto seventy-five roubles in three months. The sum I now ask, added to\\r\\nwhat I have borrowed already, will make a total of about thirty-five\\r\\nroubles, so you see I shall have enough to pay him and confound him! if\\r\\nhe wants interest, he shall have that, too! Havenâ\\x80\\x99t I always paid back\\r\\nthe money he lent me before? Why should he be so mean now? He grudges\\r\\nmy having paid that lieutenant; there can be no other reason! Thatâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nthe kind he isâ\\x80\\x94a dog in the manger!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd he wonâ\\x80\\x99t go away!â\\x80\\x9d cried Lebedeff. â\\x80\\x9cHe has installed himself here,\\r\\nand here he remains!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have told you already, that I will not go away until I have got what\\r\\nI ask. Why are you smiling, prince? You look as if you disapproved of\\r\\nme.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am not smiling, but I really think you are in the wrong, somewhat,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nreplied Muishkin, reluctantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t shuffle! Say plainly that you think that I am quite wrong,\\r\\nwithout any â\\x80\\x98somewhatâ\\x80\\x99! Why â\\x80\\x98somewhatâ\\x80\\x99?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI will say you are quite wrong, if you wish.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf I wish! Thatâ\\x80\\x99s good, I must say! Do you think I am deceived as to\\r\\nthe flagrant impropriety of my conduct? I am quite aware that his money\\r\\nis his own, and that my actionâ\\x80\\x94is much like an attempt at extortion.\\r\\nBut you-you donâ\\x80\\x99t know what life is! If people donâ\\x80\\x99t learn by\\r\\nexperience, they never understand. They must be taught. My intentions\\r\\nare perfectly honest; on my conscience he will lose nothing, and I will\\r\\npay back the money with interest. Added to which he has had the moral\\r\\nsatisfaction of seeing me disgraced. What does he want more? and what\\r\\nis he good for if he never helps anyone? Look what he does himself!\\r\\njust ask him about his dealings with others, how he deceives people!\\r\\nHow did he manage to buy this house? You may cut off my head if he has\\r\\nnot let you in for somethingâ\\x80\\x94and if he is not trying to cheat you\\r\\nagain. You are smiling. You donâ\\x80\\x99t believe me?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt seems to me that all this has nothing to do with your affairs,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nremarked the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have lain here now for three days,â\\x80\\x9d cried the young man without\\r\\nnoticing, â\\x80\\x9cand I have seen a lot! Fancy! he suspects his daughter, that\\r\\nangel, that orphan, my cousinâ\\x80\\x94he suspects her, and every evening he\\r\\nsearches her room, to see if she has a lover hidden in it! He comes\\r\\nhere too on tiptoe, creeping softlyâ\\x80\\x94oh, so softlyâ\\x80\\x94and looks under the\\r\\nsofaâ\\x80\\x94my bed, you know. He is mad with suspicion, and sees a thief in\\r\\nevery corner. He runs about all night long; he was up at least seven\\r\\ntimes last night, to satisfy himself that the windows and doors were\\r\\nbarred, and to peep into the oven. That man who appears in court for\\r\\nscoundrels, rushes in here in the night and prays, lying prostrate,\\r\\nbanging his head on the ground by the half-hourâ\\x80\\x94and for whom do you\\r\\nthink he prays? Who are the sinners figuring in his drunken petitions?\\r\\nI have heard him with my own ears praying for the repose of the soul of\\r\\nthe Countess du Barry! Colia heard it too. He is as mad as a March\\r\\nhare!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou hear how he slanders me, prince,â\\x80\\x9d said Lebedeff, almost beside\\r\\nhimself with rage. â\\x80\\x9cI may be a drunkard, an evil-doer, a thief, but at\\r\\nleast I can say one thing for myself. He does not knowâ\\x80\\x94how should he,\\r\\nmocker that he is?â\\x80\\x94that when he came into the world it was I who washed\\r\\nhim, and dressed him in his swathing-bands, for my sister Anisia had\\r\\nlost her husband, and was in great poverty. I was very little better\\r\\noff than she, but I sat up night after night with her, and nursed both\\r\\nmother and child; I used to go downstairs and steal wood for them from\\r\\nthe house-porter. How often did I sing him to sleep when I was half\\r\\ndead with hunger! In short, I was more than a father to him, and\\r\\nnowâ\\x80\\x94now he jeers at me! Even if I did cross myself, and pray for the\\r\\nrepose of the soul of the Comtesse du Barry, what does it matter? Three\\r\\ndays ago, for the first time in my life, I read her biography in an\\r\\nhistorical dictionary. Do you know who she was? You there!â\\x80\\x9d addressing\\r\\nhis nephew. â\\x80\\x9cSpeak! do you know?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course no one knows anything about her but you,â\\x80\\x9d muttered the young\\r\\nman in a would-be jeering tone.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe was a Countess who rose from shame to reign like a Queen. An\\r\\nEmpress wrote to her, with her own hand, as â\\x80\\x98_Ma chÃ¨re cousine_.â\\x80\\x99 At a\\r\\n_lever-du-roi_ one morning (do you know what a _lever-du-roi_ was?)â\\x80\\x94a\\r\\nCardinal, a Papal legate, offered to put on her stockings; a high and\\r\\nholy person like that looked on it as an honour! Did you know this? I\\r\\nsee by your expression that you did not! Well, how did she die?\\r\\nAnswer!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh! do stopâ\\x80\\x94you are too absurd!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis is how she died. After all this honour and glory, after having\\r\\nbeen almost a Queen, she was guillotined by that butcher, Samson. She\\r\\nwas quite innocent, but it had to be done, for the satisfaction of the\\r\\nfishwives of Paris. She was so terrified, that she did not understand\\r\\nwhat was happening. But when Samson seized her head, and pushed her\\r\\nunder the knife with his foot, she cried out: â\\x80\\x98Wait a moment! wait a\\r\\nmoment, monsieur!â\\x80\\x99 Well, because of that moment of bitter suffering,\\r\\nperhaps the Saviour will pardon her other faults, for one cannot\\r\\nimagine a greater agony. As I read the story my heart bled for her. And\\r\\nwhat does it matter to you, little worm, if I implored the Divine mercy\\r\\nfor her, great sinner as she was, as I said my evening prayer? I might\\r\\nhave done it because I doubted if anyone had ever crossed himself for\\r\\nher sake before. It may be that in the other world she will rejoice to\\r\\nthink that a sinner like herself has cried to heaven for the salvation\\r\\nof her soul. Why are you laughing? You believe nothing, atheist! And\\r\\nyour story was not even correct! If you had listened to what I was\\r\\nsaying, you would have heard that I did not only pray for the Comtesse\\r\\ndu Barry. I said, â\\x80\\x98Oh Lord! give rest to the soul of that great sinner,\\r\\nthe Comtesse du Barry, and to all unhappy ones like her.â\\x80\\x99 You see that\\r\\nis quite a different thing, for how many sinners there are, how many\\r\\nwomen, who have passed through the trials of this life, are now\\r\\nsuffering and groaning in purgatory! I prayed for you, too, in spite of\\r\\nyour insolence and impudence, also for your fellows, as it seems that\\r\\nyou claim to know how I pray...â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh! thatâ\\x80\\x99s enough in all conscience! Pray for whom you choose, and the\\r\\ndevil take them and you! We have a scholar here; you did not know that,\\r\\nprince?â\\x80\\x9d he continued, with a sneer. â\\x80\\x9cHe reads all sorts of books and\\r\\nmemoirs now.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAt any rate, your uncle has a kind heart,â\\x80\\x9d remarked the prince, who\\r\\nreally had to force himself to speak to the nephew, so much did he\\r\\ndislike him.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, now you are going to praise him! He will be set up! He puts his\\r\\nhand on his heart, and he is delighted! I never said he was a man\\r\\nwithout heart, but he is a rascalâ\\x80\\x94thatâ\\x80\\x99s the pity of it. And then, he\\r\\nis addicted to drink, and his mind is unhinged, like that of most\\r\\npeople who have taken more than is good for them for years. He loves\\r\\nhis childrenâ\\x80\\x94oh, I know that well enough! He respected my aunt, his\\r\\nlate wife... and he even has a sort of affection for me. He has\\r\\nremembered me in his will.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI shall leave you nothing!â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed his uncle angrily.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cListen to me, Lebedeff,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince in a decided voice, turning\\r\\nhis back on the young man. â\\x80\\x9cI know by experience that when you choose,\\r\\nyou can be business-like... I have very little time to spare, and if\\r\\nyou... By the wayâ\\x80\\x94excuse meâ\\x80\\x94what is your Christian name? I have\\r\\nforgotten it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTi-Ti-Timofey.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLukianovitch.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEveryone in the room began to laugh.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe is telling lies!â\\x80\\x9d cried the nephew. â\\x80\\x9cEven now he cannot speak the\\r\\ntruth. He is not called Timofey Lukianovitch, prince, but Lukian\\r\\nTimofeyovitch. Now do tell us why you must needs lie about it? Lukian\\r\\nor Timofey, it is all the same to you, and what difference can it make\\r\\nto the prince? He tells lies without the least necessity, simply by\\r\\nforce of habit, I assure you.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs that true?â\\x80\\x9d said the prince impatiently.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy name really is Lukian Timofeyovitch,â\\x80\\x9d acknowledged Lebedeff,\\r\\nlowering his eyes, and putting his hand on his heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, for Godâ\\x80\\x99s sake, what made you say the other?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTo humble myself,â\\x80\\x9d murmured Lebedeff.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat on earth do you mean? Oh I if only I knew where Colia was at this\\r\\nmoment!â\\x80\\x9d cried the prince, standing up, as if to go.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI can tell you all about Colia,â\\x80\\x9d said the young man\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh! no, no!â\\x80\\x9d said Lebedeff, hurriedly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cColia spent the night here, and this morning went after his father,\\r\\nwhom you let out of prison by paying his debtsâ\\x80\\x94Heaven only knows why!\\r\\nYesterday the general promised to come and lodge here, but he did not\\r\\nappear. Most probably he slept at the hotel close by. No doubt Colia is\\r\\nthere, unless he has gone to Pavlofsk to see the Epanchins. He had a\\r\\nlittle money, and was intending to go there yesterday. He must be\\r\\neither at the hotel or at Pavlofsk.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAt Pavlofsk! He is at Pavlofsk, undoubtedly!â\\x80\\x9d interrupted Lebedeff....\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut comeâ\\x80\\x94let us go into the gardenâ\\x80\\x94we will have coffee there....â\\x80\\x9d And\\r\\nLebedeff seized the princeâ\\x80\\x99s arm, and led him from the room. They went\\r\\nacross the yard, and found themselves in a delightful little garden\\r\\nwith the trees already in their summer dress of green, thanks to the\\r\\nunusually fine weather. Lebedeff invited his guest to sit down on a\\r\\ngreen seat before a table of the same colour fixed in the earth, and\\r\\ntook a seat facing him. In a few minutes the coffee appeared, and the\\r\\nprince did not refuse it. The host kept his eyes fixed on Muishkin,\\r\\nwith an expression of passionate servility.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI knew nothing about your home before,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince absently, as\\r\\nif he were thinking of something else.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPoor orphans,â\\x80\\x9d began Lebedeff, his face assuming a mournful air, but\\r\\nhe stopped short, for the other looked at him inattentively, as if he\\r\\nhad already forgotten his own remark. They waited a few minutes in\\r\\nsilence, while Lebedeff sat with his eyes fixed mournfully on the young\\r\\nmanâ\\x80\\x99s face.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell!â\\x80\\x9d said the latter, at last rousing himself. â\\x80\\x9cAh! yes! You know\\r\\nwhy I came, Lebedeff. Your letter brought me. Speak! Tell me all about\\r\\nit.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe clerk, rather confused, tried to say something, hesitated, began to\\r\\nspeak, and again stopped. The prince looked at him gravely.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think I understand, Lukian Timofeyovitch: you were not sure that I\\r\\nshould come. You did not think I should start at the first word from\\r\\nyou, and you merely wrote to relieve your conscience. However, you see\\r\\nnow that I have come, and I have had enough of trickery. Give up\\r\\nserving, or trying to serve, two masters. Rogojin has been here these\\r\\nthree weeks. Have you managed to sell her to him as you did before?\\r\\nTell me the truth.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe discovered everything, the monster... himself......â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t abuse him; though I dare say you have something to complain\\r\\nof....â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe beat me, he thrashed me unmercifully!â\\x80\\x9d replied Lebedeff vehemently.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe set a dog on me in Moscow, a bloodhound, a terrible beast that\\r\\nchased me all down the street.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou seem to take me for a child, Lebedeff. Tell me, is it a fact that\\r\\nshe left him while they were in Moscow?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, it is a fact, and this time, let me tell you, on the very eve of\\r\\ntheir marriage! It was a question of minutes when she slipped off to\\r\\nPetersburg. She came to me directly she arrivedâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98Save me, Lukian! find\\r\\nme some refuge, and say nothing to the prince!â\\x80\\x99 She is afraid of you,\\r\\neven more than she is of him, and in that she shows her wisdom!â\\x80\\x9d And\\r\\nLebedeff slily put his finger to his brow as he said the last words.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd now it is you who have brought them together again?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExcellency, how could I, how could I prevent it?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat will do. I can find out for myself. Only tell me, where is she\\r\\nnow? At his house? With him?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh no! Certainly not! â\\x80\\x98I am free,â\\x80\\x99 she says; you know how she insists\\r\\non that point. â\\x80\\x98I am entirely free.â\\x80\\x99 She repeats it over and over\\r\\nagain. She is living in Petersburgskaia, with my sister-in-law, as I\\r\\ntold you in my letter.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe is there at this moment?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, unless she has gone to Pavlofsk: the fine weather may have\\r\\ntempted her, perhaps, into the country, with Daria Alexeyevna. â\\x80\\x98I am\\r\\nquite free,â\\x80\\x99 she says. Only yesterday she boasted of her freedom to\\r\\nNicolai Ardalionovitchâ\\x80\\x94a bad sign,â\\x80\\x9d added Lebedeff, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cColia goes to see her often, does he not?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe is a strange boy, thoughtless, and inclined to be indiscreet.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs it long since you saw her?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI go to see her every day, every day.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen you were there yesterday?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cN-no: I have not been these three last days.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is a pity you have taken too much wine, Lebedeff I want to ask you\\r\\nsomething... but...â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAll right! all right! I am not drunk,â\\x80\\x9d replied the clerk, preparing to\\r\\nlisten.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTell me, how was she when you left her?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe is a woman who is seeking...â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSeeking?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe seems always to be searching about, as if she had lost something.\\r\\nThe mere idea of her coming marriage disgusts her; she looks on it as\\r\\nan insult. She cares as much for _him_ as for a piece of\\r\\norange-peelâ\\x80\\x94not more. Yet I am much mistaken if she does not look on\\r\\nhim with fear and trembling. She forbids his name to be mentioned\\r\\nbefore her, and they only meet when unavoidable. He understands, well\\r\\nenough! But it must be gone through. She is restless, mocking,\\r\\ndeceitful, violent....â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDeceitful and violent?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, violent. I can give you a proof of it. A few days ago she tried\\r\\nto pull my hair because I said something that annoyed her. I tried to\\r\\nsoothe her by reading the Apocalypse aloud.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat?â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed the prince, thinking he had not heard aright.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBy reading the Apocalypse. The lady has a restless imagination, he-he!\\r\\nShe has a liking for conversation on serious subjects, of any kind; in\\r\\nfact they please her so much, that it flatters her to discuss them. Now\\r\\nfor fifteen years at least I have studied the Apocalypse, and she\\r\\nagrees with me in thinking that the present is the epoch represented by\\r\\nthe third horse, the black one whose rider holds a measure in his hand.\\r\\nIt seems to me that everything is ruled by measure in our century; all\\r\\nmen are clamouring for their rights; â\\x80\\x98a measure of wheat for a penny,\\r\\nand three measures of barley for a penny.â\\x80\\x99 But, added to this, men\\r\\ndesire freedom of mind and body, a pure heart, a healthy life, and all\\r\\nGodâ\\x80\\x99s good gifts. Now by pleading their rights alone, they will never\\r\\nattain all this, so the white horse, with his rider Death, comes next,\\r\\nand is followed by Hell. We talked about this matter when we met, and\\r\\nit impressed her very much.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you believe all this?â\\x80\\x9d asked Muishkin, looking curiously at his\\r\\ncompanion.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI both believe it and explain it. I am but a poor creature, a beggar,\\r\\nan atom in the scale of humanity. Who has the least respect for\\r\\nLebedeff? He is a target for all the world, the butt of any fool who\\r\\nchooses to kick him. But in interpreting revelation I am the equal of\\r\\nanyone, great as he may be! Such is the power of the mind and the\\r\\nspirit. I have made a lordly personage tremble, as he sat in his\\r\\narmchair... only by talking to him of things concerning the spirit. Two\\r\\nyears ago, on Easter Eve, His Excellency Nil Alexeyovitch, whose\\r\\nsubordinate I was then, wished to hear what I had to say, and sent a\\r\\nmessage by Peter Zakkaritch to ask me to go to his private room. â\\x80\\x98They\\r\\ntell me you expound the prophecies relating to Antichrist,â\\x80\\x99 said he,\\r\\nwhen we were alone. â\\x80\\x98Is that so?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Yes,â\\x80\\x99 I answered unhesitatingly, and\\r\\nI began to give some comments on the Apostleâ\\x80\\x99s allegorical vision. At\\r\\nfirst he smiled, but when we reached the numerical computations and\\r\\ncorrespondences, he trembled, and turned pale. Then he begged me to\\r\\nclose the book, and sent me away, promising to put my name on the\\r\\nreward list. That took place as I said on the eve of Easter, and eight\\r\\ndays later his soul returned to God.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is the truth. One evening after dinner he stumbled as he stepped\\r\\nout of his carriage. He fell, and struck his head on the curb, and died\\r\\nimmediately. He was seventy-three years of age, and had a red face, and\\r\\nwhite hair; he deluged himself with scent, and was always smiling like\\r\\na child. Peter Zakkaritch recalled my interview with him, and said,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98_you foretold his death._â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince rose from his seat, and Lebedeff, surprised to see his guest\\r\\npreparing to go so soon, remarked: â\\x80\\x9cYou are not interested?â\\x80\\x9d in a\\r\\nrespectful tone.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am not very well, and my head aches. Doubtless the effect of the\\r\\njourney,â\\x80\\x9d replied the prince, frowning.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou should go into the country,â\\x80\\x9d said Lebedeff timidly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince seemed to be considering the suggestion.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou see, I am going into the country myself in three days, with my\\r\\nchildren and belongings. The little one is delicate; she needs change\\r\\nof air; and during our absence this house will be done up. I am going\\r\\nto Pavlofsk.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are going to Pavlofsk too?â\\x80\\x9d asked the prince sharply. â\\x80\\x9cEverybody\\r\\nseems to be going there. Have you a house in that neighbourhood?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know of many people going to Pavlofsk, and as for the house,\\r\\nIvan Ptitsin has let me one of his villas rather cheaply. It is a\\r\\npleasant place, lying on a hill surrounded by trees, and one can live\\r\\nthere for a mere song. There is good music to be heard, so no wonder it\\r\\nis popular. I shall stay in the lodge. As to the villa itself...â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHave you let it?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cN-noâ\\x80\\x94not exactly.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLet it to me,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow this was precisely what Lebedeff had made up his mind to do in the\\r\\nlast three minutes. Not that he had any difficulty in finding a tenant;\\r\\nin fact the house was occupied at present by a chance visitor, who had\\r\\ntold Lebedeff that he would perhaps take it for the summer months. The\\r\\nclerk knew very well that this â\\x80\\x9c_perhaps_â\\x80\\x9d meant â\\x80\\x9c_certainly_,â\\x80\\x9d but as\\r\\nhe thought he could make more out of a tenant like the prince, he felt\\r\\njustified in speaking vaguely about the present inhabitantâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nintentions. â\\x80\\x9cThis is quite a coincidence,â\\x80\\x9d thought he, and when the\\r\\nsubject of price was mentioned, he made a gesture with his hand, as if\\r\\nto waive away a question of so little importance.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh well, as you like!â\\x80\\x9d said Muishkin. â\\x80\\x9cI will think it over. You shall\\r\\nlose nothing!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were walking slowly across the garden.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut if you... I could...â\\x80\\x9d stammered Lebedeff, â\\x80\\x9cif... if you please,\\r\\nprince, tell you something on the subject which would interest you, I\\r\\nam sure.â\\x80\\x9d He spoke in wheedling tones, and wriggled as he walked along.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuishkin stopped short.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDaria Alexeyevna also has a villa at Pavlofsk.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA certain person is very friendly with her, and intends to visit her\\r\\npretty often.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAglaya Ivanovna...â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh stop, Lebedeff!â\\x80\\x9d interposed Muishkin, feeling as if he had been\\r\\ntouched on an open wound. â\\x80\\x9cThat... that has nothing to do with me. I\\r\\nshould like to know when you are going to start. The sooner the better\\r\\nas far as I am concerned, for I am at an hotel.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had left the garden now, and were crossing the yard on their way\\r\\nto the gate.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, leave your hotel at once and come here; then we can all go\\r\\ntogether to Pavlofsk the day after tomorrow.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI will think about it,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince dreamily, and went off.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe clerk stood looking after his guest, struck by his sudden\\r\\nabsent-mindedness. He had not even remembered to say goodbye, and\\r\\nLebedeff was the more surprised at the omission, as he knew by\\r\\nexperience how courteous the prince usually was.\\r\\n\\r\\nIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was now close on twelve oâ\\x80\\x99clock.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince knew that if he called at the Epanchinsâ\\x80\\x99 now he would only\\r\\nfind the general, and that the latter might probably carry him straight\\r\\noff to Pavlofsk with him; whereas there was one visit he was most\\r\\nanxious to make without delay.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo at the risk of missing General Epanchin altogether, and thus\\r\\npostponing his visit to Pavlofsk for a day, at least, the prince\\r\\ndecided to go and look for the house he desired to find.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe visit he was about to pay was, in some respects, a risky one. He\\r\\nwas in two minds about it, but knowing that the house was in the\\r\\nGorohovaya, not far from the Sadovaya, he determined to go in that\\r\\ndirection, and to try to make up his mind on the way.\\r\\n\\r\\nArrived at the point where the Gorohovaya crosses the Sadovaya, he was\\r\\nsurprised to find how excessively agitated he was. He had no idea that\\r\\nhis heart could beat so painfully.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne house in the Gorohovaya began to attract his attention long before\\r\\nhe reached it, and the prince remembered afterwards that he had said to\\r\\nhimself: â\\x80\\x9cThat is the house, Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure of it.â\\x80\\x9d He came up to it quite\\r\\ncurious to discover whether he had guessed right, and felt that he\\r\\nwould be disagreeably impressed to find that he had actually done so.\\r\\nThe house was a large gloomy-looking structure, without the slightest\\r\\nclaim to architectural beauty, in colour a dirty green. There are a few\\r\\nof these old houses, built towards the end of the last century, still\\r\\nstanding in that part of St. Petersburg, and showing little change from\\r\\ntheir original form and colour. They are solidly built, and are\\r\\nremarkable for the thickness of their walls, and for the fewness of\\r\\ntheir windows, many of which are covered by gratings. On the\\r\\nground-floor there is usually a money-changerâ\\x80\\x99s shop, and the owner\\r\\nlives over it. Without as well as within, the houses seem inhospitable\\r\\nand mysteriousâ\\x80\\x94an impression which is difficult to explain, unless it\\r\\nhas something to do with the actual architectural style. These houses\\r\\nare almost exclusively inhabited by the merchant class.\\r\\n\\r\\nArrived at the gate, the prince looked up at the legend over it, which\\r\\nran:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHouse of Rogojin, hereditary and honourable citizen.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe hesitated no longer; but opened the glazed door at the bottom of the\\r\\nouter stairs and made his way up to the second storey. The place was\\r\\ndark and gloomy-looking; the walls of the stone staircase were painted\\r\\na dull red. Rogojin and his mother and brother occupied the whole of\\r\\nthe second floor. The servant who opened the door to Muishkin led him,\\r\\nwithout taking his name, through several rooms and up and down many\\r\\nsteps until they arrived at a door, where he knocked.\\r\\n\\r\\nParfen Rogojin opened the door himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn seeing the prince he became deadly white, and apparently fixed to\\r\\nthe ground, so that he was more like a marble statue than a human\\r\\nbeing. The prince had expected some surprise, but Rogojin evidently\\r\\nconsidered his visit an impossible and miraculous event. He stared with\\r\\nan expression almost of terror, and his lips twisted into a bewildered\\r\\nsmile.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cParfen! perhaps my visit is ill-timed. Iâ\\x80\\x94I can go away again if you\\r\\nlike,â\\x80\\x9d said Muishkin at last, rather embarrassed.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, no; itâ\\x80\\x99s all right, come in,â\\x80\\x9d said Parfen, recollecting himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were evidently on quite familiar terms. In Moscow they had had\\r\\nmany occasions of meeting; indeed, some few of those meetings were but\\r\\ntoo vividly impressed upon their memories. They had not met now,\\r\\nhowever, for three months.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe deathlike pallor, and a sort of slight convulsion about the lips,\\r\\nhad not left Rogojinâ\\x80\\x99s face. Though he welcomed his guest, he was still\\r\\nobviously much disturbed. As he invited the prince to sit down near the\\r\\ntable, the latter happened to turn towards him, and was startled by the\\r\\nstrange expression on his face. A painful recollection flashed into his\\r\\nmind. He stood for a time, looking straight at Rogojin, whose eyes\\r\\nseemed to blaze like fire. At last Rogojin smiled, though he still\\r\\nlooked agitated and shaken.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat are you staring at me like that for?â\\x80\\x9d he muttered. â\\x80\\x9cSit down.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince took a chair.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cParfen,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9ctell me honestly, did you know that I was coming to\\r\\nPetersburg or no?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, I supposed you were coming,â\\x80\\x9d the other replied, smiling\\r\\nsarcastically, â\\x80\\x9cand I was right in my supposition, you see; but how was\\r\\nI to know that you would come _today?_â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA certain strangeness and impatience in his manner impressed the prince\\r\\nvery forcibly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd if you had known that I was coming today, why be so irritated\\r\\nabout it?â\\x80\\x9d he asked, in quiet surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy did you ask me?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBecause when I jumped out of the train this morning, two eyes glared\\r\\nat me just as yours did a moment since.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHa! and whose eyes may they have been?â\\x80\\x9d said Rogojin, suspiciously. It\\r\\nseemed to the prince that he was trembling.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know; I thought it was a hallucination. I often have\\r\\nhallucinations nowadays. I feel just as I did five years ago when my\\r\\nfits were about to come on.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, perhaps it was a hallucination, I donâ\\x80\\x99t know,â\\x80\\x9d said Parfen.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe tried to give the prince an affectionate smile, and it seemed to the\\r\\nlatter as though in this smile of his something had broken, and that he\\r\\ncould not mend it, try as he would.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShall you go abroad again then?â\\x80\\x9d he asked, and suddenly added, â\\x80\\x9cDo you\\r\\nremember how we came up in the train from Pskoff together? You and your\\r\\ncloak and leggings, eh?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Rogojin burst out laughing, this time with unconcealed malice, as\\r\\nthough he were glad that he had been able to find an opportunity for\\r\\ngiving vent to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHave you quite taken up your quarters here?â\\x80\\x9d asked the prince\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, Iâ\\x80\\x99m at home. Where else should I go to?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe havenâ\\x80\\x99t met for some time. Meanwhile I have heard things about you\\r\\nwhich I should not have believed to be possible.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat of that? People will say anything,â\\x80\\x9d said Rogojin drily.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAt all events, youâ\\x80\\x99ve disbanded your troopâ\\x80\\x94and you are living in your\\r\\nown house instead of being fast and loose about the place; thatâ\\x80\\x99s all\\r\\nvery good. Is this house all yours, or joint property?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is my motherâ\\x80\\x99s. You get to her apartments by that passage.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhereâ\\x80\\x99s your brother?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn the other wing.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs he married?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWidower. Why do you want to know all this?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince looked at him, but said nothing. He had suddenly relapsed\\r\\ninto musing, and had probably not heard the question at all. Rogojin\\r\\ndid not insist upon an answer, and there was silence for a few moments.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI guessed which was your house from a hundred yards off,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\r\\nprince at last.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy so?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t quite know. Your house has the aspect of yourself and all your\\r\\nfamily; it bears the stamp of the Rogojin life; but ask me why I think\\r\\nso, and I can tell you nothing. It is nonsense, of course. I am nervous\\r\\nabout this kind of thing troubling me so much. I had never before\\r\\nimagined what sort of a house you would live in, and yet no sooner did\\r\\nI set eyes on this one than I said to myself that it must be yours.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cReally!â\\x80\\x9d said Rogojin vaguely, not taking in what the prince meant by\\r\\nhis rather obscure remarks.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe room they were now sitting in was a large one, lofty but dark, well\\r\\nfurnished, principally with writing-tables and desks covered with\\r\\npapers and books. A wide sofa covered with red morocco evidently served\\r\\nRogojin for a bed. On the table beside which the prince had been\\r\\ninvited to seat himself lay some books; one containing a marker where\\r\\nthe reader had left off, was a volume of Solovieffâ\\x80\\x99s History. Some\\r\\noil-paintings in worn gilded frames hung on the walls, but it was\\r\\nimpossible to make out what subjects they represented, so blackened\\r\\nwere they by smoke and age. One, a life-sized portrait, attracted the\\r\\nprinceâ\\x80\\x99s attention. It showed a man of about fifty, wearing a long\\r\\nriding-coat of German cut. He had two medals on his breast; his beard\\r\\nwas white, short and thin; his face yellow and wrinkled, with a sly,\\r\\nsuspicious expression in the eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is your father, is it not?â\\x80\\x9d asked the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, it is,â\\x80\\x9d replied Rogojin with an unpleasant smile, as if he had\\r\\nexpected his guest to ask the question, and then to make some\\r\\ndisagreeable remark.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWas he one of the Old Believers?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, he went to church, but to tell the truth he really preferred the\\r\\nold religion. This was his study and is now mine. Why did you ask if he\\r\\nwere an Old Believer?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAre you going to be married here?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYe-yes!â\\x80\\x9d replied Rogojin, starting at the unexpected question.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSoon?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou know yourself it does not depend on me.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cParfen, I am not your enemy, and I do not intend to oppose your\\r\\nintentions in any way. I repeat this to you now just as I said it to\\r\\nyou once before on a very similar occasion. When you were arranging for\\r\\nyour projected marriage in Moscow, I did not interfere with youâ\\x80\\x94you\\r\\nknow I did not. That first time she fled to me from you, from the very\\r\\naltar almost, and begged me to â\\x80\\x98save her from you.â\\x80\\x99 Afterwards she ran\\r\\naway from me again, and you found her and arranged your marriage with\\r\\nher once more; and now, I hear, she has run away from you and come to\\r\\nPetersburg. Is it true? Lebedeff wrote me to this effect, and thatâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nwhy I came here. That you had once more arranged matters with Nastasia\\r\\nPhilipovna I only learned last night in the train from a friend of\\r\\nyours, Zaleshoffâ\\x80\\x94if you wish to know.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI confess I came here with an object. I wished to persuade Nastasia to\\r\\ngo abroad for her health; she requires it. Both mind and body need a\\r\\nchange badly. I did not intend to take her abroad myself. I was going\\r\\nto arrange for her to go without me. Now I tell you honestly, Parfen,\\r\\nif it is true that all is made up between you, I will not so much as\\r\\nset eyes upon her, and I will never even come to see you again.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou know quite well that I am telling the truth, because I have always\\r\\nbeen frank with you. I have never concealed my own opinion from you. I\\r\\nhave always told you that I consider a marriage between you and her\\r\\nwould be ruin to her. You would also be ruined, and perhaps even more\\r\\nhopelessly. If this marriage were to be broken off again, I admit I\\r\\nshould be greatly pleased; but at the same time I have not the\\r\\nslightest intention of trying to part you. You may be quite easy in\\r\\nyour mind, and you need not suspect me. You know yourself whether I was\\r\\never really your rival or not, even when she ran away and came to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere, you are laughing at meâ\\x80\\x94I know why you laugh. It is perfectly\\r\\ntrue that we lived apart from one another all the time, in different\\r\\ntowns. I told you before that I did not love her with love, but with\\r\\npity! You said then that you understood me; did you really understand\\r\\nme or not? What hatred there is in your eyes at this moment! I came to\\r\\nrelieve your mind, because you are dear to me also. I love you very\\r\\nmuch, Parfen; and now I shall go away and never come back again.\\r\\nGoodbye.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince rose.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cStay a little,â\\x80\\x9d said Parfen, not leaving his chair and resting his\\r\\nhead on his right hand. â\\x80\\x9cI havenâ\\x80\\x99t seen you for a long time.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince sat down again. Both were silent for a few moments.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen you are not with me I hate you, Lef Nicolaievitch. I have loathed\\r\\nyou every day of these three months since I last saw you. By heaven I\\r\\nhave!â\\x80\\x9d said Rogojin. â\\x80\\x9cI could have poisoned you at any minute. Now, you\\r\\nhave been with me but a quarter of an hour, and all my malice seems to\\r\\nhave melted away, and you are as dear to me as ever. Stay here a little\\r\\nlonger.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen I am with you you trust me; but as soon as my back is turned you\\r\\nsuspect me,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, smiling, and trying to hide his emotion.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI trust your voice, when I hear you speak. I quite understand that you\\r\\nand I cannot be put on a level, of course.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy did you add that?â\\x80\\x94There! Now you are cross again,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\r\\nprince, wondering.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe were not asked, you see. We were made different, with different\\r\\ntastes and feelings, without being consulted. You say you love her with\\r\\npity. I have no pity for her. She hates meâ\\x80\\x94thatâ\\x80\\x99s the plain truth of\\r\\nthe matter. I dream of her every night, and always that she is laughing\\r\\nat me with another man. And so she does laugh at me. She thinks no more\\r\\nof marrying me than if she were changing her shoe. Would you believe\\r\\nit, I havenâ\\x80\\x99t seen her for five days, and I darenâ\\x80\\x99t go near her. She\\r\\nasks me what I come for, as if she were not content with having\\r\\ndisgraced meâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDisgraced you! How?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cJust as though you didnâ\\x80\\x99t know! Why, she ran away from me, and went to\\r\\nyou. You admitted it yourself, just now.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut surely you do not believe that she...â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat she did not disgrace me at Moscow with that officer,\\r\\nZemtuznikoff? I know for certain she did, after having fixed our\\r\\nmarriage-day herself!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cImpossible!â\\x80\\x9d cried the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know it for a fact,â\\x80\\x9d replied Rogojin, with conviction.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is not like her, you say? My friend, thatâ\\x80\\x99s absurd. Perhaps such an\\r\\nact would horrify her, if she were with you, but it is quite different\\r\\nwhere I am concerned. She looks on me as vermin. Her affair with Keller\\r\\nwas simply to make a laughing-stock of me. You donâ\\x80\\x99t know what a fool\\r\\nshe made of me in Moscow; and the money I spent over her! The money!\\r\\nthe money!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd you can marry her now, Parfen! What will come of it all?â\\x80\\x9d said the\\r\\nprince, with dread in his voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nRogojin gazed back gloomily, and with a terrible expression in his\\r\\neyes, but said nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI havenâ\\x80\\x99t been to see her for five days,â\\x80\\x9d he repeated, after a slight\\r\\npause. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m afraid of being turned out. She says sheâ\\x80\\x99s still her own\\r\\nmistress, and may turn me off altogether, and go abroad. She told me\\r\\nthis herself,â\\x80\\x9d he said, with a peculiar glance at Muishkin. â\\x80\\x9cI think\\r\\nshe often does it merely to frighten me. She is always laughing at me,\\r\\nfor some reason or other; but at other times sheâ\\x80\\x99s angry, and wonâ\\x80\\x99t say\\r\\na word, and thatâ\\x80\\x99s what Iâ\\x80\\x99m afraid of. I took her a shawl one day, the\\r\\nlike of which she might never have seen, although she did live in\\r\\nluxury and she gave it away to her maid, Katia. Sometimes when I can\\r\\nkeep away no longer, I steal past the house on the sly, and once I\\r\\nwatched at the gate till dawnâ\\x80\\x94I thought something was going onâ\\x80\\x94and she\\r\\nsaw me from the window. She asked me what I should do if I found she\\r\\nhad deceived me. I said, â\\x80\\x98You know well enough.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat did she know?â\\x80\\x9d cried the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow was I to tell?â\\x80\\x9d replied Rogojin, with an angry laugh. â\\x80\\x9cI did my\\r\\nbest to catch her tripping in Moscow, but did not succeed. However, I\\r\\ncaught hold of her one day, and said: â\\x80\\x98You are engaged to be married\\r\\ninto a respectable family, and do you know what sort of a woman you\\r\\nare? _Thatâ\\x80\\x99s_ the sort of woman you are,â\\x80\\x99 I said.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou told her that?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, go on.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe said, â\\x80\\x98I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t even have you for a footman now, much less for a\\r\\nhusband.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I shanâ\\x80\\x99t leave the house,â\\x80\\x99 I said, â\\x80\\x98so it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t matter.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Then I shall call somebody and have you kicked out,â\\x80\\x99 she cried. So\\r\\nthen I rushed at her, and beat her till she was bruised all over.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cImpossible!â\\x80\\x9d cried the prince, aghast.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI tell you itâ\\x80\\x99s true,â\\x80\\x9d said Rogojin quietly, but with eyes ablaze with\\r\\npassion.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen for a day and a half I neither slept, nor ate, nor drank, and\\r\\nwould not leave her. I knelt at her feet: â\\x80\\x98I shall die here,â\\x80\\x99 I said,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98if you donâ\\x80\\x99t forgive me; and if you have me turned out, I shall drown\\r\\nmyself; because, what should I be without you now?â\\x80\\x99 She was like a\\r\\nmadwoman all that day; now she would cry; now she would threaten me\\r\\nwith a knife; now she would abuse me. She called in Zaleshoff and\\r\\nKeller, and showed me to them, shamed me in their presence. â\\x80\\x98Letâ\\x80\\x99s all\\r\\ngo to the theatre,â\\x80\\x99 she says, â\\x80\\x98and leave him here if he wonâ\\x80\\x99t goâ\\x80\\x94itâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nnot my business. Theyâ\\x80\\x99ll give you some tea, Parfen Semeonovitch, while\\r\\nI am away, for you must be hungry.â\\x80\\x99 She came back from the theatre\\r\\nalone. â\\x80\\x98Those cowards wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t come,â\\x80\\x99 she said. â\\x80\\x98They are afraid of\\r\\nyou, and tried to frighten me, too. â\\x80\\x9cHe wonâ\\x80\\x99t go away as he came,â\\x80\\x9d they\\r\\nsaid, â\\x80\\x9cheâ\\x80\\x99ll cut your throatâ\\x80\\x94see if he doesnâ\\x80\\x99t.â\\x80\\x9d Now, I shall go to my\\r\\nbedroom, and I shall not even lock my door, just to show you how much I\\r\\nam afraid of you. You must be shown that once for all. Did you have\\r\\ntea?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No,â\\x80\\x99 I said, â\\x80\\x98and I donâ\\x80\\x99t intend to.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Ha, ha! you are playing\\r\\noff your pride against your stomach! That sort of heroism doesnâ\\x80\\x99t sit\\r\\nwell on you,â\\x80\\x99 she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWith that she did as she had said she would; she went to bed, and did\\r\\nnot lock her door. In the morning she came out. â\\x80\\x98Are you quite mad?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nshe said, sharply. â\\x80\\x98Why, youâ\\x80\\x99ll die of hunger like this.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Forgive me,â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nI said. â\\x80\\x98No, I wonâ\\x80\\x99t, and I wonâ\\x80\\x99t marry you. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve said it. Surely you\\r\\nhavenâ\\x80\\x99t sat in this chair all night without sleeping?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I didnâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nsleep,â\\x80\\x99 I said. â\\x80\\x98Hâ\\x80\\x99m! how sensible of you. And are you going to have no\\r\\nbreakfast or dinner today?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I told you I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t. Forgive me!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Youâ\\x80\\x99ve no idea how unbecoming this sort of thing is to you,â\\x80\\x99 she said,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98itâ\\x80\\x99s like putting a saddle on a cowâ\\x80\\x99s back. Do you think you are\\r\\nfrightening me? My word, what a dreadful thing that you should sit here\\r\\nand eat no food! How terribly frightened I am!â\\x80\\x99 She wasnâ\\x80\\x99t angry long,\\r\\nand didnâ\\x80\\x99t seem to remember my offence at all. I was surprised, for she\\r\\nis a vindictive, resentful womanâ\\x80\\x94but then I thought that perhaps she\\r\\ndespised me too much to feel any resentment against me. And thatâ\\x80\\x99s the\\r\\ntruth.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe came up to me and said, â\\x80\\x98Do you know who the Pope of Rome is?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99ve heard of him,â\\x80\\x99 I said. â\\x80\\x98I suppose youâ\\x80\\x99ve read the Universal\\r\\nHistory, Parfen Semeonovitch, havenâ\\x80\\x99t you?â\\x80\\x99 she asked. â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99ve learned\\r\\nnothing at all,â\\x80\\x99 I said. â\\x80\\x98Then Iâ\\x80\\x99ll lend it to you to read. You must\\r\\nknow there was a Roman Pope once, and he was very angry with a certain\\r\\nEmperor; so the Emperor came and neither ate nor drank, but knelt\\r\\nbefore the Popeâ\\x80\\x99s palace till he should be forgiven. And what sort of\\r\\nvows do you think that Emperor was making during all those days on his\\r\\nknees? Stop, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll read it to you!â\\x80\\x99 Then she read me a lot of verses,\\r\\nwhere it said that the Emperor spent all the time vowing vengeance\\r\\nagainst the Pope. â\\x80\\x98You donâ\\x80\\x99t mean to say you donâ\\x80\\x99t approve of the poem,\\r\\nParfen Semeonovitch,â\\x80\\x99 she says. â\\x80\\x98All you have read out is perfectly\\r\\ntrue,â\\x80\\x99 say I. â\\x80\\x98Aha!â\\x80\\x99 says she, â\\x80\\x98you admit itâ\\x80\\x99s true, do you? And you\\r\\nare making vows to yourself that if I marry you, you will remind me of\\r\\nall this, and take it out of me.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I donâ\\x80\\x99t know,â\\x80\\x99 I say, â\\x80\\x98perhaps I was\\r\\nthinking like that, and perhaps I was not. Iâ\\x80\\x99m not thinking of anything\\r\\njust now.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98What are your thoughts, then?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99m thinking that when you\\r\\nrise from your chair and go past me, I watch you, and follow you with\\r\\nmy eyes; if your dress does but rustle, my heart sinks; if you leave\\r\\nthe room, I remember every little word and action, and what your voice\\r\\nsounded like, and what you said. I thought of nothing all last night,\\r\\nbut sat here listening to your sleeping breath, and heard you move a\\r\\nlittle, twice.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98And as for your attack upon me,â\\x80\\x99 she says, â\\x80\\x98I suppose\\r\\nyou never once thought of _that?_â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Perhaps I did think of it, and\\r\\nperhaps not,â\\x80\\x99 I say. â\\x80\\x98And what if I donâ\\x80\\x99t either forgive you or marry,\\r\\nyou?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I tell you I shall go and drown myself.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Hâ\\x80\\x99m!â\\x80\\x99 she said, and\\r\\nthen relapsed into silence. Then she got angry, and went out. â\\x80\\x98I\\r\\nsuppose youâ\\x80\\x99d murder me before you drowned yourself, though!â\\x80\\x99 she cried\\r\\nas she left the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAn hour later, she came to me again, looking melancholy. â\\x80\\x98I will marry\\r\\nyou, Parfen Semeonovitch,â\\x80\\x99 she says, not because Iâ\\x80\\x99m frightened of you,\\r\\nbut because itâ\\x80\\x99s all the same to me how I ruin myself. And how can I do\\r\\nit better? Sit down; theyâ\\x80\\x99ll bring you some dinner directly. And if I\\r\\ndo marry you, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be a faithful wife to youâ\\x80\\x94you need not doubt that.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nThen she thought a bit, and said, â\\x80\\x98At all events, you are not a\\r\\nflunkey; at first, I thought you were no better than a flunkey.â\\x80\\x99 And\\r\\nshe arranged the wedding and fixed the day straight away on the spot.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen, in another week, she had run away again, and came here to\\r\\nLebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s; and when I found her here, she said to me, â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99m not going\\r\\nto renounce you altogether, but I wish to put off the wedding a bit\\r\\nlonger yetâ\\x80\\x94just as long as I likeâ\\x80\\x94for I am still my own mistress; so\\r\\nyou may wait, if you like.â\\x80\\x99 Thatâ\\x80\\x99s how the matter stands between us\\r\\nnow. What do you think of all this, Lef Nicolaievitch?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98What do you think of it yourself?â\\x80\\x9d replied the prince, looking sadly\\r\\nat Rogojin.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAs if I can think anything about it! Iâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d He was about to say more, but\\r\\nstopped in despair.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince rose again, as if he would leave.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAt all events, I shall not interfere with you!â\\x80\\x9d he murmured, as though\\r\\nmaking answer to some secret thought of his own.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you what!â\\x80\\x9d cried Rogojin, and his eyes flashed fire. â\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\ncanâ\\x80\\x99t understand your yielding her to me like this; I donâ\\x80\\x99t understand\\r\\nit. Have you given up loving her altogether? At first you suffered\\r\\nbadlyâ\\x80\\x94I know itâ\\x80\\x94I saw it. Besides, why did you come post-haste after\\r\\nus? Out of pity, eh? He, he, he!â\\x80\\x9d His mouth curved in a mocking smile.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you think I am deceiving you?â\\x80\\x9d asked the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo! I trust youâ\\x80\\x94but I canâ\\x80\\x99t understand. It seems to me that your pity\\r\\nis greater than my love.â\\x80\\x9d A hungry longing to speak his mind out seemed\\r\\nto flash in the manâ\\x80\\x99s eyes, combined with an intense anger.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYour love is mingled with hatred, and therefore, when your love\\r\\npasses, there will be the greater misery,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince. â\\x80\\x9cI tell you\\r\\nthis, Parfenâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat! that Iâ\\x80\\x99ll cut her throat, you mean?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince shuddered.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ll hate her afterwards for all your present love, and for all the\\r\\ntorment you are suffering on her account now. What seems to me the most\\r\\nextraordinary thing is, that she can again consent to marry you, after\\r\\nall that has passed between you. When I heard the news yesterday, I\\r\\ncould hardly bring myself to believe it. Why, she has run twice from\\r\\nyou, from the very altar rails, as it were. She must have some\\r\\npresentiment of evil. What can she want with you now? Your money?\\r\\nNonsense! Besides, I should think you must have made a fairly large\\r\\nhole in your fortune already. Surely it is not because she is so very\\r\\nanxious to find a husband? She could find many a one besides yourself.\\r\\nAnyone would be better than you, because you will murder her, and I\\r\\nfeel sure she must know that but too well by now. Is it because you\\r\\nlove her so passionately? Indeed, that may be it. I have heard that\\r\\nthere are women who want just that kind of love... but still...â\\x80\\x9d The\\r\\nprince paused, reflectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat are you grinning at my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s portrait again for?â\\x80\\x9d asked\\r\\nRogojin, suddenly. He was carefully observing every change in the\\r\\nexpression of the princeâ\\x80\\x99s face.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI smiled because the idea came into my head that if it were not for\\r\\nthis unhappy passion of yours you might have, and would have, become\\r\\njust such a man as your father, and that very quickly, too. Youâ\\x80\\x99d have\\r\\nsettled down in this house of yours with some silent and obedient wife.\\r\\nYou would have spoken rarely, trusted no one, heeded no one, and\\r\\nthought of nothing but making money.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLaugh away! She said exactly the same, almost word for word, when she\\r\\nsaw my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s portrait. Itâ\\x80\\x99s remarkable how entirely you and she are\\r\\nat one now-a-days.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat, has she been here?â\\x80\\x9d asked the prince with curiosity.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes! She looked long at the portrait and asked all about my father.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Youâ\\x80\\x99d be just such another,â\\x80\\x99 she said at last, and laughed. â\\x80\\x98You have\\r\\nsuch strong passions, Parfen,â\\x80\\x99 she said, â\\x80\\x98that theyâ\\x80\\x99d have taken you to\\r\\nSiberia in no time if you had not, luckily, intelligence as well. For\\r\\nyou have a good deal of intelligence.â\\x80\\x99 (She said thisâ\\x80\\x94believe it or\\r\\nnot. The first time I ever heard anything of that sort from her.)\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Youâ\\x80\\x99d soon have thrown up all this rowdyism that you indulge in now,\\r\\nand youâ\\x80\\x99d have settled down to quiet, steady money-making, because you\\r\\nhave little education; and here youâ\\x80\\x99d have stayed just like your father\\r\\nbefore you. And youâ\\x80\\x99d have loved your money so that youâ\\x80\\x99d amass not two\\r\\nmillion, like him, but ten million; and youâ\\x80\\x99d have died of hunger on\\r\\nyour money bags to finish up with, for you carry everything to\\r\\nextremes.â\\x80\\x99 There, thatâ\\x80\\x99s exactly word for word as she said it to me.\\r\\nShe never talked to me like that before. She always talks nonsense and\\r\\nlaughs when sheâ\\x80\\x99s with me. We went all over this old house together. â\\x80\\x98I\\r\\nshall change all this,â\\x80\\x99 I said, â\\x80\\x98or else Iâ\\x80\\x99ll buy a new house for the\\r\\nwedding.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No, no!â\\x80\\x99 she said, â\\x80\\x98donâ\\x80\\x99t touch anything; leave it all as it\\r\\nis; I shall live with your mother when I marry you.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI took her to see my mother, and she was as respectful and kind as\\r\\nthough she were her own daughter. Mother has been almost demented ever\\r\\nsince father diedâ\\x80\\x94sheâ\\x80\\x99s an old woman. She sits and bows from her chair\\r\\nto everyone she sees. If you left her alone and didnâ\\x80\\x99t feed her for\\r\\nthree days, I donâ\\x80\\x99t believe she would notice it. Well, I took her hand,\\r\\nand I said, â\\x80\\x98Give your blessing to this lady, mother, sheâ\\x80\\x99s going to be\\r\\nmy wife.â\\x80\\x99 So Nastasia kissed motherâ\\x80\\x99s hand with great feeling. â\\x80\\x98She\\r\\nmust have suffered terribly, hasnâ\\x80\\x99t she?â\\x80\\x99 she said. She saw this book\\r\\nhere lying before me. â\\x80\\x98What! have you begun to read Russian history?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nshe asked. She told me once in Moscow, you know, that I had better get\\r\\nSolovieffâ\\x80\\x99s Russian History and read it, because I knew nothing.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Thatâ\\x80\\x99s good,â\\x80\\x99 she said, â\\x80\\x98you go on like that, reading books. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll make\\r\\nyou a list myself of the books you ought to read firstâ\\x80\\x94shall I?â\\x80\\x99 She\\r\\nhad never once spoken to me like this before; it was the first time I\\r\\nfelt I could breathe before her like a living creature.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m very, very glad to hear of this, Parfen,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, with\\r\\nreal feeling. â\\x80\\x9cWho knows? Maybe God will yet bring you near to one\\r\\nanother.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNever, never!â\\x80\\x9d cried Rogojin, excitedly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLook here, Parfen; if you love her so much, surely you must be anxious\\r\\nto earn her respect? And if you do so wish, surely you may hope to? I\\r\\nsaid just now that I considered it extraordinary that she could still\\r\\nbe ready to marry you. Well, though I cannot yet understand it, I feel\\r\\nsure she must have some good reason, or she wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t do it. She is sure\\r\\nof your love; but besides that, she must attribute _something_ else to\\r\\nyouâ\\x80\\x94some good qualities, otherwise the thing would not be. What you\\r\\nhave just said confirms my words. You say yourself that she found it\\r\\npossible to speak to you quite differently from her usual manner. You\\r\\nare suspicious, you know, and jealous, therefore when anything annoying\\r\\nhappens to you, you exaggerate its significance. Of course, of course,\\r\\nshe does not think so ill of you as you say. Why, if she did, she would\\r\\nsimply be walking to death by drowning or by the knife, with her eyes\\r\\nwide open, when she married you. It is impossible! As if anybody would\\r\\ngo to their death deliberately!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRogojin listened to the princeâ\\x80\\x99s excited words with a bitter smile. His\\r\\nconviction was, apparently, unalterable.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow dreadfully you look at me, Parfen!â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, with a\\r\\nfeeling of dread.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWater or the knife?â\\x80\\x9d said the latter, at last. â\\x80\\x9cHa, haâ\\x80\\x94thatâ\\x80\\x99s exactly\\r\\nwhy she is going to marry me, because she knows for certain that the\\r\\nknife awaits her. Prince, can it be that you donâ\\x80\\x99t even yet see whatâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nat the root of it all?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t understand you.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPerhaps he really doesnâ\\x80\\x99t understand me! They do say that you are\\r\\naâ\\x80\\x94you know what! She loves anotherâ\\x80\\x94there, you can understand that much!\\r\\nJust as I love her, exactly so she loves another man. And that other\\r\\nman isâ\\x80\\x94do you know who? Itâ\\x80\\x99s you. Thereâ\\x80\\x94you didnâ\\x80\\x99t know that, eh?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou, you! She has loved you ever since that day, her birthday! Only\\r\\nshe thinks she cannot marry you, because it would be the ruin of you.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Everybody knows what sort of a woman I am,â\\x80\\x99 she says. She told me all\\r\\nthis herself, to my very face! Sheâ\\x80\\x99s afraid of disgracing and ruining\\r\\nyou, she says, but it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t matter about me. She can marry me all\\r\\nright! Notice how much consideration she shows for me!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut why did she run away to me, and then again from me toâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFrom you to me? Ha, ha! thatâ\\x80\\x99s nothing! Why, she always acts as though\\r\\nshe were in a delirium now-a-days! Either she says, â\\x80\\x98Come on, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\nmarry you! Letâ\\x80\\x99s have the wedding quickly!â\\x80\\x99 and fixes the day, and\\r\\nseems in a hurry for it, and when it begins to come near she feels\\r\\nfrightened; or else some other idea gets into her headâ\\x80\\x94goodness knows!\\r\\nyouâ\\x80\\x99ve seen herâ\\x80\\x94you know how she goes onâ\\x80\\x94laughing and crying and\\r\\nraving! Thereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing extraordinary about her having run away from\\r\\nyou! She ran away because she found out how dearly she loved you. She\\r\\ncould not bear to be near you. You said just now that I had found her\\r\\nat Moscow, when she ran away from you. I didnâ\\x80\\x99t do anything of the\\r\\nsort; she came to me herself, straight from you. â\\x80\\x98Name the dayâ\\x80\\x94Iâ\\x80\\x99m\\r\\nready!â\\x80\\x99 she said. â\\x80\\x98Letâ\\x80\\x99s have some champagne, and go and hear the\\r\\ngipsies sing!â\\x80\\x99 I tell you sheâ\\x80\\x99d have thrown herself into the water long\\r\\nago if it were not for me! She doesnâ\\x80\\x99t do it because I am, perhaps,\\r\\neven more dreadful to her than the water! Sheâ\\x80\\x99s marrying me out of\\r\\nspite; if she marries me, I tell you, it will be for spite!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut how do you, how can youâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d began the prince, gazing with dread and\\r\\nhorror at Rogojin.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy donâ\\x80\\x99t you finish your sentence? Shall I tell you what you were\\r\\nthinking to yourself just then? You were thinking, â\\x80\\x98How can she marry\\r\\nhim after this? How can it possibly be permitted?â\\x80\\x99 Oh, I know what you\\r\\nwere thinking about!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI didnâ\\x80\\x99t come here for that purpose, Parfen. That was not in my mindâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat may be! Perhaps you didnâ\\x80\\x99t _come_ with the idea, but the idea is\\r\\ncertainly there _now!_ Ha, ha! well, thatâ\\x80\\x99s enough! What are you upset\\r\\nabout? Didnâ\\x80\\x99t you really know it all before? You astonish me!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAll this is mere jealousyâ\\x80\\x94it is some malady of yours, Parfen! You\\r\\nexaggerate everything,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, excessively agitated. â\\x80\\x9cWhat\\r\\nare you doing?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLet go of it!â\\x80\\x9d said Parfen, seizing from the princeâ\\x80\\x99s hand a knife\\r\\nwhich the latter had at that moment taken up from the table, where it\\r\\nlay beside the history. Parfen replaced it where it had been.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI seemed to know itâ\\x80\\x94I felt it, when I was coming back to Petersburg,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\ncontinued the prince, â\\x80\\x9cI did not want to come, I wished to forget all\\r\\nthis, to uproot it from my memory altogether! Well, good-byeâ\\x80\\x94what is\\r\\nthe matter?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had absently taken up the knife a second time, and again Rogojin\\r\\nsnatched it from his hand, and threw it down on the table. It was a\\r\\nplain looking knife, with a bone handle, a blade about eight inches\\r\\nlong, and broad in proportion, it did not clasp.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeeing that the prince was considerably struck by the fact that he had\\r\\ntwice seized this knife out of his hand, Rogojin caught it up with some\\r\\nirritation, put it inside the book, and threw the latter across to\\r\\nanother table.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you cut your pages with it, or what?â\\x80\\x9d asked Muishkin, still rather\\r\\nabsently, as though unable to throw off a deep preoccupation into which\\r\\nthe conversation had thrown him.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a garden knife, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes. Canâ\\x80\\x99t one cut pages with a garden knife?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s quite new.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, what of that? Canâ\\x80\\x99t I buy a new knife if I like?â\\x80\\x9d shouted\\r\\nRogojin furiously, his irritation growing with every word.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince shuddered, and gazed fixedly at Parfen. Suddenly he burst\\r\\nout laughing.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, what an idea!â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cI didnâ\\x80\\x99t mean to ask you any of these\\r\\nquestions; I was thinking of something quite different! But my head is\\r\\nheavy, and I seem so absent-minded nowadays! Well, good-byeâ\\x80\\x94I canâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nremember what I wanted to sayâ\\x80\\x94good-bye!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot that way,â\\x80\\x9d said Rogojin.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve forgotten that too!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis wayâ\\x80\\x94come alongâ\\x80\\x94Iâ\\x80\\x99ll show you.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIV.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey passed through the same rooms which the prince had traversed on\\r\\nhis arrival. In the largest there were pictures on the walls, portraits\\r\\nand landscapes of little interest. Over the door, however, there was\\r\\none of strange and rather striking shape; it was six or seven feet in\\r\\nlength, and not more than a foot in height. It represented the Saviour\\r\\njust taken from the cross.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince glanced at it, but took no further notice. He moved on\\r\\nhastily, as though anxious to get out of the house. But Rogojin\\r\\nsuddenly stopped underneath the picture.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy father picked up all these pictures very cheap at auctions, and so\\r\\non,â\\x80\\x9d he said; â\\x80\\x9cthey are all rubbish, except the one over the door, and\\r\\nthat is valuable. A man offered five hundred roubles for it last week.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYesâ\\x80\\x94thatâ\\x80\\x99s a copy of a Holbein,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, looking at it again,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand a good copy, too, so far as I am able to judge. I saw the picture\\r\\nabroad, and could not forget itâ\\x80\\x94whatâ\\x80\\x99s the matter?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRogojin had dropped the subject of the picture and walked on. Of course\\r\\nhis strange frame of mind was sufficient to account for his conduct;\\r\\nbut, still, it seemed queer to the prince that he should so abruptly\\r\\ndrop a conversation commenced by himself. Rogojin did not take any\\r\\nnotice of his question.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLef Nicolaievitch,â\\x80\\x9d said Rogojin, after a pause, during which the two\\r\\nwalked along a little further, â\\x80\\x9cI have long wished to ask you, do you\\r\\nbelieve in God?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow strangely you speak, and how odd you look!â\\x80\\x9d said the other,\\r\\ninvoluntarily.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI like looking at that picture,â\\x80\\x9d muttered Rogojin, not noticing,\\r\\napparently, that the prince had not answered his question.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat picture! That picture!â\\x80\\x9d cried Muishkin, struck by a sudden idea.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, a manâ\\x80\\x99s faith might be ruined by looking at that picture!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo it is!â\\x80\\x9d said Rogojin, unexpectedly. They had now reached the front\\r\\ndoor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince stopped.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow?â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean? I was half joking, and you took me\\r\\nup quite seriously! Why do you ask me whether I believe in God?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, no particular reason. I meant to ask you beforeâ\\x80\\x94many people are\\r\\nunbelievers nowadays, especially Russians, I have been told. You ought\\r\\nto knowâ\\x80\\x94youâ\\x80\\x99ve lived abroad.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRogojin laughed bitterly as he said these words, and opening the door,\\r\\nheld it for the prince to pass out. Muishkin looked surprised, but went\\r\\nout. The other followed him as far as the landing of the outer stairs,\\r\\nand shut the door behind him. They both now stood facing one another,\\r\\nas though oblivious of where they were, or what they had to do next.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, good-bye!â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, holding out his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood-bye,â\\x80\\x9d said Rogojin, pressing it hard, but quite mechanically.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince made one step forward, and then turned round.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAs to faith,â\\x80\\x9d he said, smiling, and evidently unwilling to leave\\r\\nRogojin in this stateâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cas to faith, I had four curious conversations in\\r\\ntwo days, a week or so ago. One morning I met a man in the train, and\\r\\nmade acquaintance with him at once. I had often heard of him as a very\\r\\nlearned man, but an atheist; and I was very glad of the opportunity of\\r\\nconversing with so eminent and clever a person. He doesnâ\\x80\\x99t believe in\\r\\nGod, and he talked a good deal about it, but all the while it appeared\\r\\nto me that he was speaking _outside the subject_. And it has always\\r\\nstruck me, both in speaking to such men and in reading their books,\\r\\nthat they do not seem really to be touching on that at all, though on\\r\\nthe surface they may appear to do so. I told him this, but I dare say I\\r\\ndid not clearly express what I meant, for he could not understand me.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat same evening I stopped at a small provincial hotel, and it so\\r\\nhappened that a dreadful murder had been committed there the night\\r\\nbefore, and everybody was talking about it. Two peasantsâ\\x80\\x94elderly men\\r\\nand old friendsâ\\x80\\x94had had tea together there the night before, and were\\r\\nto occupy the same bedroom. They were not drunk but one of them had\\r\\nnoticed for the first time that his friend possessed a silver watch\\r\\nwhich he was wearing on a chain. He was by no means a thief, and was,\\r\\nas peasants go, a rich man; but this watch so fascinated him that he\\r\\ncould not restrain himself. He took a knife, and when his friend turned\\r\\nhis back, he came up softly behind, raised his eyes to heaven, crossed\\r\\nhimself, and saying earnestlyâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98God forgive me, for Christâ\\x80\\x99s sake!â\\x80\\x99 he\\r\\ncut his friendâ\\x80\\x99s throat like a sheep, and took the watch.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRogojin roared with laughter. He laughed as though he were in a sort of\\r\\nfit. It was strange to see him laughing so after the sombre mood he had\\r\\nbeen in just before.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, I like that! That beats anything!â\\x80\\x9d he cried convulsively, panting\\r\\nfor breath. â\\x80\\x9cOne is an absolute unbeliever; the other is such a\\r\\nthorough-going believer that he murders his friend to the tune of a\\r\\nprayer! Oh, prince, prince, thatâ\\x80\\x99s too good for anything! You canâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nhave invented it. Itâ\\x80\\x99s the best thing Iâ\\x80\\x99ve heard!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNext morning I went out for a stroll through the town,â\\x80\\x9d continued the\\r\\nprince, so soon as Rogojin was a little quieter, though his laughter\\r\\nstill burst out at intervals, â\\x80\\x9cand soon observed a drunken-looking\\r\\nsoldier staggering about the pavement. He came up to me and said, â\\x80\\x98Buy\\r\\nmy silver cross, sir! You shall have it for fourpenceâ\\x80\\x94itâ\\x80\\x99s real\\r\\nsilver.â\\x80\\x99 I looked, and there he held a cross, just taken off his own\\r\\nneck, evidently, a large tin one, made after the Byzantine pattern. I\\r\\nfished out fourpence, and put his cross on my own neck, and I could see\\r\\nby his face that he was as pleased as he could be at the thought that\\r\\nhe had succeeded in cheating a foolish gentleman, and away he went to\\r\\ndrink the value of his cross. At that time everything that I saw made a\\r\\ntremendous impression upon me. I had understood nothing about Russia\\r\\nbefore, and had only vague and fantastic memories of it. So I thought,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98I will wait awhile before I condemn this Judas. Only God knows what\\r\\nmay be hidden in the hearts of drunkards.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, I went homewards, and near the hotel I came across a poor woman,\\r\\ncarrying a childâ\\x80\\x94a baby of some six weeks old. The mother was quite a\\r\\ngirl herself. The baby was smiling up at her, for the first time in its\\r\\nlife, just at that moment; and while I watched the woman she suddenly\\r\\ncrossed herself, oh, so devoutly! â\\x80\\x98What is it, my good woman?â\\x80\\x99 I asked\\r\\nher. (I was never but asking questions then!) â\\x80\\x98Exactly as is a motherâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\njoy when her baby smiles for the first time into her eyes, so is Godâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\njoy when one of His children turns and prays to Him for the first time,\\r\\nwith all his heart!â\\x80\\x99 This is what that poor woman said to me, almost\\r\\nword for word; and such a deep, refined, truly religious thought it\\r\\nwasâ\\x80\\x94a thought in which the whole essence of Christianity was expressed\\r\\nin one flashâ\\x80\\x94that is, the recognition of God as our Father, and of\\r\\nGodâ\\x80\\x99s joy in men as His own children, which is the chief idea of\\r\\nChrist. She was a simple country-womanâ\\x80\\x94a mother, itâ\\x80\\x99s trueâ\\x80\\x94and perhaps,\\r\\nwho knows, she may have been the wife of the drunken soldier!\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cListen, Parfen; you put a question to me just now. This is my reply.\\r\\nThe essence of religious feeling has nothing to do with reason, or\\r\\natheism, or crime, or acts of any kindâ\\x80\\x94it has nothing to do with these\\r\\nthingsâ\\x80\\x94and never had. There is something besides all this, something\\r\\nwhich the arguments of the atheists can never touch. But the principal\\r\\nthing, and the conclusion of my argument, is that this is most clearly\\r\\nseen in the heart of a Russian. This is a conviction which I have\\r\\ngained while I have been in this Russia of ours. Yes, Parfen! there is\\r\\nwork to be done; there is work to be done in this Russian world!\\r\\nRemember what talks we used to have in Moscow! And I never wished to\\r\\ncome here at all; and I never thought to meet you like this, Parfen!\\r\\nWell, wellâ\\x80\\x94good-byeâ\\x80\\x94good-bye! God be with you!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned and went downstairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLef Nicolaievitch!â\\x80\\x9d cried Parfen, before he had reached the next\\r\\nlanding. â\\x80\\x9cHave you got that cross you bought from the soldier with\\r\\nyou?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I have,â\\x80\\x9d and the prince stopped again.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShow it me, will you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA new fancy! The prince reflected, and then mounted the stairs once\\r\\nmore. He pulled out the cross without taking it off his neck.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGive it to me,â\\x80\\x9d said Parfen.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy? do youâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince would rather have kept this particular cross.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll wear it; and you shall have mine. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll take it off at once.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou wish to exchange crosses? Very well, Parfen, if thatâ\\x80\\x99s the case,\\r\\nIâ\\x80\\x99m glad enoughâ\\x80\\x94that makes us brothers, you know.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince took off his tin cross, Parfen his gold one, and the\\r\\nexchange was made.\\r\\n\\r\\nParfen was silent. With sad surprise the prince observed that the look\\r\\nof distrust, the bitter, ironical smile, had still not altogether left\\r\\nhis newly-adopted brotherâ\\x80\\x99s face. At moments, at all events, it showed\\r\\nitself but too plainly,\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last Rogojin took the princeâ\\x80\\x99s hand, and stood so for some moments,\\r\\nas though he could not make up his mind. Then he drew him along,\\r\\nmurmuring almost inaudibly,\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey stopped on the landing, and rang the bell at a door opposite to\\r\\nParfenâ\\x80\\x99s own lodging.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn old woman opened to them and bowed low to Parfen, who asked her some\\r\\nquestions hurriedly, but did not wait to hear her answer. He led the\\r\\nprince on through several dark, cold-looking rooms, spotlessly clean,\\r\\nwith white covers over all the furniture.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout the ceremony of knocking, Parfen entered a small apartment,\\r\\nfurnished like a drawing-room, but with a polished mahogany partition\\r\\ndividing one half of it from what was probably a bedroom. In one corner\\r\\nof this room sat an old woman in an arm-chair, close to the stove. She\\r\\ndid not look very old, and her face was a pleasant, round one; but she\\r\\nwas white-haired and, as one could detect at the first glance, quite in\\r\\nher second childhood. She wore a black woollen dress, with a black\\r\\nhandkerchief round her neck and shoulders, and a white cap with black\\r\\nribbons. Her feet were raised on a footstool. Beside her sat another\\r\\nold woman, also dressed in mourning, and silently knitting a stocking;\\r\\nthis was evidently a companion. They both looked as though they never\\r\\nbroke the silence. The first old woman, so soon as she saw Rogojin and\\r\\nthe prince, smiled and bowed courteously several times, in token of her\\r\\ngratification at their visit.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMother,â\\x80\\x9d said Rogojin, kissing her hand, â\\x80\\x9chere is my great friend,\\r\\nPrince Muishkin; we have exchanged crosses; he was like a real brother\\r\\nto me at Moscow at one time, and did a great deal for me. Bless him,\\r\\nmother, as you would bless your own son. Wait a moment, let me arrange\\r\\nyour hands for you.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the old lady, before Parfen had time to touch her, raised her right\\r\\nhand, and, with three fingers held up, devoutly made the sign of the\\r\\ncross three times over the prince. She then nodded her head kindly at\\r\\nhim once more.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere, come along, Lef Nicolaievitch; thatâ\\x80\\x99s all I brought you here\\r\\nfor,â\\x80\\x9d said Rogojin.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they reached the stairs again he added:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe understood nothing of what I said to her, and did not know what I\\r\\nwanted her to do, and yet she blessed you; that shows she wished to do\\r\\nso herself. Well, goodbye; itâ\\x80\\x99s time you went, and I must go too.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe opened his own door.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, let me at least embrace you and say goodbye, you strange\\r\\nfellow!â\\x80\\x9d cried the prince, looking with gentle reproach at Rogojin, and\\r\\nadvancing towards him. But the latter had hardly raised his arms when\\r\\nhe dropped them again. He could not make up his mind to it; he turned\\r\\naway from the prince in order to avoid looking at him. He could not\\r\\nembrace him.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t be afraid,â\\x80\\x9d he muttered, indistinctly, â\\x80\\x9cthough I have taken your\\r\\ncross, I shall not murder you for your watch.â\\x80\\x9d So saying, he laughed\\r\\nsuddenly, and strangely. Then in a moment his face became transfigured;\\r\\nhe grew deadly white, his lips trembled, his eyes burned like fire. He\\r\\nstretched out his arms and held the prince tightly to him, and said in\\r\\na strangled voice:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, take her! Itâ\\x80\\x99s Fate! Sheâ\\x80\\x99s yours. I surrender her.... Remember\\r\\nRogojin!â\\x80\\x9d And pushing the prince from him, without looking back at him,\\r\\nhe hurriedly entered his own flat, and banged the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nV.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was late now, nearly half-past two, and the prince did not find\\r\\nGeneral Epanchin at home. He left a card, and determined to look up\\r\\nColia, who had a room at a small hotel near. Colia was not in, but he\\r\\nwas informed that he might be back shortly, and had left word that if\\r\\nhe were not in by half-past three it was to be understood that he had\\r\\ngone to Pavlofsk to General Epanchinâ\\x80\\x99s, and would dine there. The\\r\\nprince decided to wait till half-past three, and ordered some dinner.\\r\\nAt half-past three there was no sign of Colia. The prince waited until\\r\\nfour oâ\\x80\\x99clock, and then strolled off mechanically wherever his feet\\r\\nshould carry him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early summer there are often magnificent days in St.\\r\\nPetersburgâ\\x80\\x94bright, hot and still. This happened to be such a day.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some time the prince wandered about without aim or object. He did\\r\\nnot know the town well. He stopped to look about him on bridges, at\\r\\nstreet corners. He entered a confectionerâ\\x80\\x99s shop to rest, once. He was\\r\\nin a state of nervous excitement and perturbation; he noticed nothing\\r\\nand no one; and he felt a craving for solitude, to be alone with his\\r\\nthoughts and his emotions, and to give himself up to them passively. He\\r\\nloathed the idea of trying to answer the questions that would rise up\\r\\nin his heart and mind. â\\x80\\x9cI am not to blame for all this,â\\x80\\x9d he thought to\\r\\nhimself, half unconsciously.\\r\\n\\r\\nTowards six oâ\\x80\\x99clock he found himself at the station of the\\r\\nTsarsko-Selski railway.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was tired of solitude now; a new rush of feeling took hold of him,\\r\\nand a flood of light chased away the gloom, for a moment, from his\\r\\nsoul. He took a ticket to Pavlofsk, and determined to get there as fast\\r\\nas he could, but something stopped him; a reality, and not a fantasy,\\r\\nas he was inclined to think it. He was about to take his place in a\\r\\ncarriage, when he suddenly threw away his ticket and came out again,\\r\\ndisturbed and thoughtful. A few moments later, in the street, he\\r\\nrecalled something that had bothered him all the afternoon. He caught\\r\\nhimself engaged in a strange occupation which he now recollected he had\\r\\ntaken up at odd moments for the last few hoursâ\\x80\\x94it was looking about all\\r\\naround him for something, he did not know what. He had forgotten it for\\r\\na while, half an hour or so, and now, suddenly, the uneasy search had\\r\\nrecommenced.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he had hardly become conscious of this curious phenomenon, when\\r\\nanother recollection suddenly swam through his brain, interesting him\\r\\nfor the moment, exceedingly. He remembered that the last time he had\\r\\nbeen engaged in looking around him for the unknown something, he was\\r\\nstanding before a cutlerâ\\x80\\x99s shop, in the window of which were exposed\\r\\ncertain goods for sale. He was extremely anxious now to discover\\r\\nwhether this shop and these goods really existed, or whether the whole\\r\\nthing had been a hallucination.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe felt in a very curious condition today, a condition similar to that\\r\\nwhich had preceded his fits in bygone years.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe remembered that at such times he had been particularly absentminded,\\r\\nand could not discriminate between objects and persons unless he\\r\\nconcentrated special attention upon them.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe remembered seeing something in the window marked at sixty copecks.\\r\\nTherefore, if the shop existed and if this object were really in the\\r\\nwindow, it would prove that he had been able to concentrate his\\r\\nattention on this article at a moment when, as a general rule, his\\r\\nabsence of mind would have been too great to admit of any such\\r\\nconcentration; in fact, very shortly after he had left the railway\\r\\nstation in such a state of agitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he walked back looking about him for the shop, and his heart beat\\r\\nwith intolerable impatience. Ah! here was the very shop, and there was\\r\\nthe article marked â\\x80\\x9c60 cop.â\\x80\\x9d Of course, itâ\\x80\\x99s sixty copecks, he thought,\\r\\nand certainly worth no more. This idea amused him and he laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it was a hysterical laugh; he was feeling terribly oppressed. He\\r\\nremembered clearly that just here, standing before this window, he had\\r\\nsuddenly turned round, just as earlier in the day he had turned and\\r\\nfound the dreadful eyes of Rogojin fixed upon him. Convinced,\\r\\ntherefore, that in this respect at all events he had been under no\\r\\ndelusion, he left the shop and went on.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis must be thought out; it was clear that there had been no\\r\\nhallucination at the station then, either; something had actually\\r\\nhappened to him, on both occasions; there was no doubt of it. But again\\r\\na loathing for all mental exertion overmastered him; he would not think\\r\\nit out now, he would put it off and think of something else. He\\r\\nremembered that during his epileptic fits, or rather immediately\\r\\npreceding them, he had always experienced a moment or two when his\\r\\nwhole heart, and mind, and body seemed to wake up to vigour and light;\\r\\nwhen he became filled with joy and hope, and all his anxieties seemed\\r\\nto be swept away for ever; these moments were but presentiments, as it\\r\\nwere, of the one final second (it was never more than a second) in\\r\\nwhich the fit came upon him. That second, of course, was inexpressible.\\r\\nWhen his attack was over, and the prince reflected on his symptoms, he\\r\\nused to say to himself: â\\x80\\x9cThese moments, short as they are, when I feel\\r\\nsuch extreme consciousness of myself, and consequently more of life\\r\\nthan at other times, are due only to the diseaseâ\\x80\\x94to the sudden rupture\\r\\nof normal conditions. Therefore they are not really a higher kind of\\r\\nlife, but a lower.â\\x80\\x9d This reasoning, however, seemed to end in a\\r\\nparadox, and lead to the further consideration:â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cWhat matter though it\\r\\nbe only disease, an abnormal tension of the brain, if when I recall and\\r\\nanalyze the moment, it seems to have been one of harmony and beauty in\\r\\nthe highest degreeâ\\x80\\x94an instant of deepest sensation, overflowing with\\r\\nunbounded joy and rapture, ecstatic devotion, and completest life?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nVague though this sounds, it was perfectly comprehensible to Muishkin,\\r\\nthough he knew that it was but a feeble expression of his sensations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat there was, indeed, beauty and harmony in those abnormal moments,\\r\\nthat they really contained the highest synthesis of life, he could not\\r\\ndoubt, nor even admit the possibility of doubt. He felt that they were\\r\\nnot analogous to the fantastic and unreal dreams due to intoxication by\\r\\nhashish, opium or wine. Of that he could judge, when the attack was\\r\\nover. These instants were characterizedâ\\x80\\x94to define it in a wordâ\\x80\\x94by an\\r\\nintense quickening of the sense of personality. Since, in the last\\r\\nconscious moment preceding the attack, he could say to himself, with\\r\\nfull understanding of his words: â\\x80\\x9cI would give my whole life for this\\r\\none instant,â\\x80\\x9d then doubtless to him it really was worth a lifetime. For\\r\\nthe rest, he thought the dialectical part of his argument of little\\r\\nworth; he saw only too clearly that the result of these ecstatic\\r\\nmoments was stupefaction, mental darkness, idiocy. No argument was\\r\\npossible on that point. His conclusion, his estimate of the â\\x80\\x9cmoment,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\ndoubtless contained some error, yet the reality of the sensation\\r\\ntroubled him. Whatâ\\x80\\x99s more unanswerable than a fact? And this fact had\\r\\noccurred. The prince had confessed unreservedly to himself that the\\r\\nfeeling of intense beatitude in that crowded moment made the moment\\r\\nworth a lifetime. â\\x80\\x9cI feel then,â\\x80\\x9d he said one day to Rogojin in Moscow,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI feel then as if I understood those amazing wordsâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98There shall be no\\r\\nmore time.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d And he added with a smile: â\\x80\\x9cNo doubt the epileptic Mahomet\\r\\nrefers to that same moment when he says that he visited all the\\r\\ndwellings of Allah, in less time than was needed to empty his pitcher\\r\\nof water.â\\x80\\x9d Yes, he had often met Rogojin in Moscow, and many were the\\r\\nsubjects they discussed. â\\x80\\x9cHe told me I had been a brother to him,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nthought the prince. â\\x80\\x9cHe said so today, for the first time.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was sitting in the Summer Garden on a seat under a tree, and his\\r\\nmind dwelt on the matter. It was about seven oâ\\x80\\x99clock, and the place was\\r\\nempty. The stifling atmosphere foretold a storm, and the prince felt a\\r\\ncertain charm in the contemplative mood which possessed him. He found\\r\\npleasure, too, in gazing at the exterior objects around him. All the\\r\\ntime he was trying to forget some thing, to escape from some idea that\\r\\nhaunted him; but melancholy thoughts came back, though he would so\\r\\nwillingly have escaped from them. He remembered suddenly how he had\\r\\nbeen talking to the waiter, while he dined, about a recently committed\\r\\nmurder which the whole town was discussing, and as he thought of it\\r\\nsomething strange came over him. He was seized all at once by a violent\\r\\ndesire, almost a temptation, against which he strove in vain.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe jumped up and walked off as fast as he could towards the â\\x80\\x9cPetersburg\\r\\nSide.â\\x80\\x9d [One of the quarters of St. Petersburg.] He had asked someone, a\\r\\nlittle while before, to show him which was the Petersburg Side, on the\\r\\nbanks of the Neva. He had not gone there, however; and he knew very\\r\\nwell that it was of no use to go now, for he would certainly not find\\r\\nLebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s relation at home. He had the address, but she must certainly\\r\\nhave gone to Pavlofsk, or Colia would have let him know. If he were to\\r\\ngo now, it would merely be out of curiosity, but a sudden, new idea had\\r\\ncome into his head.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, it was something to move on and know where he was going. A\\r\\nminute later he was still moving on, but without knowing anything. He\\r\\ncould no longer think out his new idea. He tried to take an interest in\\r\\nall he saw; in the sky, in the Neva. He spoke to some children he met.\\r\\nHe felt his epileptic condition becoming more and more developed. The\\r\\nevening was very close; thunder was heard some way off.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince was haunted all that day by the face of Lebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s nephew\\r\\nwhom he had seen for the first time that morning, just as one is\\r\\nhaunted at times by some persistent musical refrain. By a curious\\r\\nassociation of ideas, the young man always appeared as the murderer of\\r\\nwhom Lebedeff had spoken when introducing him to Muishkin. Yes, he had\\r\\nread something about the murder, and that quite recently. Since he came\\r\\nto Russia, he had heard many stories of this kind, and was interested\\r\\nin them. His conversation with the waiter, an hour ago, chanced to be\\r\\non the subject of this murder of the Zemarins, and the latter had\\r\\nagreed with him about it. He thought of the waiter again, and decided\\r\\nthat he was no fool, but a steady, intelligent man: though, said he to\\r\\nhimself, â\\x80\\x9cGod knows what he may really be; in a country with which one\\r\\nis unfamiliar it is difficult to understand the people one meets.â\\x80\\x9d He\\r\\nwas beginning to have a passionate faith in the Russian soul, however,\\r\\nand what discoveries he had made in the last six months, what\\r\\nunexpected discoveries! But every soul is a mystery, and depths of\\r\\nmystery lie in the soul of a Russian. He had been intimate with\\r\\nRogojin, for example, and a brotherly friendship had sprung up between\\r\\nthemâ\\x80\\x94yet did he really know him? What chaos and ugliness fills the\\r\\nworld at times! What a self-satisfied rascal is that nephew of\\r\\nLebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s! â\\x80\\x9cBut what am I thinking,â\\x80\\x9d continued the prince to himself.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCan he really have committed that crime? Did he kill those six\\r\\npersons? I seem to be confusing things... how strange it all is.... My\\r\\nhead goes round... And Lebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s daughterâ\\x80\\x94how sympathetic and charming\\r\\nher face was as she held the child in her arms! What an innocent look\\r\\nand child-like laugh she had! It is curious that I had forgotten her\\r\\nuntil now. I expect Lebedeff adores herâ\\x80\\x94and I really believe, when I\\r\\nthink of it, that as sure as two and two make four, he is fond of that\\r\\nnephew, too!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, why should he judge them so hastily! Could he really say what\\r\\nthey were, after one short visit? Even Lebedeff seemed an enigma today.\\r\\nDid he expect to find him so? He had never seen him like that before.\\r\\nLebedeff and the Comtesse du Barry! Good Heavens! If Rogojin should\\r\\nreally kill someone, it would not, at any rate, be such a senseless,\\r\\nchaotic affair. A knife made to a special pattern, and six people\\r\\nkilled in a kind of delirium. But Rogojin also had a knife made to a\\r\\nspecial pattern. Can it be that Rogojin wishes to murder anyone? The\\r\\nprince began to tremble violently. â\\x80\\x9cIt is a crime on my part to imagine\\r\\nanything so base, with such cynical frankness.â\\x80\\x9d His face reddened with\\r\\nshame at the thought; and then there came across him as in a flash the\\r\\nmemory of the incidents at the Pavlofsk station, and at the other\\r\\nstation in the morning; and the question asked him by Rogojin about\\r\\n_the eyes_ and Rogojinâ\\x80\\x99s cross, that he was even now wearing; and the\\r\\nbenediction of Rogojinâ\\x80\\x99s mother; and his embrace on the darkened\\r\\nstaircaseâ\\x80\\x94that last supreme renunciationâ\\x80\\x94and now, to find himself full\\r\\nof this new â\\x80\\x9cidea,â\\x80\\x9d staring into shop-windows, and looking round for\\r\\nthingsâ\\x80\\x94how base he was!\\r\\n\\r\\nDespair overmastered his soul; he would not go on, he would go back to\\r\\nhis hotel; he even turned and went the other way; but a moment after he\\r\\nchanged his mind again and went on in the old direction.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy, here he was on the Petersburg Side already, quite close to the\\r\\nhouse! Where was his â\\x80\\x9cideaâ\\x80\\x9d? He was marching along without it now. Yes,\\r\\nhis malady was coming back, it was clear enough; all this gloom and\\r\\nheaviness, all these â\\x80\\x9cideas,â\\x80\\x9d were nothing more nor less than a fit\\r\\ncoming on; perhaps he would have a fit this very day.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut just now all the gloom and darkness had fled, his heart felt full\\r\\nof joy and hope, there was no such thing as doubt. And yes, he hadnâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nseen her for so long; he really must see her. He wished he could meet\\r\\nRogojin; he would take his hand, and they would go to her together. His\\r\\nheart was pure, he was no rival of Parfenâ\\x80\\x99s. Tomorrow, he would go and\\r\\ntell him that he had seen her. Why, he had only come for the sole\\r\\npurpose of seeing her, all the way from Moscow! Perhaps she might be\\r\\nhere still, who knows? She might not have gone away to Pavlofsk yet.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, all this must be put straight and above-board, there must be no\\r\\nmore passionate renouncements, such as Rogojinâ\\x80\\x99s. It must all be clear\\r\\nas day. Cannot Rogojinâ\\x80\\x99s soul bear the light? He said he did not love\\r\\nher with sympathy and pity; true, he added that â\\x80\\x9cyour pity is greater\\r\\nthan my love,â\\x80\\x9d but he was not quite fair on himself there. Kin! Rogojin\\r\\nreading a bookâ\\x80\\x94wasnâ\\x80\\x99t that sympathy beginning? Did it not show that he\\r\\ncomprehended his relations with her? And his story of waiting day and\\r\\nnight for her forgiveness? That didnâ\\x80\\x99t look quite like passion alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as to her face, could it inspire nothing but passion? Could her\\r\\nface inspire passion at all now? Oh, it inspired suffering, grief,\\r\\noverwhelming grief of the soul! A poignant, agonizing memory swept over\\r\\nthe princeâ\\x80\\x99s heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, agonizing. He remembered how he had suffered that first day when\\r\\nhe thought he observed in her the symptoms of madness. He had almost\\r\\nfallen into despair. How could he have lost his hold upon her when she\\r\\nran away from him to Rogojin? He ought to have run after her himself,\\r\\nrather than wait for news as he had done. Can Rogojin have failed to\\r\\nobserve, up to now, that she is mad? Rogojin attributes her strangeness\\r\\nto other causes, to passion! What insane jealousy! What was it he had\\r\\nhinted at in that suggestion of his? The prince suddenly blushed, and\\r\\nshuddered to his very heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut why recall all this? There was insanity on both sides. For him, the\\r\\nprince, to love this woman with passion, was unthinkable. It would be\\r\\ncruel and inhuman. Yes. Rogojin is not fair to himself; he has a large\\r\\nheart; he has aptitude for sympathy. When he learns the truth, and\\r\\nfinds what a pitiable being is this injured, broken, half-insane\\r\\ncreature, he will forgive her all the torment she has caused him. He\\r\\nwill become her slave, her brother, her friend. Compassion will teach\\r\\neven Rogojin, it will show him how to reason. Compassion is the chief\\r\\nlaw of human existence. Oh, how guilty he felt towards Rogojin! And,\\r\\nfor a few warm, hasty words spoken in Moscow, Parfen had called him\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbrother,â\\x80\\x9d while heâ\\x80\\x94but no, this was delirium! It would all come right!\\r\\nThat gloomy Parfen had implied that his faith was waning; he must\\r\\nsuffer dreadfully. He said he liked to look at that picture; it was not\\r\\nthat he liked it, but he felt the need of looking at it. Rogojin was\\r\\nnot merely a passionate soul; he was a fighter. He was fighting for the\\r\\nrestoration of his dying faith. He must have something to hold on to\\r\\nand believe, and someone to believe in. What a strange picture that of\\r\\nHolbeinâ\\x80\\x99s is! Why, this is the street, and hereâ\\x80\\x99s the house, No. 16.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince rang the bell, and asked for Nastasia Philipovna. The lady\\r\\nof the house came out, and stated that Nastasia had gone to stay with\\r\\nDaria Alexeyevna at Pavlofsk, and might be there some days.\\r\\n\\r\\nMadame Filisoff was a little woman of forty, with a cunning face, and\\r\\ncrafty, piercing eyes. When, with an air of mystery, she asked her\\r\\nvisitorâ\\x80\\x99s name, he refused at first to answer, but in a moment he\\r\\nchanged his mind, and left strict instructions that it should be given\\r\\nto Nastasia Philipovna. The urgency of his request seemed to impress\\r\\nMadame Filisoff, and she put on a knowing expression, as if to say,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou need not be afraid, I quite understand.â\\x80\\x9d The princeâ\\x80\\x99s name\\r\\nevidently was a great surprise to her. He stood and looked absently at\\r\\nher for a moment, then turned, and took the road back to his hotel. But\\r\\nhe went away not as he came. A great change had suddenly come over him.\\r\\nHe went blindly forward; his knees shook under him; he was tormented by\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cideasâ\\x80\\x9d; his lips were blue, and trembled with a feeble, meaningless\\r\\nsmile. His demon was upon him once more.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat had happened to him? Why was his brow clammy with drops of\\r\\nmoisture, his knees shaking beneath him, and his soul oppressed with a\\r\\ncold gloom? Was it because he had just seen these dreadful eyes again?\\r\\nWhy, he had left the Summer Garden on purpose to see them; that had\\r\\nbeen his â\\x80\\x9cidea.â\\x80\\x9d He had wished to assure himself that he would see them\\r\\nonce more at that house. Then why was he so overwhelmed now, having\\r\\nseen them as he expected? just as though he had not expected to see\\r\\nthem! Yes, they were the very same eyes; and no doubt about it. The\\r\\nsame that he had seen in the crowd that morning at the station, the\\r\\nsame that he had surprised in Rogojinâ\\x80\\x99s rooms some hours later, when\\r\\nthe latter had replied to his inquiry with a sneering laugh, â\\x80\\x9cWell,\\r\\nwhose eyes were they?â\\x80\\x9d Then for the third time they had appeared just\\r\\nas he was getting into the train on his way to see Aglaya. He had had a\\r\\nstrong impulse to rush up to Rogojin, and repeat his words of the\\r\\nmorning â\\x80\\x9cWhose eyes are they?â\\x80\\x9d Instead he had fled from the station,\\r\\nand knew nothing more, until he found himself gazing into the window of\\r\\na cutlerâ\\x80\\x99s shop, and wondering if a knife with a staghorn handle would\\r\\ncost more than sixty copecks. And as the prince sat dreaming in the\\r\\nSummer Garden under a lime-tree, a wicked demon had come and whispered\\r\\nin his car: â\\x80\\x9cRogojin has been spying upon you and watching you all the\\r\\nmorning in a frenzy of desperation. When he finds you have not gone to\\r\\nPavlofskâ\\x80\\x94a terrible discovery for himâ\\x80\\x94he will surely go at once to that\\r\\nhouse in Petersburg Side, and watch for you there, although only this\\r\\nmorning you gave your word of honour not to see _her_, and swore that\\r\\nyou had not come to Petersburg for that purpose.â\\x80\\x9d And thereupon the\\r\\nprince had hastened off to that house, and what was there in the fact\\r\\nthat he had met Rogojin there? He had only seen a wretched, suffering\\r\\ncreature, whose state of mind was gloomy and miserable, but most\\r\\ncomprehensible. In the morning Rogojin had seemed to be trying to keep\\r\\nout of the way; but at the station this afternoon he had stood out, he\\r\\nhad concealed himself, indeed, less than the prince himself; at the\\r\\nhouse, now, he had stood fifty yards off on the other side of the road,\\r\\nwith folded hands, watching, plainly in view and apparently desirous of\\r\\nbeing seen. He had stood there like an accuser, like a judge, not like\\r\\naâ\\x80\\x94a what?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd why had not the prince approached him and spoken to him, instead of\\r\\nturning away and pretending he had seen nothing, although their eyes\\r\\nmet? (Yes, their eyes had met, and they had looked at each other.) Why,\\r\\nhe had himself wished to take Rogojin by the hand and go in together,\\r\\nhe had himself determined to go to him on the morrow and tell him that\\r\\nhe had seen her, he had repudiated the demon as he walked to the house,\\r\\nand his heart had been full of joy.\\r\\n\\r\\nWas there something in the whole aspect of the man, today, sufficient\\r\\nto justify the princeâ\\x80\\x99s terror, and the awful suspicions of his demon?\\r\\nSomething seen, but indescribable, which filled him with dreadful\\r\\npresentiments? Yes, he was convinced of itâ\\x80\\x94convinced of what? (Oh, how\\r\\nmean and hideous of him to feel this conviction, this presentiment! How\\r\\nhe blamed himself for it!) â\\x80\\x9cSpeak if you dare, and tell me, what is the\\r\\npresentiment?â\\x80\\x9d he repeated to himself, over and over again. â\\x80\\x9cPut it\\r\\ninto words, speak out clearly and distinctly. Oh, miserable coward that\\r\\nI am!â\\x80\\x9d The prince flushed with shame for his own baseness. â\\x80\\x9cHow shall I\\r\\never look this man in the face again? My God, what a day! And what a\\r\\nnightmare, what a nightmare!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a moment, during this long, wretched walk back from the\\r\\nPetersburg Side, when the prince felt an irresistible desire to go\\r\\nstraight to Rogojinâ\\x80\\x99s, wait for him, embrace him with tears of shame\\r\\nand contrition, and tell him of his distrust, and finish with itâ\\x80\\x94once\\r\\nfor all.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut here he was back at his hotel.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow often during the day he had thought of this hotel with loathingâ\\x80\\x94its\\r\\ncorridor, its rooms, its stairs. How he had dreaded coming back to it,\\r\\nfor some reason.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat a regular old woman I am today,â\\x80\\x9d he had said to himself each\\r\\ntime, with annoyance. â\\x80\\x9cI believe in every foolish presentiment that\\r\\ncomes into my head.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stopped for a moment at the door; a great flush of shame came over\\r\\nhim. â\\x80\\x9cI am a coward, a wretched coward,â\\x80\\x9d he said, and moved forward\\r\\nagain; but once more he paused.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong all the incidents of the day, one recurred to his mind to the\\r\\nexclusion of the rest; although now that his self-control was regained,\\r\\nand he was no longer under the influence of a nightmare, he was able to\\r\\nthink of it calmly. It concerned the knife on Rogojinâ\\x80\\x99s table. â\\x80\\x9cWhy\\r\\nshould not Rogojin have as many knives on his table as he chooses?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nthought the prince, wondering at his suspicions, as he had done when he\\r\\nfound himself looking into the cutlerâ\\x80\\x99s window. â\\x80\\x9cWhat could it have to\\r\\ndo with me?â\\x80\\x9d he said to himself again, and stopped as if rooted to the\\r\\nground by a kind of paralysis of limb such as attacks people under the\\r\\nstress of some humiliating recollection.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doorway was dark and gloomy at any time; but just at this moment it\\r\\nwas rendered doubly so by the fact that the thunder-storm had just\\r\\nbroken, and the rain was coming down in torrents.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd in the semi-darkness the prince distinguished a man standing close\\r\\nto the stairs, apparently waiting.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was nothing particularly significant in the fact that a man was\\r\\nstanding back in the doorway, waiting to come out or go upstairs; but\\r\\nthe prince felt an irresistible conviction that he knew this man, and\\r\\nthat it was Rogojin. The man moved on up the stairs; a moment later the\\r\\nprince passed up them, too. His heart froze within him. â\\x80\\x9cIn a minute or\\r\\ntwo I shall know all,â\\x80\\x9d he thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe staircase led to the first and second corridors of the hotel, along\\r\\nwhich lay the guestsâ\\x80\\x99 bedrooms. As is often the case in Petersburg\\r\\nhouses, it was narrow and very dark, and turned around a massive stone\\r\\ncolumn.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the first landing, which was as small as the necessary turn of the\\r\\nstairs allowed, there was a niche in the column, about half a yard\\r\\nwide, and in this niche the prince felt convinced that a man stood\\r\\nconcealed. He thought he could distinguish a figure standing there. He\\r\\nwould pass by quickly and not look. He took a step forward, but could\\r\\nbear the uncertainty no longer and turned his head.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eyesâ\\x80\\x94the same two eyesâ\\x80\\x94met his! The man concealed in the niche had\\r\\nalso taken a step forward. For one second they stood face to face.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly the prince caught the man by the shoulder and twisted him\\r\\nround towards the light, so that he might see his face more clearly.\\r\\n\\r\\nRogojinâ\\x80\\x99s eyes flashed, and a smile of insanity distorted his\\r\\ncountenance. His right hand was raised, and something glittered in it.\\r\\nThe prince did not think of trying to stop it. All he could remember\\r\\nafterwards was that he seemed to have called out:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cParfen! I wonâ\\x80\\x99t believe it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNext moment something appeared to burst open before him: a wonderful\\r\\ninner light illuminated his soul. This lasted perhaps half a second,\\r\\nyet he distinctly remembered hearing the beginning of the wail, the\\r\\nstrange, dreadful wail, which burst from his lips of its own accord,\\r\\nand which no effort of will on his part could suppress.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext moment he was absolutely unconscious; black darkness blotted out\\r\\neverything.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had fallen in an epileptic fit.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs is well known, these fits occur instantaneously. The face,\\r\\nespecially the eyes, become terribly disfigured, convulsions seize the\\r\\nlimbs, a terrible cry breaks from the sufferer, a wail from which\\r\\neverything human seems to be blotted out, so that it is impossible to\\r\\nbelieve that the man who has just fallen is the same who emitted the\\r\\ndreadful cry. It seems more as though some other being, inside the\\r\\nstricken one, had cried. Many people have borne witness to this\\r\\nimpression; and many cannot behold an epileptic fit without a feeling\\r\\nof mysterious terror and dread.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch a feeling, we must suppose, overtook Rogojin at this moment, and\\r\\nsaved the princeâ\\x80\\x99s life. Not knowing that it was a fit, and seeing his\\r\\nvictim disappear head foremost into the darkness, hearing his head\\r\\nstrike the stone steps below with a crash, Rogojin rushed downstairs,\\r\\nskirting the body, and flung himself headlong out of the hotel, like a\\r\\nraving madman.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe princeâ\\x80\\x99s body slipped convulsively down the steps till it rested at\\r\\nthe bottom. Very soon, in five minutes or so, he was discovered, and a\\r\\ncrowd collected around him.\\r\\n\\r\\nA pool of blood on the steps near his head gave rise to grave fears.\\r\\nWas it a case of accident, or had there been a crime? It was, however,\\r\\nsoon recognized as a case of epilepsy, and identification and proper\\r\\nmeasures for restoration followed one another, owing to a fortunate\\r\\ncircumstance. Colia Ivolgin had come back to his hotel about seven\\r\\noâ\\x80\\x99clock, owing to a sudden impulse which made him refuse to dine at the\\r\\nEpanchinsâ\\x80\\x99, and, finding a note from the prince awaiting him, had sped\\r\\naway to the latterâ\\x80\\x99s address. Arrived there, he ordered a cup of tea\\r\\nand sat sipping it in the coffee-room. While there he heard excited\\r\\nwhispers of someone just found at the bottom of the stairs in a fit;\\r\\nupon which he had hurried to the spot, with a presentiment of evil, and\\r\\nat once recognized the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sufferer was immediately taken to his room, and though he partially\\r\\nregained consciousness, he lay long in a semi-dazed condition.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctor stated that there was no danger to be apprehended from the\\r\\nwound on the head, and as soon as the prince could understand what was\\r\\ngoing on around him, Colia hired a carriage and took him away to\\r\\nLebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s. There he was received with much cordiality, and the\\r\\ndeparture to the country was hastened on his account. Three days later\\r\\nthey were all at Pavlofsk.\\r\\n\\r\\nVI.\\r\\n\\r\\nLebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s country-house was not large, but it was pretty and\\r\\nconvenient, especially the part which was let to the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nA row of orange and lemon trees and jasmines, planted in green tubs,\\r\\nstood on the fairly wide terrace. According to Lebedeff, these trees\\r\\ngave the house a most delightful aspect. Some were there when he bought\\r\\nit, and he was so charmed with the effect that he promptly added to\\r\\ntheir number. When the tubs containing these plants arrived at the\\r\\nvilla and were set in their places, Lebedeff kept running into the\\r\\nstreet to enjoy the view of the house, and every time he did so the\\r\\nrent to be demanded from the future tenant went up with a bound.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis country villa pleased the prince very much in his state of\\r\\nphysical and mental exhaustion. On the day that they left for Pavlofsk,\\r\\nthat is the day after his attack, he appeared almost well, though in\\r\\nreality he felt very far from it. The faces of those around him for the\\r\\nlast three days had made a pleasant impression. He was pleased to see,\\r\\nnot only Colia, who had become his inseparable companion, but Lebedeff\\r\\nhimself and all the family, except the nephew, who had left the house.\\r\\nHe was also glad to receive a visit from General Ivolgin, before\\r\\nleaving St. Petersburg.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was getting late when the party arrived at Pavlofsk, but several\\r\\npeople called to see the prince, and assembled in the verandah. Gania\\r\\nwas the first to arrive. He had grown so pale and thin that the prince\\r\\ncould hardly recognize him. Then came Varia and Ptitsin, who were\\r\\nrusticating in the neighbourhood. As to General Ivolgin, he scarcely\\r\\nbudged from Lebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s house, and seemed to have moved to Pavlofsk with\\r\\nhim. Lebedeff did his best to keep Ardalion Alexandrovitch by him, and\\r\\nto prevent him from invading the princeâ\\x80\\x99s quarters. He chatted with him\\r\\nconfidentially, so that they might have been taken for old friends.\\r\\nDuring those three days the prince had noticed that they frequently\\r\\nheld long conversations; he often heard their voices raised in argument\\r\\non deep and learned subjects, which evidently pleased Lebedeff. He\\r\\nseemed as if he could not do without the general. But it was not only\\r\\nArdalion Alexandrovitch whom Lebedeff kept out of the princeâ\\x80\\x99s way.\\r\\nSince they had come to the villa, he treated his own family the same.\\r\\nUpon the pretext that his tenant needed quiet, he kept him almost in\\r\\nisolation, and Muishkin protested in vain against this excess of zeal.\\r\\nLebedeff stamped his feet at his daughters and drove them away if they\\r\\nattempted to join the prince on the terrace; not even Vera was\\r\\nexcepted.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey will lose all respect if they are allowed to be so free and easy;\\r\\nbesides it is not proper for them,â\\x80\\x9d he declared at last, in answer to a\\r\\ndirect question from the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy on earth not?â\\x80\\x9d asked the latter. â\\x80\\x9cReally, you know, you are making\\r\\nyourself a nuisance, by keeping guard over me like this. I get bored\\r\\nall by myself; I have told you so over and over again, and you get on\\r\\nmy nerves more than ever by waving your hands and creeping in and out\\r\\nin the mysterious way you do.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a fact that Lebedeff, though he was so anxious to keep everyone\\r\\nelse from disturbing the patient, was continually in and out of the\\r\\nprinceâ\\x80\\x99s room himself. He invariably began by opening the door a crack\\r\\nand peering in to see if the prince was there, or if he had escaped;\\r\\nthen he would creep softly up to the arm-chair, sometimes making\\r\\nMuishkin jump by his sudden appearance. He always asked if the patient\\r\\nwanted anything, and when the latter replied that he only wanted to be\\r\\nleft in peace, he would turn away obediently and make for the door on\\r\\ntip-toe, with deprecatory gestures to imply that he had only just\\r\\nlooked in, that he would not speak a word, and would go away and not\\r\\nintrude again; which did not prevent him from reappearing in ten\\r\\nminutes or a quarter of an hour. Colia had free access to the prince,\\r\\nat which Lebedeff was quite disgusted and indignant. He would listen at\\r\\nthe door for half an hour at a time while the two were talking. Colia\\r\\nfound this out, and naturally told the prince of his discovery.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you think yourself my master, that you try to keep me under lock\\r\\nand key like this?â\\x80\\x9d said the prince to Lebedeff. â\\x80\\x9cIn the country, at\\r\\nleast, I intend to be free, and you may make up your mind that I mean\\r\\nto see whom I like, and go where I please.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, of course,â\\x80\\x9d replied the clerk, gesticulating with his hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince looked him sternly up and down.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, Lukian Timofeyovitch, have you brought the little cupboard that\\r\\nyou had at the head of your bed with you here?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I left it where it was.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cImpossible!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt cannot be moved; you would have to pull the wall down, it is so\\r\\nfirmly fixed.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPerhaps you have one like it here?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have one that is even better, much better; that is really why I\\r\\nbought this house.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh! What visitor did you turn away from my door, about an hour ago?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe-the general. I would not let him in; there is no need for him to\\r\\nvisit you, prince... I have the deepest esteem for him, he is aâ\\x80\\x94a great\\r\\nman. You donâ\\x80\\x99t believe it? Well, you will see, and yet, most excellent\\r\\nprince, you had much better not receive him.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMay I ask why? and also why you walk about on tiptoe and always seem\\r\\nas if you were going to whisper a secret in my ear whenever you come\\r\\nnear me?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am vile, vile; I know it!â\\x80\\x9d cried Lebedeff, beating his breast with a\\r\\ncontrite air. â\\x80\\x9cBut will not the general be too hospitable for you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cToo hospitable?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes. First, he proposes to come and live in my house. Well and good;\\r\\nbut he sticks at nothing; he immediately makes himself one of the\\r\\nfamily. We have talked over our respective relations several times, and\\r\\ndiscovered that we are connected by marriage. It seems also that you\\r\\nare a sort of nephew on his motherâ\\x80\\x99s side; he was explaining it to me\\r\\nagain only yesterday. If you are his nephew, it follows that I must\\r\\nalso be a relation of yours, most excellent prince. Never mind about\\r\\nthat, it is only a foible; but just now he assured me that all his\\r\\nlife, from the day he was made an ensign to the 11th of last June, he\\r\\nhas entertained at least two hundred guests at his table every day.\\r\\nFinally, he went so far as to say that they never rose from the table;\\r\\nthey dined, supped, and had tea, for fifteen hours at a stretch. This\\r\\nwent on for thirty years without a break; there was barely time to\\r\\nchange the table-cloth; directly one person left, another took his\\r\\nplace. On feast-days he entertained as many as three hundred guests,\\r\\nand they numbered seven hundred on the thousandth anniversary of the\\r\\nfoundation of the Russian Empire. It amounts to a passion with him; it\\r\\nmakes one uneasy to hear of it. It is terrible to have to entertain\\r\\npeople who do things on such a scale. That is why I wonder whether such\\r\\na man is not too hospitable for you and me.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut you seem to be on the best of terms with him?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuite fraternalâ\\x80\\x94I look upon it as a joke. Let us be brothers-in-law,\\r\\nit is all the same to me,â\\x80\\x94rather an honour than not. But in spite of\\r\\nthe two hundred guests and the thousandth anniversary of the Russian\\r\\nEmpire, I can see that he is a very remarkable man. I am quite sincere.\\r\\nYou said just now that I always looked as if I was going to tell you a\\r\\nsecret; you are right. I have a secret to tell you: a certain person\\r\\nhas just let me know that she is very anxious for a secret interview\\r\\nwith you.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy should it be secret? Not at all; I will call on her myself\\r\\ntomorrow.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, oh no!â\\x80\\x9d cried Lebedeff, waving his arms; â\\x80\\x9cif she is afraid, it is\\r\\nnot for the reason you think. By the way, do you know that the monster\\r\\ncomes every day to inquire after your health?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou call him a monster so often that it makes me suspicious.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou must have no suspicions, none whatever,â\\x80\\x9d said Lebedeff quickly. â\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nonly want you to know that the person in question is not afraid of him,\\r\\nbut of something quite, quite different.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat on earth is she afraid of, then? Tell me plainly, without any\\r\\nmore beating about the bush,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, exasperated by the\\r\\notherâ\\x80\\x99s mysterious grimaces.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh that is the secret,â\\x80\\x9d said Lebedeff, with a smile.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhose secret?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYours. You forbade me yourself to mention it before you, most\\r\\nexcellent prince,â\\x80\\x9d murmured Lebedeff. Then, satisfied that he had\\r\\nworked up Muishkinâ\\x80\\x99s curiosity to the highest pitch, he added abruptly:\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe is afraid of Aglaya Ivanovna.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince frowned for a moment in silence, and then said suddenly:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cReally, Lebedeff, I must leave your house. Where are Gavrila\\r\\nArdalionovitch and the Ptitsins? Are they here? Have you chased them\\r\\naway, too?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey are coming, they are coming; and the general as well. I will open\\r\\nall the doors; I will call all my daughters, all of them, this very\\r\\nminute,â\\x80\\x9d said Lebedeff in a low voice, thoroughly frightened, and\\r\\nwaving his hands as he ran from door to door.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment Colia appeared on the terrace; he announced that\\r\\nLizabetha Prokofievna and her three daughters were close behind him.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoved by this news, Lebedeff hurried up to the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShall I call the Ptitsins, and Gavrila Ardalionovitch? Shall I let the\\r\\ngeneral in?â\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy not? Let in anyone who wants to see me. I assure you, Lebedeff,\\r\\nyou have misunderstood my position from the very first; you have been\\r\\nwrong all along. I have not the slightest reason to hide myself from\\r\\nanyone,â\\x80\\x9d replied the prince gaily.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeeing him laugh, Lebedeff thought fit to laugh also, and though much\\r\\nagitated his satisfaction was quite visible.\\r\\n\\r\\nColia was right; the Epanchin ladies were only a few steps behind him.\\r\\nAs they approached the terrace other visitors appeared from Lebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nside of the houseâ\\x80\\x94the Ptitsins, Gania, and Ardalion Alexandrovitch.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Epanchins had only just heard of the princeâ\\x80\\x99s illness and of his\\r\\npresence in Pavlofsk, from Colia; and up to this time had been in a\\r\\nstate of considerable bewilderment about him. The general brought the\\r\\nprinceâ\\x80\\x99s card down from town, and Mrs. Epanchin had felt convinced that\\r\\nhe himself would follow his card at once; she was much excited.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn vain the girls assured her that a man who had not written for six\\r\\nmonths would not be in such a dreadful hurry, and that probably he had\\r\\nenough to do in town without needing to bustle down to Pavlofsk to see\\r\\nthem. Their mother was quite angry at the very idea of such a thing,\\r\\nand announced her absolute conviction that he would turn up the next\\r\\nday at latest.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo next day the prince was expected all the morning, and at dinner,\\r\\ntea, and supper; and when he did not appear in the evening, Mrs.\\r\\nEpanchin quarrelled with everyone in the house, finding plenty of\\r\\npretexts without so much as mentioning the princeâ\\x80\\x99s name.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the third day there was no talk of him at all, until Aglaya remarked\\r\\nat dinner: â\\x80\\x9cMamma is cross because the prince hasnâ\\x80\\x99t turned up,â\\x80\\x9d to\\r\\nwhich the general replied that it was not his fault.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Epanchin misunderstood the observation, and rising from her place\\r\\nshe left the room in majestic wrath. In the evening, however, Colia\\r\\ncame with the story of the princeâ\\x80\\x99s adventures, so far as he knew them.\\r\\nMrs. Epanchin was triumphant; although Colia had to listen to a long\\r\\nlecture. â\\x80\\x9cHe idles about here the whole day long, one canâ\\x80\\x99t get rid of\\r\\nhim; and then when he is wanted he does not come. He might have sent a\\r\\nline if he did not wish to inconvenience himself.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the words â\\x80\\x9cone canâ\\x80\\x99t get rid of him,â\\x80\\x9d Colia was very angry, and\\r\\nnearly flew into a rage; but he resolved to be quiet for the time and\\r\\nshow his resentment later. If the words had been less offensive he\\r\\nmight have forgiven them, so pleased was he to see Lizabetha\\r\\nProkofievna worried and anxious about the princeâ\\x80\\x99s illness.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe would have insisted on sending to Petersburg at once, for a certain\\r\\ngreat medical celebrity; but her daughters dissuaded her, though they\\r\\nwere not willing to stay behind when she at once prepared to go and\\r\\nvisit the invalid. Aglaya, however, suggested that it was a little\\r\\nunceremonious to go _en masse_ to see him.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery well then, stay at home,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Epanchin, â\\x80\\x9cand a good thing\\r\\ntoo, for Evgenie Pavlovitch is coming down and there will be no one at\\r\\nhome to receive him.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, after this, Aglaya went with the rest. In fact, she had\\r\\nnever had the slightest intention of doing otherwise.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrince S., who was in the house, was requested to escort the ladies. He\\r\\nhad been much interested when he first heard of the prince from the\\r\\nEpanchins. It appeared that they had known one another before, and had\\r\\nspent some time together in a little provincial town three months ago.\\r\\nPrince S. had greatly taken to him, and was delighted with the\\r\\nopportunity of meeting him again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general had not come down from town as yet, nor had Evgenie\\r\\nPavlovitch arrived.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not more than two or three hundred yards from the Epanchinsâ\\x80\\x99\\r\\nhouse to Lebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s. The first disagreeable impression experienced by\\r\\nMrs. Epanchin was to find the prince surrounded by a whole assembly of\\r\\nother guestsâ\\x80\\x94not to mention the fact that some of those present were\\r\\nparticularly detestable in her eyes. The next annoying circumstance was\\r\\nwhen an apparently strong and healthy young fellow, well dressed, and\\r\\nsmiling, came forward to meet her on the terrace, instead of the\\r\\nhalf-dying unfortunate whom she had expected to see.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was astonished and vexed, and her disappointment pleased Colia\\r\\nimmensely. Of course he could have undeceived her before she started,\\r\\nbut the mischievous boy had been careful not to do that, foreseeing the\\r\\nprobably laughable disgust that she would experience when she found her\\r\\ndear friend, the prince, in good health. Colia was indelicate enough to\\r\\nvoice the delight he felt at his success in managing to annoy Lizabetha\\r\\nProkofievna, with whom, in spite of their really amicable relations, he\\r\\nwas constantly sparring.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cJust wait a while, my boy!â\\x80\\x9d said she; â\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t be too certain of your\\r\\ntriumph.â\\x80\\x9d And she sat down heavily, in the arm-chair pushed forward by\\r\\nthe prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nLebedeff, Ptitsin, and General Ivolgin hastened to find chairs for the\\r\\nyoung ladies. Varia greeted them joyfully, and they exchanged\\r\\nconfidences in ecstatic whispers.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI must admit, prince, I was a little put out to see you up and about\\r\\nlike thisâ\\x80\\x94I expected to find you in bed; but I give you my word, I was\\r\\nonly annoyed for an instant, before I collected my thoughts properly. I\\r\\nam always wiser on second thoughts, and I dare say you are the same. I\\r\\nassure you I am as glad to see you well as though you were my own\\r\\nson,â\\x80\\x94yes, and more; and if you donâ\\x80\\x99t believe me the more shame to you,\\r\\nand itâ\\x80\\x99s not my fault. But that spiteful boy delights in playing all\\r\\nsorts of tricks. You are his patron, it seems. Well, I warn you that\\r\\none fine morning I shall deprive myself of the pleasure of his further\\r\\nacquaintance.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat have I done wrong now?â\\x80\\x9d cried Colia. â\\x80\\x9cWhat was the good of\\r\\ntelling you that the prince was nearly well again? You would not have\\r\\nbelieved me; it was so much more interesting to picture him on his\\r\\ndeath-bed.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow long do you remain here, prince?â\\x80\\x9d asked Madame Epanchin.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAll the summer, and perhaps longer.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are alone, arenâ\\x80\\x99t you,â\\x80\\x94not married?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, Iâ\\x80\\x99m not married!â\\x80\\x9d replied the prince, smiling at the ingenuousness\\r\\nof this little feeler.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, you neednâ\\x80\\x99t laugh! These things do happen, you know! Now thenâ\\x80\\x94why\\r\\ndidnâ\\x80\\x99t you come to us? We have a wing quite empty. But just as you\\r\\nlike, of course. Do you lease it from _him?_â\\x80\\x94this fellow, I mean,â\\x80\\x9d she\\r\\nadded, nodding towards Lebedeff. â\\x80\\x9cAnd why does he always wriggle so?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment Vera, carrying the baby in her arms as usual, came out\\r\\nof the house, on to the terrace. Lebedeff kept fidgeting among the\\r\\nchairs, and did not seem to know what to do with himself, though he had\\r\\nno intention of going away. He no sooner caught sight of his daughter,\\r\\nthan he rushed in her direction, waving his arms to keep her away; he\\r\\neven forgot himself so far as to stamp his foot.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs he mad?â\\x80\\x9d asked Madame Epanchin suddenly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, he...â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPerhaps he is drunk? Your company is rather peculiar,â\\x80\\x9d she added, with\\r\\na glance at the other guests....\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut what a pretty girl! Who is she?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is Lebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s daughterâ\\x80\\x94Vera Lukianovna.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIndeed? She looks very sweet. I should like to make her acquaintance.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe words were hardly out of her mouth, when Lebedeff dragged Vera\\r\\nforward, in order to present her.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOrphans, poor orphans!â\\x80\\x9d he began in a pathetic voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe child she carries is an orphan, too. She is Veraâ\\x80\\x99s sister, my\\r\\ndaughter Luboff. The day this babe was born, six weeks ago, my wife\\r\\ndied, by the will of God Almighty.... Yes... Vera takes her motherâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nplace, though she is but her sister... nothing more... nothing more...â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd you! You are nothing more than a fool, if youâ\\x80\\x99ll excuse me! Well!\\r\\nwell! you know that yourself, I expect,â\\x80\\x9d said the lady indignantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nLebedeff bowed low. â\\x80\\x9cIt is the truth,â\\x80\\x9d he replied, with extreme\\r\\nrespect.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, Mr. Lebedeff, I am told you lecture on the Apocalypse. Is it\\r\\ntrue?â\\x80\\x9d asked Aglaya.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, that is so... for the last fifteen years.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have heard of you, and I think read of you in the newspapers.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, that was another commentator, whom the papers named. He is dead,\\r\\nhowever, and I have taken his place,â\\x80\\x9d said the other, much delighted.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe are neighbours, so will you be so kind as to come over one day and\\r\\nexplain the Apocalypse to me?â\\x80\\x9d said Aglaya. â\\x80\\x9cI do not understand it in\\r\\nthe least.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAllow me to warn you,â\\x80\\x9d interposed General Ivolgin, â\\x80\\x9cthat he is the\\r\\ngreatest charlatan on earth.â\\x80\\x9d He had taken the chair next to the girl,\\r\\nand was impatient to begin talking. â\\x80\\x9cNo doubt there are pleasures and\\r\\namusements peculiar to the country,â\\x80\\x9d he continued, â\\x80\\x9cand to listen to a\\r\\npretended student holding forth on the book of the Revelations may be\\r\\nas good as any other. It may even be original. But... you seem to be\\r\\nlooking at me with some surpriseâ\\x80\\x94may I introduce myselfâ\\x80\\x94General\\r\\nIvolginâ\\x80\\x94I carried you in my arms as a babyâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDelighted, Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure,â\\x80\\x9d said Aglaya; â\\x80\\x9cI am acquainted with Varvara\\r\\nArdalionovna and Nina Alexandrovna.â\\x80\\x9d She was trying hard to restrain\\r\\nherself from laughing.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Epanchin flushed up; some accumulation of spleen in her suddenly\\r\\nneeded an outlet. She could not bear this General Ivolgin whom she had\\r\\nonce known, long agoâ\\x80\\x94in society.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are deviating from the truth, sir, as usual!â\\x80\\x9d she remarked,\\r\\nboiling over with indignation; â\\x80\\x9cyou never carried her in your life!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have forgotten, mother,â\\x80\\x9d said Aglaya, suddenly. â\\x80\\x9cHe really did\\r\\ncarry me about,â\\x80\\x94in Tver, you know. I was six years old, I remember. He\\r\\nmade me a bow and arrow, and I shot a pigeon. Donâ\\x80\\x99t you remember\\r\\nshooting a pigeon, you and I, one day?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, and he made me a cardboard helmet, and a little wooden swordâ\\x80\\x94I\\r\\nremember!â\\x80\\x9d said Adelaida.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I remember too!â\\x80\\x9d said Alexandra. â\\x80\\x9cYou quarrelled about the\\r\\nwounded pigeon, and Adelaida was put in the corner, and stood there\\r\\nwith her helmet and sword and all.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poor general had merely made the remark about having carried Aglaya\\r\\nin his arms because he always did so begin a conversation with young\\r\\npeople. But it happened that this time he had really hit upon the\\r\\ntruth, though he had himself entirely forgotten the fact. But when\\r\\nAdelaida and Aglaya recalled the episode of the pigeon, his mind became\\r\\nfilled with memories, and it is impossible to describe how this poor\\r\\nold man, usually half drunk, was moved by the recollection.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI rememberâ\\x80\\x94I remember it all!â\\x80\\x9d he cried. â\\x80\\x9cI was captain then. You were\\r\\nsuch a lovely little thingâ\\x80\\x94Nina Alexandrovna!â\\x80\\x94Gania, listen! I was\\r\\nreceived then by General Epanchin.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, and look what you have come to now!â\\x80\\x9d interrupted Mrs. Epanchin.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHowever, I see you have not quite drunk your better feelings away. But\\r\\nyouâ\\x80\\x99ve broken your wifeâ\\x80\\x99s heart, sirâ\\x80\\x94and instead of looking after your\\r\\nchildren, you have spent your time in public-houses and debtorsâ\\x80\\x99\\r\\nprisons! Go away, my friend, stand in some corner and weep, and bemoan\\r\\nyour fallen dignity, and perhaps God will forgive you yet! Go, go! Iâ\\x80\\x99m\\r\\nserious! Thereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing so favourable for repentance as to think of\\r\\nthe past with feelings of remorse!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no need to repeat that she was serious. The general, like all\\r\\ndrunkards, was extremely emotional and easily touched by recollections\\r\\nof his better days. He rose and walked quietly to the door, so meekly\\r\\nthat Mrs. Epanchin was instantly sorry for him.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cArdalion Alexandrovitch,â\\x80\\x9d she cried after him, â\\x80\\x9cwait a moment, we are\\r\\nall sinners! When you feel that your conscience reproaches you a little\\r\\nless, come over to me and weâ\\x80\\x99ll have a talk about the past! I dare say\\r\\nI am fifty times more of a sinner than you are! And now go, go,\\r\\ngood-bye, you had better not stay here!â\\x80\\x9d she added, in alarm, as he\\r\\nturned as though to come back.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t go after him just now, Colia, or heâ\\x80\\x99ll be vexed, and the benefit\\r\\nof this moment will be lost!â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, as the boy was hurrying\\r\\nout of the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuite true! Much better to go in half an hour or so,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs.\\r\\nEpanchin.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s what comes of telling the truth for once in oneâ\\x80\\x99s life!â\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nLebedeff. â\\x80\\x9cIt reduced him to tears.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome, come! the less _you_ say about it the betterâ\\x80\\x94to judge from all I\\r\\nhave heard about you!â\\x80\\x9d replied Mrs. Epanchin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince took the first opportunity of informing the Epanchin ladies\\r\\nthat he had intended to pay them a visit that day, if they had not\\r\\nthemselves come this afternoon, and Lizabetha Prokofievna replied that\\r\\nshe hoped he would still do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time some of the visitors had disappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nPtitsin had tactfully retreated to Lebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s wing; and Gania soon\\r\\nfollowed him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe latter had behaved modestly, but with dignity, on this occasion of\\r\\nhis first meeting with the Epanchins since the rupture. Twice Mrs.\\r\\nEpanchin had deliberately examined him from head to foot; but he had\\r\\nstood fire without flinching. He was certainly much changed, as anyone\\r\\ncould see who had not met him for some time; and this fact seemed to\\r\\nafford Aglaya a good deal of satisfaction.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat was Gavrila Ardalionovitch, who just went out, wasnâ\\x80\\x99t it?â\\x80\\x9d she\\r\\nasked suddenly, interrupting somebody elseâ\\x80\\x99s conversation to make the\\r\\nremark.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, it was,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI hardly knew him; he is much changed, and for the better!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am very glad,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe has been very ill,â\\x80\\x9d added Varia.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow has he changed for the better?â\\x80\\x9d asked Mrs. Epanchin. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t see\\r\\nany change for the better! Whatâ\\x80\\x99s better in him? Where did you get\\r\\n_that_ idea from? _what_â\\x80\\x99s better?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing better than the â\\x80\\x98poor knightâ\\x80\\x99!â\\x80\\x9d said Colia, who was\\r\\nstanding near the last speakerâ\\x80\\x99s chair.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI quite agree with you there!â\\x80\\x9d said Prince S., laughing.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo do I,â\\x80\\x9d said Adelaida, solemnly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_What_ poor knight?â\\x80\\x9d asked Mrs. Epanchin, looking round at the face of\\r\\neach of the speakers in turn. Seeing, however, that Aglaya was\\r\\nblushing, she added, angrily:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat nonsense you are all talking! What do you mean by poor knight?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s not the first time this urchin, your favourite, has shown his\\r\\nimpudence by twisting other peopleâ\\x80\\x99s words,â\\x80\\x9d said Aglaya, haughtily.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery time that Aglaya showed temper (and this was very often), there\\r\\nwas so much childish pouting, such â\\x80\\x9cschool-girlishness,â\\x80\\x9d as it were, in\\r\\nher apparent wrath, that it was impossible to avoid smiling at her, to\\r\\nher own unutterable indignation. On these occasions she would say, â\\x80\\x9cHow\\r\\ncan they, how _dare_ they laugh at me?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis time everyone laughed at her, her sisters, Prince S., Prince\\r\\nMuishkin (though he himself had flushed for some reason), and Colia.\\r\\nAglaya was dreadfully indignant, and looked twice as pretty in her\\r\\nwrath.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s always twisting round what one says,â\\x80\\x9d she cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am only repeating your own exclamation!â\\x80\\x9d said Colia. â\\x80\\x9cA month ago\\r\\nyou were turning over the pages of your Don Quixote, and suddenly\\r\\ncalled out â\\x80\\x98there is nothing better than the poor knight.â\\x80\\x99 I donâ\\x80\\x99t know\\r\\nwhom you were referring to, of course, whether to Don Quixote, or\\r\\nEvgenie Pavlovitch, or someone else, but you certainly said these\\r\\nwords, and afterwards there was a long conversation...â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are inclined to go a little too far, my good boy, with your\\r\\nguesses,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Epanchin, with some show of annoyance.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut itâ\\x80\\x99s not I alone,â\\x80\\x9d cried Colia. â\\x80\\x9cThey all talked about it, and\\r\\nthey do still. Why, just now Prince S. and Adelaida Ivanovna declared\\r\\nthat they upheld â\\x80\\x98the poor knightâ\\x80\\x99; so evidently there does exist a\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98poor knightâ\\x80\\x99; and if it were not for Adelaida Ivanovna, we should have\\r\\nknown long ago who the â\\x80\\x98poor knightâ\\x80\\x99 was.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, how am I to blame?â\\x80\\x9d asked Adelaida, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t draw his portrait for us, thatâ\\x80\\x99s why you are to blame!\\r\\nAglaya Ivanovna asked you to draw his portrait, and gave you the whole\\r\\nsubject of the picture. She invented it herself; and you wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat was I to draw? According to the lines she quoted:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98From his face he never lifted\\r\\nThat eternal mask of steel.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat sort of a face was I to draw? I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t draw a mask.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know what you are driving at; what mask do you mean?â\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nMrs. Epanchin, irritably. She began to see pretty clearly though what\\r\\nit meant, and whom they referred to by the generally accepted title of\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cpoor knight.â\\x80\\x9d But what specially annoyed her was that the prince was\\r\\nlooking so uncomfortable, and blushing like a ten-year-old child.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, have you finished your silly joke?â\\x80\\x9d she added, â\\x80\\x9cand am I to be\\r\\ntold what this â\\x80\\x98poor knightâ\\x80\\x99 means, or is it a solemn secret which\\r\\ncannot be approached lightly?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut they all laughed on.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s simply that there is a Russian poem,â\\x80\\x9d began Prince S., evidently\\r\\nanxious to change the conversation, â\\x80\\x9ca strange thing, without beginning\\r\\nor end, and all about a â\\x80\\x98poor knight.â\\x80\\x99 A month or so ago, we were all\\r\\ntalking and laughing, and looking up a subject for one of Adelaidaâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\npicturesâ\\x80\\x94you know it is the principal business of this family to find\\r\\nsubjects for Adelaidaâ\\x80\\x99s pictures. Well, we happened upon this â\\x80\\x98poor\\r\\nknight.â\\x80\\x99 I donâ\\x80\\x99t remember who thought of it firstâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh! Aglaya Ivanovna did,â\\x80\\x9d said Colia.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery likelyâ\\x80\\x94I donâ\\x80\\x99t recollect,â\\x80\\x9d continued Prince S.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSome of us laughed at the subject; some liked it; but she declared\\r\\nthat, in order to make a picture of the gentleman, she must first see\\r\\nhis face. We then began to think over all our friendsâ\\x80\\x99 faces to see if\\r\\nany of them would do, and none suited us, and so the matter stood;\\r\\nthatâ\\x80\\x99s all. I donâ\\x80\\x99t know why Nicolai Ardalionovitch has brought up the\\r\\njoke now. What was appropriate and funny then, has quite lost all\\r\\ninterest by this time.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cProbably thereâ\\x80\\x99s some new silliness about it,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Epanchin,\\r\\nsarcastically.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere is no silliness about it at allâ\\x80\\x94only the profoundest respect,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nsaid Aglaya, very seriously. She had quite recovered her temper; in\\r\\nfact, from certain signs, it was fair to conclude that she was\\r\\ndelighted to see this joke going so far; and a careful observer might\\r\\nhave remarked that her satisfaction dated from the moment when the fact\\r\\nof the princeâ\\x80\\x99s confusion became apparent to all.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Profoundest respect!â\\x80\\x99 What nonsense! First, insane giggling, and\\r\\nthen, all of a sudden, a display of â\\x80\\x98profoundest respect.â\\x80\\x99 Why respect?\\r\\nTell me at once, why have you suddenly developed this â\\x80\\x98profound\\r\\nrespect,â\\x80\\x99 eh?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBecause,â\\x80\\x9d replied Aglaya gravely, â\\x80\\x9cin the poem the knight is described\\r\\nas a man capable of living up to an ideal all his life. That sort of\\r\\nthing is not to be found every day among the men of our times. In the\\r\\npoem it is not stated exactly what the ideal was, but it was evidently\\r\\nsome vision, some revelation of pure Beauty, and the knight wore round\\r\\nhis neck, instead of a scarf, a rosary. A deviceâ\\x80\\x94A. N. B.â\\x80\\x94the meaning\\r\\nof which is not explained, was inscribed on his shieldâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, A. N. D.,â\\x80\\x9d corrected Colia.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI say A. N. B., and so it shall be!â\\x80\\x9d cried Aglaya, irritably. â\\x80\\x9cAnyway,\\r\\nthe â\\x80\\x98poor knightâ\\x80\\x99 did not care what his lady was, or what she did. He\\r\\nhad chosen his ideal, and he was bound to serve her, and break lances\\r\\nfor her, and acknowledge her as the ideal of pure Beauty, whatever she\\r\\nmight say or do afterwards. If she had taken to stealing, he would have\\r\\nchampioned her just the same. I think the poet desired to embody in\\r\\nthis one picture the whole spirit of medieval chivalry and the platonic\\r\\nlove of a pure and high-souled knight. Of course itâ\\x80\\x99s all an ideal, and\\r\\nin the â\\x80\\x98poor knightâ\\x80\\x99 that spirit reached the utmost limit of\\r\\nasceticism. He is a Don Quixote, only serious and not comical. I used\\r\\nnot to understand him, and laughed at him, but now I love the â\\x80\\x98poor\\r\\nknight,â\\x80\\x99 and respect his actions.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo ended Aglaya; and, to look at her, it was difficult, indeed, to\\r\\njudge whether she was joking or in earnest.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPooh! he was a fool, and his actions were the actions of a fool,â\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nMrs. Epanchin; â\\x80\\x9cand as for you, young woman, you ought to know better.\\r\\nAt all events, you are not to talk like that again. What poem is it?\\r\\nRecite it! I want to hear this poem! I have hated poetry all my life.\\r\\nPrince, you must excuse this nonsense. We neither of us like this sort\\r\\nof thing! Be patient!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey certainly were put out, both of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince tried to say something, but he was too confused, and could\\r\\nnot get his words out. Aglaya, who had taken such liberties in her\\r\\nlittle speech, was the only person present, perhaps, who was not in the\\r\\nleast embarrassed. She seemed, in fact, quite pleased.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe now rose solemnly from her seat, walked to the centre of the\\r\\nterrace, and stood in front of the princeâ\\x80\\x99s chair. All looked on with\\r\\nsome surprise, and Prince S. and her sisters with feelings of decided\\r\\nalarm, to see what new frolic she was up to; it had gone quite far\\r\\nenough already, they thought. But Aglaya evidently thoroughly enjoyed\\r\\nthe affectation and ceremony with which she was introducing her\\r\\nrecitation of the poem.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Epanchin was just wondering whether she would not forbid the\\r\\nperformance after all, when, at the very moment that Aglaya commenced\\r\\nher declamation, two new guests, both talking loudly, entered from the\\r\\nstreet. The new arrivals were General Epanchin and a young man.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir entrance caused some slight commotion.\\r\\n\\r\\nVII.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young fellow accompanying the general was about twenty-eight, tall,\\r\\nand well built, with a handsome and clever face, and bright black eyes,\\r\\nfull of fun and intelligence.\\r\\n\\r\\nAglaya did not so much as glance at the new arrivals, but went on with\\r\\nher recitation, gazing at the prince the while in an affected manner,\\r\\nand at him alone. It was clear to him that she was doing all this with\\r\\nsome special object.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the new guests at least somewhat eased his strained and\\r\\nuncomfortable position. Seeing them approaching, he rose from his\\r\\nchair, and nodding amicably to the general, signed to him not to\\r\\ninterrupt the recitation. He then got behind his chair, and stood there\\r\\nwith his left hand resting on the back of it. Thanks to this change of\\r\\nposition, he was able to listen to the ballad with far less\\r\\nembarrassment than before. Mrs. Epanchin had also twice motioned to the\\r\\nnew arrivals to be quiet, and stay where they were.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince was much interested in the young man who had just entered.\\r\\nHe easily concluded that this was Evgenie Pavlovitch Radomski, of whom\\r\\nhe had already heard mention several times. He was puzzled, however, by\\r\\nthe young manâ\\x80\\x99s plain clothes, for he had always heard of Evgenie\\r\\nPavlovitch as a military man. An ironical smile played on Evgenieâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nlips all the while the recitation was proceeding, which showed that he,\\r\\ntoo, was probably in the secret of the â\\x80\\x98poor knightâ\\x80\\x99 joke. But it had\\r\\nbecome quite a different matter with Aglaya. All the affectation of\\r\\nmanner which she had displayed at the beginning disappeared as the\\r\\nballad proceeded. She spoke the lines in so serious and exalted a\\r\\nmanner, and with so much taste, that she even seemed to justify the\\r\\nexaggerated solemnity with which she had stepped forward. It was\\r\\nimpossible to discern in her now anything but a deep feeling for the\\r\\nspirit of the poem which she had undertaken to interpret.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer eyes were aglow with inspiration, and a slight tremor of rapture\\r\\npassed over her lovely features once or twice. She continued to recite:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOnce there came a vision glorious,\\r\\nMystic, dreadful, wondrous fair;\\r\\nBurned itself into his spirit,\\r\\nAnd abode for ever there!\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNever moreâ\\x80\\x94from that sweet momentâ\\x80\\x94\\r\\nGazÃ©d he on womankind;\\r\\nHe was dumb to love and wooing\\r\\nAnd to all their graces blind.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFull of love for that sweet vision,\\r\\nBrave and pure he took the field;\\r\\nWith his blood he stained the letters\\r\\nN. P. B. upon his shield.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Lumen caeli, sancta Rosa!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nShouting on the foe he fell,\\r\\nAnd like thunder rang his war-cry\\r\\nOâ\\x80\\x99er the cowering infidel.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen within his distant castle,\\r\\nHome returned, he dreamed his daysâ\\x80\\x94\\r\\nSilent, sad,â\\x80\\x94and when death took him\\r\\nHe was mad, the legend says.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen recalling all this afterwards the prince could not for the life of\\r\\nhim understand how to reconcile the beautiful, sincere, pure nature of\\r\\nthe girl with the irony of this jest. That it was a jest there was no\\r\\ndoubt whatever; he knew that well enough, and had good reason, too, for\\r\\nhis conviction; for during her recitation of the ballad Aglaya had\\r\\ndeliberately changed the letters A. N. B. into N. P. B. He was quite\\r\\nsure she had not done this by accident, and that his ears had not\\r\\ndeceived him. At all events her performanceâ\\x80\\x94which was a joke, of\\r\\ncourse, if rather a crude one,â\\x80\\x94was premeditated. They had evidently\\r\\ntalked (and laughed) over the â\\x80\\x98poor knightâ\\x80\\x99 for more than a month.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet Aglaya had brought out these letters N. P. B. not only without the\\r\\nslightest appearance of irony, or even any particular accentuation, but\\r\\nwith so even and unbroken an appearance of seriousness that assuredly\\r\\nanyone might have supposed that these initials were the original ones\\r\\nwritten in the ballad. The thing made an uncomfortable impression upon\\r\\nthe prince. Of course Mrs. Epanchin saw nothing either in the change of\\r\\ninitials or in the insinuation embodied therein. General Epanchin only\\r\\nknew that there was a recitation of verses going on, and took no\\r\\nfurther interest in the matter. Of the rest of the audience, many had\\r\\nunderstood the allusion and wondered both at the daring of the lady and\\r\\nat the motive underlying it, but tried to show no sign of their\\r\\nfeelings. But Evgenie Pavlovitch (as the prince was ready to wager)\\r\\nboth comprehended and tried his best to show that he comprehended; his\\r\\nsmile was too mocking to leave any doubt on that point.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow beautiful that is!â\\x80\\x9d cried Mrs. Epanchin, with sincere admiration.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhose is it?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPushkinâ\\x80\\x99s, mama, of course! Donâ\\x80\\x99t disgrace us all by showing your\\r\\nignorance,â\\x80\\x9d said Adelaida.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAs soon as we reach home give it to me to read.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t think we have a copy of Pushkin in the house.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere are a couple of torn volumes somewhere; they have been lying\\r\\nabout from time immemorial,â\\x80\\x9d added Alexandra.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSend Feodor or Alexey up by the very first train to buy a copy,\\r\\nthen.â\\x80\\x94Aglaya, come hereâ\\x80\\x94kiss me, dear, you recited beautifully! but,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nshe added in a whisper, â\\x80\\x9cif you were sincere I am sorry for you. If it\\r\\nwas a joke, I do not approve of the feelings which prompted you to do\\r\\nit, and in any case you would have done far better not to recite it at\\r\\nall. Do you understand?â\\x80\\x94Now come along, young woman; weâ\\x80\\x99ve sat here too\\r\\nlong. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll speak to you about this another time.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile the prince took the opportunity of greeting General Epanchin,\\r\\nand the general introduced Evgenie Pavlovitch to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI caught him up on the way to your house,â\\x80\\x9d explained the general. â\\x80\\x9cHe\\r\\nhad heard that we were all here.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, and I heard that you were here, too,â\\x80\\x9d added Evgenie Pavlovitch;\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand since I had long promised myself the pleasure of seeking not only\\r\\nyour acquaintance but your friendship, I did not wish to waste time,\\r\\nbut came straight on. I am sorry to hear that you are unwell.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, but Iâ\\x80\\x99m quite well now, thank you, and very glad to make your\\r\\nacquaintance. Prince S. has often spoken to me about you,â\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nMuishkin, and for an instant the two men looked intently into one\\r\\nanotherâ\\x80\\x99s eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince remarked that Evgenie Pavlovitchâ\\x80\\x99s plain clothes had\\r\\nevidently made a great impression upon the company present, so much so\\r\\nthat all other interests seemed to be effaced before this surprising\\r\\nfact.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis change of dress was evidently a matter of some importance. Adelaida\\r\\nand Alexandra poured out a stream of questions; Prince S., a relative\\r\\nof the young man, appeared annoyed; and Ivan Fedorovitch quite excited.\\r\\nAglaya alone was not interested. She merely looked closely at Evgenie\\r\\nfor a minute, curious perhaps as to whether civil or military clothes\\r\\nbecame him best, then turned away and paid no more attention to him or\\r\\nhis costume. Lizabetha Prokofievna asked no questions, but it was clear\\r\\nthat she was uneasy, and the prince fancied that Evgenie was not in her\\r\\ngood graces.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe has astonished me,â\\x80\\x9d said Ivan Fedorovitch. â\\x80\\x9cI nearly fell down with\\r\\nsurprise. I could hardly believe my eyes when I met him in Petersburg\\r\\njust now. Why this haste? Thatâ\\x80\\x99s what I want to know. He has always\\r\\nsaid himself that there is no need to break windows.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEvgenie Pavlovitch remarked here that he had spoken of his intention of\\r\\nleaving the service long ago. He had, however, always made more or less\\r\\nof a joke about it, so no one had taken him seriously. For that matter\\r\\nhe joked about everything, and his friends never knew what to believe,\\r\\nespecially if he did not wish them to understand him.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have only retired for a time,â\\x80\\x9d said he, laughing. â\\x80\\x9cFor a few months;\\r\\nat most for a year.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut there is no necessity for you to retire at all,â\\x80\\x9d complained the\\r\\ngeneral, â\\x80\\x9cas far as I know.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI want to go and look after my country estates. You advised me to do\\r\\nthat yourself,â\\x80\\x9d was the reply. â\\x80\\x9cAnd then I wish to go abroad.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a few more expostulations, the conversation drifted into other\\r\\nchannels, but the prince, who had been an attentive listener, thought\\r\\nall this excitement about so small a matter very curious. â\\x80\\x9cThere must\\r\\nbe more in it than appears,â\\x80\\x9d he said to himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI see the â\\x80\\x98poor knightâ\\x80\\x99 has come on the scene again,â\\x80\\x9d said Evgenie\\r\\nPavlovitch, stepping to Aglayaâ\\x80\\x99s side.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the amazement of the prince, who overheard the remark, Aglaya looked\\r\\nhaughtily and inquiringly at the questioner, as though she would give\\r\\nhim to know, once for all, that there could be no talk between them\\r\\nabout the â\\x80\\x98poor knight,â\\x80\\x99 and that she did not understand his question.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut not now! It is too late to send to town for a Pushkin now. It is\\r\\nmuch too late, I say!â\\x80\\x9d Colia was exclaiming in a loud voice. â\\x80\\x9cI have\\r\\ntold you so at least a hundred times.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, it is really much too late to send to town now,â\\x80\\x9d said Evgenie\\r\\nPavlovitch, who had escaped from Aglaya as rapidly as possible. â\\x80\\x9cI am\\r\\nsure the shops are shut in Petersburg; it is past eight oâ\\x80\\x99clock,â\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nadded, looking at his watch.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe have done without him so far,â\\x80\\x9d interrupted Adelaida in her turn.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSurely we can wait until to-morrow.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBesides,â\\x80\\x9d said Colia, â\\x80\\x9cit is quite unusual, almost improper, for\\r\\npeople in our position to take any interest in literature. Ask Evgenie\\r\\nPavlovitch if I am not right. It is much more fashionable to drive a\\r\\nwaggonette with red wheels.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou got that from some magazine, Colia,â\\x80\\x9d remarked Adelaida.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe gets most of his conversation in that way,â\\x80\\x9d laughed Evgenie\\r\\nPavlovitch. â\\x80\\x9cHe borrows whole phrases from the reviews. I have long had\\r\\nthe pleasure of knowing both Nicholai Ardalionovitch and his\\r\\nconversational methods, but this time he was not repeating something he\\r\\nhad read; he was alluding, no doubt, to my yellow waggonette, which\\r\\nhas, or had, red wheels. But I have exchanged it, so you are rather\\r\\nbehind the times, Colia.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince had been listening attentively to Radomskiâ\\x80\\x99s words, and\\r\\nthought his manner very pleasant. When Colia chaffed him about his\\r\\nwaggonette he had replied with perfect equality and in a friendly\\r\\nfashion. This pleased Muishkin.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this moment Vera came up to Lizabetha Prokofievna, carrying several\\r\\nlarge and beautifully bound books, apparently quite new.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat is it?â\\x80\\x9d demanded the lady.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis is Pushkin,â\\x80\\x9d replied the girl. â\\x80\\x9cPapa told me to offer it to you.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat? Impossible!â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Mrs. Epanchin.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot as a present, not as a present! I should not have taken the\\r\\nliberty,â\\x80\\x9d said Lebedeff, appearing suddenly from behind his daughter.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is our own Pushkin, our family copy, Annenkoffâ\\x80\\x99s edition; it could\\r\\nnot be bought now. I beg to suggest, with great respect, that your\\r\\nexcellency should buy it, and thus quench the noble literary thirst\\r\\nwhich is consuming you at this moment,â\\x80\\x9d he concluded grandiloquently.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh! if you will sell it, very goodâ\\x80\\x94and thank you. You shall not be a\\r\\nloser! But for goodnessâ\\x80\\x99 sake, donâ\\x80\\x99t twist about like that, sir! I have\\r\\nheard of you; they tell me you are a very learned person. We must have\\r\\na talk one of these days. You will bring me the books yourself?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWith the greatest respect... and... and veneration,â\\x80\\x9d replied Lebedeff,\\r\\nmaking extraordinary grimaces.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, bring them, with or without respect, provided always you do not\\r\\ndrop them on the way; but on the condition,â\\x80\\x9d went on the lady, looking\\r\\nfull at him, â\\x80\\x9cthat you do not cross my threshold. I do not intend to\\r\\nreceive you today. You may send your daughter Vera at once, if you\\r\\nlike. I am much pleased with her.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy donâ\\x80\\x99t you tell him about them?â\\x80\\x9d said Vera impatiently to her\\r\\nfather. â\\x80\\x9cThey will come in, whether you announce them or not, and they\\r\\nare beginning to make a row. Lef Nicolaievitch,â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94she addressed herself\\r\\nto the princeâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cfour men are here asking for you. They have waited some\\r\\ntime, and are beginning to make a fuss, and papa will not bring them\\r\\nin.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWho are these people?â\\x80\\x9d said the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey say that they have come on business, and they are the kind of\\r\\nmen, who, if you do not see them here, will follow you about the\\r\\nstreet. It would be better to receive them, and then you will get rid\\r\\nof them. Gavrila Ardalionovitch and Ptitsin are both there, trying to\\r\\nmake them hear reason.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPavlicheffâ\\x80\\x99s son! It is not worth while!â\\x80\\x9d cried Lebedeff. â\\x80\\x9cThere is no\\r\\nnecessity to see them, and it would be most unpleasant for your\\r\\nexcellency. They do not deserve...â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat? Pavlicheffâ\\x80\\x99s son!â\\x80\\x9d cried the prince, much perturbed. â\\x80\\x9cI know...\\r\\nI knowâ\\x80\\x94but I entrusted this matter to Gavrila Ardalionovitch. He told\\r\\nme...â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment Gania, accompanied by Ptitsin, came out to the terrace.\\r\\nFrom an adjoining room came a noise of angry voices, and General\\r\\nIvolgin, in loud tones, seemed to be trying to shout them down. Colia\\r\\nrushed off at once to investigate the cause of the uproar.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis is most interesting!â\\x80\\x9d observed Evgenie Pavlovitch.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI expect he knows all about it!â\\x80\\x9d thought the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat, the son of Pavlicheff? And who may this son of Pavlicheff be?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nasked General Epanchin with surprise; and looking curiously around him,\\r\\nhe discovered that he alone had no clue to the mystery. Expectation and\\r\\nsuspense were on every face, with the exception of that of the prince,\\r\\nwho stood gravely wondering how an affair so entirely personal could\\r\\nhave awakened such lively and widespread interest in so short a time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAglaya went up to him with a peculiarly serious look.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt will be well,â\\x80\\x9d she said, â\\x80\\x9cif you put an end to this affair yourself\\r\\n_at once_: but you must allow us to be your witnesses. They want to\\r\\nthrow mud at you, prince, and you must be triumphantly vindicated. I\\r\\ngive you joy beforehand!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd I also wish for justice to be done, once for all,â\\x80\\x9d cried Madame\\r\\nEpanchin, â\\x80\\x9cabout this impudent claim. Deal with them promptly, prince,\\r\\nand donâ\\x80\\x99t spare them! I am sick of hearing about the affair, and many a\\r\\nquarrel I have had in your cause. But I confess I am anxious to see\\r\\nwhat happens, so do make them come out here, and we will remain. You\\r\\nhave heard people talking about it, no doubt?â\\x80\\x9d she added, turning to\\r\\nPrince S.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course,â\\x80\\x9d said he. â\\x80\\x9cI have heard it spoken about at your house, and\\r\\nI am anxious to see these young men!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey are Nihilists, are they not?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, they are not Nihilists,â\\x80\\x9d explained Lebedeff, who seemed much\\r\\nexcited. â\\x80\\x9cThis is another lotâ\\x80\\x94a special group. According to my nephew\\r\\nthey are more advanced even than the Nihilists. You are quite wrong,\\r\\nexcellency, if you think that your presence will intimidate them;\\r\\nnothing intimidates them. Educated men, learned men even, are to be\\r\\nfound among Nihilists; these go further, in that they are men of\\r\\naction. The movement is, properly speaking, a derivative from\\r\\nNihilismâ\\x80\\x94though they are only known indirectly, and by hearsay, for\\r\\nthey never advertise their doings in the papers. They go straight to\\r\\nthe point. For them, it is not a question of showing that Pushkin is\\r\\nstupid, or that Russia must be torn in pieces. No; but if they have a\\r\\ngreat desire for anything, they believe they have a right to get it\\r\\neven at the cost of the lives, say, of eight persons. They are checked\\r\\nby no obstacles. In fact, prince, I should not advise you...â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Muishkin had risen, and was on his way to open the door for his\\r\\nvisitors.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are slandering them, Lebedeff,â\\x80\\x9d said he, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are always thinking about your nephewâ\\x80\\x99s conduct. Donâ\\x80\\x99t believe\\r\\nhim, Lizabetha Prokofievna. I can assure you Gorsky and Daniloff are\\r\\nexceptionsâ\\x80\\x94and that these are only... mistaken. However, I do not care\\r\\nabout receiving them here, in public. Excuse me, Lizabetha Prokofievna.\\r\\nThey are coming, and you can see them, and then I will take them away.\\r\\nPlease come in, gentlemen!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother thought tormented him: He wondered was this an arranged\\r\\nbusinessâ\\x80\\x94arranged to happen when he had guests in his house, and in\\r\\nanticipation of his humiliation rather than of his triumph? But he\\r\\nreproached himself bitterly for such a thought, and felt as if he\\r\\nshould die of shame if it were discovered. When his new visitors\\r\\nappeared, he was quite ready to believe himself infinitely less to be\\r\\nrespected than any of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nFour persons entered, led by General Ivolgin, in a state of great\\r\\nexcitement, and talking eloquently.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe is for me, undoubtedly!â\\x80\\x9d thought the prince, with a smile. Colia\\r\\nalso had joined the party, and was talking with animation to Hippolyte,\\r\\nwho listened with a jeering smile on his lips.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince begged the visitors to sit down. They were all so young that\\r\\nit made the proceedings seem even more extraordinary. Ivan Fedorovitch,\\r\\nwho really understood nothing of what was going on, felt indignant at\\r\\nthe sight of these youths, and would have interfered in some way had it\\r\\nnot been for the extreme interest shown by his wife in the affair. He\\r\\ntherefore remained, partly through curiosity, partly through\\r\\ngood-nature, hoping that his presence might be of some use. But the bow\\r\\nwith which General Ivolgin greeted him irritated him anew; he frowned,\\r\\nand decided to be absolutely silent.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to the rest, one was a man of thirty, the retired officer, now a\\r\\nboxer, who had been with Rogojin, and in his happier days had given\\r\\nfifteen roubles at a time to beggars. Evidently he had joined the\\r\\nothers as a comrade to give them moral, and if necessary material,\\r\\nsupport. The man who had been spoken of as â\\x80\\x9cPavlicheffâ\\x80\\x99s son,â\\x80\\x9d although\\r\\nhe gave the name of Antip Burdovsky, was about twenty-two years of age,\\r\\nfair, thin and rather tall. He was remarkable for the poverty, not to\\r\\nsay uncleanliness, of his personal appearance: the sleeves of his\\r\\novercoat were greasy; his dirty waistcoat, buttoned up to his neck,\\r\\nshowed not a trace of linen; a filthy black silk scarf, twisted till it\\r\\nresembled a cord, was round his neck, and his hands were unwashed. He\\r\\nlooked round with an air of insolent effrontery. His face, covered with\\r\\npimples, was neither thoughtful nor even contemptuous; it wore an\\r\\nexpression of complacent satisfaction in demanding his rights and in\\r\\nbeing an aggrieved party. His voice trembled, and he spoke so fast, and\\r\\nwith such stammerings, that he might have been taken for a foreigner,\\r\\nthough the purest Russian blood ran in his veins. Lebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s nephew,\\r\\nwhom the reader has seen already, accompanied him, and also the youth\\r\\nnamed Hippolyte Terentieff. The latter was only seventeen or eighteen.\\r\\nHe had an intelligent face, though it was usually irritated and fretful\\r\\nin expression. His skeleton-like figure, his ghastly complexion, the\\r\\nbrightness of his eyes, and the red spots of colour on his cheeks,\\r\\nbetrayed the victim of consumption to the most casual glance. He\\r\\ncoughed persistently, and panted for breath; it looked as though he had\\r\\nbut a few weeks more to live. He was nearly dead with fatigue, and\\r\\nfell, rather than sat, into a chair. The rest bowed as they came in;\\r\\nand being more or less abashed, put on an air of extreme\\r\\nself-assurance. In short, their attitude was not that which one would\\r\\nhave expected in men who professed to despise all trivialities, all\\r\\nfoolish mundane conventions, and indeed everything, except their own\\r\\npersonal interests.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAntip Burdovsky,â\\x80\\x9d stuttered the son of Pavlicheff.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVladimir Doktorenko,â\\x80\\x9d said Lebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s nephew briskly, and with a\\r\\ncertain pride, as if he boasted of his name.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cKeller,â\\x80\\x9d murmured the retired officer.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHippolyte Terentieff,â\\x80\\x9d cried the last-named, in a shrill voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey sat now in a row facing the prince, and frowned, and played with\\r\\ntheir caps. All appeared ready to speak, and yet all were silent; the\\r\\ndefiant expression on their faces seemed to say, â\\x80\\x9cNo, sir, you donâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\ntake us in!â\\x80\\x9d It could be felt that the first word spoken by anyone\\r\\npresent would bring a torrent of speech from the whole deputation.\\r\\n\\r\\nVIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI _did_ not expect you, gentlemen,â\\x80\\x9d began the prince. â\\x80\\x9cI have been ill\\r\\nuntil to-day. A month ago,â\\x80\\x9d he continued, addressing himself to Antip\\r\\nBurdovsky, â\\x80\\x9cI put your business into Gavrila Ardalionovitch Ivolginâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nhands, as I told you then. I do not in the least object to having a\\r\\npersonal interview... but you will agree with me that this is hardly\\r\\nthe time... I propose that we go into another room, if you will not\\r\\nkeep me long... As you see, I have friends here, and believe me...â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFriends as many as you please, but allow me,â\\x80\\x9d interrupted the harsh\\r\\nvoice of Lebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s nephewâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9callow me to tell you that you might have\\r\\ntreated us rather more politely, and not have kept us waiting at least\\r\\ntwo hours...\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo doubt... and I... is that acting like a prince? And you... you may\\r\\nbe a general! But I... I am not your valet! And I... I...â\\x80\\x9d stammered\\r\\nAntip Burdovsky.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was extremely excited; his lips trembled, and the resentment of an\\r\\nembittered soul was in his voice. But he spoke so indistinctly that\\r\\nhardly a dozen words could be gathered.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was a princely action!â\\x80\\x9d sneered Hippolyte.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf anyone had treated me so,â\\x80\\x9d grumbled the boxer.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI mean to say that if I had been in Burdovskyâ\\x80\\x99s place...I...â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGentlemen, I did not know you were there; I have only just been\\r\\ninformed, I assure you,â\\x80\\x9d repeated Muishkin.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe are not afraid of your friends, prince,â\\x80\\x9d remarked Lebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nnephew, â\\x80\\x9cfor we are within our rights.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shrill tones of Hippolyte interrupted him. â\\x80\\x9cWhat right have you...\\r\\nby what right do you demand us to submit this matter, about\\r\\nBurdovsky... to the judgment of your friends? We know only too well\\r\\nwhat the judgment of your friends will be!...â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis beginning gave promise of a stormy discussion. The prince was much\\r\\ndiscouraged, but at last he managed to make himself heard amid the\\r\\nvociferations of his excited visitors.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf you,â\\x80\\x9d he said, addressing Burdovskyâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cif you prefer not to speak\\r\\nhere, I offer again to go into another room with you... and as to your\\r\\nwaiting to see me, I repeat that I only this instant heard...â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, you have no right, you have no right, no right at all!... Your\\r\\nfriends indeed!â\\x80\\x9d... gabbled Burdovsky, defiantly examining the faces\\r\\nround him, and becoming more and more excited. â\\x80\\x9cYou have no right!...â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nAs he ended thus abruptly, he leant forward, staring at the prince with\\r\\nhis short-sighted, bloodshot eyes. The latter was so astonished, that\\r\\nhe did not reply, but looked steadily at him in return.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLef Nicolaievitch!â\\x80\\x9d interposed Madame Epanchin, suddenly, â\\x80\\x9cread this\\r\\nat once, this very moment! It is about this business.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe held out a weekly comic paper, pointing to an article on one of its\\r\\npages. Just as the visitors were coming in, Lebedeff, wishing to\\r\\ningratiate himself with the great lady, had pulled this paper from his\\r\\npocket, and presented it to her, indicating a few columns marked in\\r\\npencil. Lizabetha Prokofievna had had time to read some of it, and was\\r\\ngreatly upset.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWould it not be better to peruse it alone... later,â\\x80\\x9d asked the prince,\\r\\nnervously.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, no, read itâ\\x80\\x94read it at once directly, and aloud, aloud!â\\x80\\x9d cried\\r\\nshe, calling Colia to her and giving him the journal.â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cRead it aloud,\\r\\nso that everyone may hear it!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAn impetuous woman, Lizabetha Prokofievna sometimes weighed her anchors\\r\\nand put out to sea quite regardless of the possible storms she might\\r\\nencounter. Ivan Fedorovitch felt a sudden pang of alarm, but the others\\r\\nwere merely curious, and somewhat surprised. Colia unfolded the paper,\\r\\nand began to read, in his clear, high-pitched voice, the following\\r\\narticle:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cProletarians and scions of nobility! An episode of the brigandage of\\r\\ntoday and every day! Progress! Reform! Justice!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cStrange things are going on in our so-called Holy Russia in this age\\r\\nof reform and great enterprises; this age of patriotism in which\\r\\nhundreds of millions are yearly sent abroad; in which industry is\\r\\nencouraged, and the hands of Labour paralyzed, etc.; there is no end to\\r\\nthis, gentlemen, so let us come to the point. A strange thing has\\r\\nhappened to a scion of our defunct aristocracy. (_De profundis!_) The\\r\\ngrandfathers of these scions ruined themselves at the gaming-tables;\\r\\ntheir fathers were forced to serve as officers or subalterns; some have\\r\\ndied just as they were about to be tried for innocent thoughtlessness\\r\\nin the handling of public funds. Their children are sometimes\\r\\ncongenital idiots, like the hero of our story; sometimes they are found\\r\\nin the dock at the Assizes, where they are generally acquitted by the\\r\\njury for edifying motives; sometimes they distinguish themselves by one\\r\\nof those burning scandals that amaze the public and add another blot to\\r\\nthe stained record of our age. Six months agoâ\\x80\\x94that is, last winterâ\\x80\\x94this\\r\\nparticular scion returned to Russia, wearing gaiters like a foreigner,\\r\\nand shivering with cold in an old scantily-lined cloak. He had come\\r\\nfrom Switzerland, where he had just undergone a successful course of\\r\\ntreatment for idiocy (_sic!_). Certainly Fortune favoured him, for,\\r\\napart from the interesting malady of which he was cured in Switzerland\\r\\n(can there be a cure for idiocy?) his story proves the truth of the\\r\\nRussian proverb that â\\x80\\x98happiness is the right of certain classes!â\\x80\\x99 Judge\\r\\nfor yourselves. Our subject was an infant in arms when he lost his\\r\\nfather, an officer who died just as he was about to be court-martialled\\r\\nfor gambling away the funds of his company, and perhaps also for\\r\\nflogging a subordinate to excess (remember the good old days,\\r\\ngentlemen). The orphan was brought up by the charity of a very rich\\r\\nRussian landowner. In the good old days, this man, whom we will call\\r\\nPâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94, owned four thousand souls as serfs (souls as serfs!â\\x80\\x94can you\\r\\nunderstand such an expression, gentlemen? I cannot; it must be looked\\r\\nup in a dictionary before one can understand it; these things of a\\r\\nbygone day are already unintelligible to us). He appears to have been\\r\\none of those Russian parasites who lead an idle existence abroad,\\r\\nspending the summer at some spa, and the winter in Paris, to the\\r\\ngreater profit of the organizers of public balls. It may safely be said\\r\\nthat the manager of the Chateau des Fleurs (lucky man!) pocketed at\\r\\nleast a third of the money paid by Russian peasants to their lords in\\r\\nthe days of serfdom. However this may be, the gay Pâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94 brought up the\\r\\norphan like a prince, provided him with tutors and governesses (pretty,\\r\\nof course!) whom he chose himself in Paris. But the little aristocrat,\\r\\nthe last of his noble race, was an idiot. The governesses, recruited at\\r\\nthe Chateau des Fleurs, laboured in vain; at twenty years of age their\\r\\npupil could not speak in any language, not even Russian. But ignorance\\r\\nof the latter was still excusable. At last Pâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94 was seized with a\\r\\nstrange notion; he imagined that in Switzerland they could change an\\r\\nidiot into a man of sense. After all, the idea was quite logical; a\\r\\nparasite and landowner naturally supposed that intelligence was a\\r\\nmarketable commodity like everything else, and that in Switzerland\\r\\nespecially it could be bought for money. The case was entrusted to a\\r\\ncelebrated Swiss professor, and cost thousands of roubles; the\\r\\ntreatment lasted five years. Needless to say, the idiot did not become\\r\\nintelligent, but it is alleged that he grew into something more or less\\r\\nresembling a man. At this stage Pâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94 died suddenly, and, as usual, he\\r\\nhad made no will and left his affairs in disorder. A crowd of eager\\r\\nclaimants arose, who cared nothing about any last scion of a noble race\\r\\nundergoing treatment in Switzerland, at the expense of the deceased, as\\r\\na congenital idiot. Idiot though he was, the noble scion tried to cheat\\r\\nhis professor, and they say he succeeded in getting him to continue the\\r\\ntreatment gratis for two years, by concealing the death of his\\r\\nbenefactor. But the professor himself was a charlatan. Getting anxious\\r\\nat last when no money was forthcoming, and alarmed above all by his\\r\\npatientâ\\x80\\x99s appetite, he presented him with a pair of old gaiters and a\\r\\nshabby cloak and packed him off to Russia, third class. It would seem\\r\\nthat Fortune had turned her back upon our hero. Not at all; Fortune,\\r\\nwho lets whole populations die of hunger, showered all her gifts at\\r\\nonce upon the little aristocrat, like Kryloffâ\\x80\\x99s Cloud which passes over\\r\\nan arid plain and empties itself into the sea. He had scarcely arrived\\r\\nin St. Petersburg, when a relation of his motherâ\\x80\\x99s (who was of\\r\\nbourgeois origin, of course), died at Moscow. He was a merchant, an Old\\r\\nBeliever, and he had no children. He left a fortune of several millions\\r\\nin good current coin, and everything came to our noble scion, our\\r\\ngaitered baron, formerly treated for idiocy in a Swiss lunatic asylum.\\r\\nInstantly the scene changed, crowds of friends gathered round our\\r\\nbaron, who meanwhile had lost his head over a celebrated demi-mondaine;\\r\\nhe even discovered some relations; moreover a number of young girls of\\r\\nhigh birth burned to be united to him in lawful matrimony. Could anyone\\r\\npossibly imagine a better match? Aristocrat, millionaire, and idiot, he\\r\\nhas every advantage! One might hunt in vain for his equal, even with\\r\\nthe lantern of Diogenes; his like is not to be had even by getting it\\r\\nmade to order!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, I donâ\\x80\\x99t know what this meansâ\\x80\\x9d cried Ivan Fedorovitch, transported\\r\\nwith indignation.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLeave off, Colia,â\\x80\\x9d begged the prince. Exclamations arose on all sides.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLet him go on reading at all costs!â\\x80\\x9d ordered Lizabetha Prokofievna,\\r\\nevidently preserving her composure by a desperate effort. â\\x80\\x9cPrince, if\\r\\nthe reading is stopped, you and I will quarrel.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nColia had no choice but to obey. With crimson cheeks he read on\\r\\nunsteadily:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut while our young millionaire dwelt as it were in the Empyrean,\\r\\nsomething new occurred. One fine morning a man called upon him, calm\\r\\nand severe of aspect, distinguished, but plainly dressed. Politely, but\\r\\nin dignified terms, as befitted his errand, he briefly explained the\\r\\nmotive for his visit. He was a lawyer of enlightened views; his client\\r\\nwas a young man who had consulted him in confidence. This young man was\\r\\nno other than the son of Pâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94, though he bears another name. In his\\r\\nyouth Pâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94, the sensualist, had seduced a young girl, poor but\\r\\nrespectable. She was a serf, but had received a European education.\\r\\nFinding that a child was expected, he hastened her marriage with a man\\r\\nof noble character who had loved her for a long time. He helped the\\r\\nyoung couple for a time, but he was soon obliged to give up, for the\\r\\nhigh-minded husband refused to accept anything from him. Soon the\\r\\ncareless nobleman forgot all about his former mistress and the child\\r\\nshe had borne him; then, as we know, he died intestate. Pâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x99s son, born\\r\\nafter his motherâ\\x80\\x99s marriage, found a true father in the generous man\\r\\nwhose name he bore. But when he also died, the orphan was left to\\r\\nprovide for himself, his mother now being an invalid who had lost the\\r\\nuse of her limbs. Leaving her in a distant province, he came to the\\r\\ncapital in search of pupils. By dint of daily toil he earned enough to\\r\\nenable him to follow the college courses, and at last to enter the\\r\\nuniversity. But what can one earn by teaching the children of Russian\\r\\nmerchants at ten copecks a lesson, especially with an invalid mother to\\r\\nkeep? Even her death did not much diminish the hardships of the young\\r\\nmanâ\\x80\\x99s struggle for existence. Now this is the question: how, in the\\r\\nname of justice, should our scion have argued the case? Our readers\\r\\nwill think, no doubt, that he would say to himself: â\\x80\\x98Pâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94 showered\\r\\nbenefits upon me all my life; he spent tens of thousands of roubles to\\r\\neducate me, to provide me with governesses, and to keep me under\\r\\ntreatment in Switzerland. Now I am a millionaire, and Pâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x99s son, a\\r\\nnoble young man who is not responsible for the faults of his careless\\r\\nand forgetful father, is wearing himself out giving ill-paid lessons.\\r\\nAccording to justice, all that was done for me ought to have been done\\r\\nfor him. The enormous sums spent upon me were not really mine; they\\r\\ncame to me by an error of blind Fortune, when they ought to have gone\\r\\nto Pâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x99s son. They should have gone to benefit him, not me, in whom Pâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94\\r\\ninterested himself by a mere caprice, instead of doing his duty as a\\r\\nfather. If I wished to behave nobly, justly, and with delicacy, I ought\\r\\nto bestow half my fortune upon the son of my benefactor; but as economy\\r\\nis my favourite virtue, and I know this is not a case in which the law\\r\\ncan intervene, I will not give up half my millions. But it would be too\\r\\nopenly vile, too flagrantly infamous, if I did not at least restore to\\r\\nPâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x99s son the tens of thousands of roubles spent in curing my idiocy.\\r\\nThis is simply a case of conscience and of strict justice. Whatever\\r\\nwould have become of me if Pâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94 had not looked after my education, and\\r\\nhad taken care of his own son instead of me?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, gentlemen, our scions of the nobility do not reason thus. The\\r\\nlawyer, who had taken up the matter purely out of friendship to the\\r\\nyoung man, and almost against his will, invoked every consideration of\\r\\njustice, delicacy, honour, and even plain figures; in vain, the\\r\\nex-patient of the Swiss lunatic asylum was inflexible. All this might\\r\\npass, but the sequel is absolutely unpardonable, and not to be excused\\r\\nby any interesting malady. This millionaire, having but just discarded\\r\\nthe old gaiters of his professor, could not even understand that the\\r\\nnoble young man slaving away at his lessons was not asking for\\r\\ncharitable help, but for his rightful due, though the debt was not a\\r\\nlegal one; that, correctly speaking, he was not asking for anything,\\r\\nbut it was merely his friends who had thought fit to bestir themselves\\r\\non his behalf. With the cool insolence of a bloated capitalist, secure\\r\\nin his millions, he majestically drew a banknote for fifty roubles from\\r\\nhis pocket-book and sent it to the noble young man as a humiliating\\r\\npiece of charity. You can hardly believe it, gentlemen! You are\\r\\nscandalized and disgusted; you cry out in indignation! But that is what\\r\\nhe did! Needless to say, the money was returned, or rather flung back\\r\\nin his face. The case is not within the province of the law, it must be\\r\\nreferred to the tribunal of public opinion; this is what we now do,\\r\\nguaranteeing the truth of all the details which we have related.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Colia had finished reading, he handed the paper to the prince, and\\r\\nretired silently to a corner of the room, hiding his face in his hands.\\r\\nHe was overcome by a feeling of inexpressible shame; his boyish\\r\\nsensitiveness was wounded beyond endurance. It seemed to him that\\r\\nsomething extraordinary, some sudden catastrophe had occurred, and that\\r\\nhe was almost the cause of it, because he had read the article aloud.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet all the others were similarly affected. The girls were\\r\\nuncomfortable and ashamed. Lizabetha Prokofievna restrained her violent\\r\\nanger by a great effort; perhaps she bitterly regretted her\\r\\ninterference in the matter; for the present she kept silence. The\\r\\nprince felt as very shy people often do in such a case; he was so\\r\\nashamed of the conduct of other people, so humiliated for his guests,\\r\\nthat he dared not look them in the face. Ptitsin, Varia, Gania, and\\r\\nLebedeff himself, all looked rather confused. Stranger still, Hippolyte\\r\\nand the â\\x80\\x9cson of Pavlicheffâ\\x80\\x9d also seemed slightly surprised, and\\r\\nLebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s nephew was obviously far from pleased. The boxer alone was\\r\\nperfectly calm; he twisted his moustaches with affected dignity, and if\\r\\nhis eyes were cast down it was certainly not in confusion, but rather\\r\\nin noble modesty, as if he did not wish to be insolent in his triumph.\\r\\nIt was evident that he was delighted with the article.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe devil knows what it means,â\\x80\\x9d growled Ivan Fedorovitch, under his\\r\\nbreath; â\\x80\\x9cit must have taken the united wits of fifty footmen to write\\r\\nit.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMay I ask your reason for such an insulting supposition, sir?â\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nHippolyte, trembling with rage.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou will admit yourself, general, that for an honourable man, if the\\r\\nauthor is an honourable man, that is anâ\\x80\\x94an insult,â\\x80\\x9d growled the boxer\\r\\nsuddenly, with convulsive jerkings of his shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn the first place, it is not for you to address me as â\\x80\\x98sir,â\\x80\\x99 and, in\\r\\nthe second place, I refuse to give you any explanation,â\\x80\\x9d said Ivan\\r\\nFedorovitch vehemently; and he rose without another word, and went and\\r\\nstood on the first step of the flight that led from the verandah to the\\r\\nstreet, turning his back on the company. He was indignant with\\r\\nLizabetha Prokofievna, who did not think of moving even now.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGentlemen, gentlemen, let me speak at last,â\\x80\\x9d cried the prince, anxious\\r\\nand agitated. â\\x80\\x9cPlease let us understand one another. I say nothing\\r\\nabout the article, gentlemen, except that every word is false; I say\\r\\nthis because you know it as well as I do. It is shameful. I should be\\r\\nsurprised if any one of you could have written it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI did not know of its existence till this moment,â\\x80\\x9d declared Hippolyte.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI do not approve of it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI knew it had been written, but I would not have advised its\\r\\npublication,â\\x80\\x9d said Lebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s nephew, â\\x80\\x9cbecause it is premature.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI knew it, but I have a right. I... I...â\\x80\\x9d stammered the â\\x80\\x9cson of\\r\\nPavlicheff.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat! Did you write all that yourself? Is it possible?â\\x80\\x9d asked the\\r\\nprince, regarding Burdovsky with curiosity.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOne might dispute your right to ask such questions,â\\x80\\x9d observed\\r\\nLebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s nephew.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was only surprised that Mr. Burdovsky should haveâ\\x80\\x94however, this is\\r\\nwhat I have to say. Since you had already given the matter publicity,\\r\\nwhy did you object just now, when I began to speak of it to my\\r\\nfriends?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAt last!â\\x80\\x9d murmured Lizabetha Prokofievna indignantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nLebedeff could restrain himself no longer; he made his way through the\\r\\nrow of chairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPrince,â\\x80\\x9d he cried, â\\x80\\x9cyou are forgetting that if you consented to\\r\\nreceive and hear them, it was only because of your kind heart which has\\r\\nno equal, for they had not the least right to demand it, especially as\\r\\nyou had placed the matter in the hands of Gavrila Ardalionovitch, which\\r\\nwas also extremely kind of you. You are also forgetting, most excellent\\r\\nprince, that you are with friends, a select company; you cannot\\r\\nsacrifice them to these gentlemen, and it is only for you to have them\\r\\nturned out this instant. As the master of the house I shall have great\\r\\npleasure ....â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuite right!â\\x80\\x9d agreed General Ivolgin in a loud voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat will do, Lebedeff, that will doâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d began the prince, when an\\r\\nindignant outcry drowned his words.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExcuse me, prince, excuse me, but now that will not do,â\\x80\\x9d shouted\\r\\nLebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s nephew, his voice dominating all the others. â\\x80\\x9cThe matter\\r\\nmust be clearly stated, for it is obviously not properly understood.\\r\\nThey are calling in some legal chicanery, and upon that ground they are\\r\\nthreatening to turn us out of the house! Really, prince, do you think\\r\\nwe are such fools as not to be aware that this matter does not come\\r\\nwithin the law, and that legally we cannot claim a rouble from you? But\\r\\nwe are also aware that if actual law is not on our side, human law is\\r\\nfor us, natural law, the law of common-sense and conscience, which is\\r\\nno less binding upon every noble and honest manâ\\x80\\x94that is, every man of\\r\\nsane judgmentâ\\x80\\x94because it is not to be found in miserable legal codes.\\r\\nIf we come here without fear of being turned out (as was threatened\\r\\njust now) because of the imperative tone of our demand, and the\\r\\nunseemliness of such a visit at this late hour (though it was not late\\r\\nwhen we arrived, we were kept waiting in your anteroom), if, I say, we\\r\\ncame in without fear, it is just because we expected to find you a man\\r\\nof sense; I mean, a man of honour and conscience. It is quite true that\\r\\nwe did not present ourselves humbly, like your flatterers and\\r\\nparasites, but holding up our heads as befits independent men. We\\r\\npresent no petition, but a proud and free demand (note it well, we do\\r\\nnot beseech, we demand!). We ask you fairly and squarely in a dignified\\r\\nmanner. Do you believe that in this affair of Burdovsky you have right\\r\\non your side? Do you admit that Pavlicheff overwhelmed you with\\r\\nbenefits, and perhaps saved your life? If you admit it (which we take\\r\\nfor granted), do you intend, now that you are a millionaire, and do you\\r\\nnot think it in conformity with justice, to indemnify Burdovsky? Yes or\\r\\nno? If it is yes, or, in other words, if you possess what you call\\r\\nhonour and conscience, and we more justly call common-sense, then\\r\\naccede to our demand, and the matter is at an end. Give us\\r\\nsatisfaction, without entreaties or thanks from us; do not expect\\r\\nthanks from us, for what you do will be done not for our sake, but for\\r\\nthe sake of justice. If you refuse to satisfy us, that is, if your\\r\\nanswer is no, we will go away at once, and there will be an end of the\\r\\nmatter. But we will tell you to your face before the present company\\r\\nthat you are a man of vulgar and undeveloped mind; we will openly deny\\r\\nyou the right to speak in future of your honour and conscience, for you\\r\\nhave not paid the fair price of such a right. I have no more to sayâ\\x80\\x94I\\r\\nhave put the question before you. Now turn us out if you dare. You can\\r\\ndo it; force is on your side. But remember that we do not beseech, we\\r\\ndemand! We do not beseech, we demand!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWith these last excited words, Lebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s nephew was silent.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe demand, we demand, we demand, we do not beseech,â\\x80\\x9d spluttered\\r\\nBurdovsky, red as a lobster.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe speech of Lebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s nephew caused a certain stir among the\\r\\ncompany; murmurs arose, though with the exception of Lebedeff, who was\\r\\nstill very much excited, everyone was careful not to interfere in the\\r\\nmatter. Strangely enough, Lebedeff, although on the princeâ\\x80\\x99s side,\\r\\nseemed quite proud of his nephewâ\\x80\\x99s eloquence. Gratified vanity was\\r\\nvisible in the glances he cast upon the assembled company.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn my opinion, Mr. Doktorenko,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, in rather a low\\r\\nvoice, â\\x80\\x9cyou are quite right in at least half of what you say. I would\\r\\ngo further and say that you are altogether right, and that I quite\\r\\nagree with you, if there were not something lacking in your speech. I\\r\\ncannot undertake to say precisely what it is, but you have certainly\\r\\nomitted something, and you cannot be quite just while there is\\r\\nsomething lacking. But let us put that aside and return to the point.\\r\\nTell me what induced you to publish this article. Every word of it is a\\r\\ncalumny, and I think, gentlemen, that you have been guilty of a mean\\r\\naction.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAllow meâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSirâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat? What? What?â\\x80\\x9d cried all the visitors at once, in violent\\r\\nagitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAs to the article,â\\x80\\x9d said Hippolyte in his croaking voice, â\\x80\\x9cI have told\\r\\nyou already that we none of us approve of it! There is the writer,â\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nadded, pointing to the boxer, who sat beside him. â\\x80\\x9cI quite admit that\\r\\nhe has written it in his old regimental manner, with an equal disregard\\r\\nfor style and decency. I know he is a cross between a fool and an\\r\\nadventurer; I make no bones about telling him so to his face every day.\\r\\nBut after all he is half justified; publicity is the lawful right of\\r\\nevery man; consequently, Burdovsky is not excepted. Let him answer for\\r\\nhis own blunders. As to the objection which I made just now in the name\\r\\nof all, to the presence of your friends, I think I ought to explain,\\r\\ngentlemen, that I only did so to assert our rights, though we really\\r\\nwished to have witnesses; we had agreed unanimously upon the point\\r\\nbefore we came in. We do not care who your witnesses may be, or whether\\r\\nthey are your friends or not. As they cannot fail to recognize\\r\\nBurdovskyâ\\x80\\x99s right (seeing that it is mathematically demonstrable), it\\r\\nis just as well that the witnesses should be your friends. The truth\\r\\nwill only be more plainly evident.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is quite true; we had agreed upon that point,â\\x80\\x9d said Lebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nnephew, in confirmation.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf that is the case, why did you begin by making such a fuss about\\r\\nit?â\\x80\\x9d asked the astonished prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boxer was dying to get in a few words; owing, no doubt, to the\\r\\npresence of the ladies, he was becoming quite jovial.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAs to the article, prince,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cI admit that I wrote it, in\\r\\nspite of the severe criticism of my poor friend, in whom I always\\r\\noverlook many things because of his unfortunate state of health. But I\\r\\nwrote and published it in the form of a letter, in the paper of a\\r\\nfriend. I showed it to no one but Burdovsky, and I did not read it all\\r\\nthrough, even to him. He immediately gave me permission to publish it,\\r\\nbut you will admit that I might have done so without his consent.\\r\\nPublicity is a noble, beneficent, and universal right. I hope, prince,\\r\\nthat you are too progressive to deny this?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI deny nothing, but you must confess that your articleâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs a bit thick, you mean? Well, in a way that is in the public\\r\\ninterest; you will admit that yourself, and after all one cannot\\r\\noverlook a blatant fact. So much the worse for the guilty parties, but\\r\\nthe public welfare must come before everything. As to certain\\r\\ninaccuracies and figures of speech, so to speak, you will also admit\\r\\nthat the motive, aim, and intention, are the chief thing. It is a\\r\\nquestion, above all, of making a wholesome example; the individual case\\r\\ncan be examined afterwards; and as to the styleâ\\x80\\x94well, the thing was\\r\\nmeant to be humorous, so to speak, and, after all, everybody writes\\r\\nlike that; you must admit it yourself! Ha, ha!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut, gentlemen, I assure you that you are quite astray,â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed the\\r\\nprince. â\\x80\\x9cYou have published this article upon the supposition that I\\r\\nwould never consent to satisfy Mr. Burdovsky. Acting on that\\r\\nconviction, you have tried to intimidate me by this publication and to\\r\\nbe revenged for my supposed refusal. But what did you know of my\\r\\nintentions? It may be that I have resolved to satisfy Mr. Burdovskyâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nclaim. I now declare openly, in the presence of these witnesses, that I\\r\\nwill do so.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe noble and intelligent word of an intelligent and most noble man,\\r\\nat last!â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed the boxer.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood God!â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Lizabetha Prokofievna involuntarily.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis is intolerable,â\\x80\\x9d growled the general.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAllow me, gentlemen, allow me,â\\x80\\x9d urged the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI will explain matters to you. Five weeks ago I received a visit from\\r\\nTchebaroff, your agent, Mr. Burdovsky. You have given a very flattering\\r\\ndescription of him in your article, Mr. Keller,â\\x80\\x9d he continued, turning\\r\\nto the boxer with a smile, â\\x80\\x9cbut he did not please me at all. I saw at\\r\\nonce that Tchebaroff was the moving spirit in the matter, and, to speak\\r\\nfrankly, I thought he might have induced you, Mr. Burdovsky, to make\\r\\nthis claim, by taking advantage of your simplicity.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have no right.... I am not simple,â\\x80\\x9d stammered Burdovsky, much\\r\\nagitated.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have no sort of right to suppose such things,â\\x80\\x9d said Lebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nnephew in a tone of authority.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is most offensive!â\\x80\\x9d shrieked Hippolyte; â\\x80\\x9cit is an insulting\\r\\nsuggestion, false, and most ill-timed.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI beg your pardon, gentlemen; please excuse me,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince. â\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nthought absolute frankness on both sides would be best, but have it\\r\\nyour own way. I told Tchebaroff that, as I was not in Petersburg, I\\r\\nwould commission a friend to look into the matter without delay, and\\r\\nthat I would let you know, Mr. Burdovsky. Gentlemen, I have no\\r\\nhesitation in telling you that it was the fact of Tchebaroffâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nintervention that made me suspect a fraud. Oh! do not take offence at\\r\\nmy words, gentlemen, for Heavenâ\\x80\\x99s sake do not be so touchy!â\\x80\\x9d cried the\\r\\nprince, seeing that Burdovsky was getting excited again, and that the\\r\\nrest were preparing to protest. â\\x80\\x9cIf I say I suspected a fraud, there is\\r\\nnothing personal in that. I had never seen any of you then; I did not\\r\\neven know your names; I only judged by Tchebaroff; I am speaking quite\\r\\ngenerallyâ\\x80\\x94if you only knew how I have been â\\x80\\x98doneâ\\x80\\x99 since I came into my\\r\\nfortune!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are shockingly naive, prince,â\\x80\\x9d said Lebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s nephew in mocking\\r\\ntones.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBesides, though you are a prince and a millionaire, and even though\\r\\nyou may really be simple and good-hearted, you can hardly be outside\\r\\nthe general law,â\\x80\\x9d Hippolyte declared loudly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPerhaps not; it is very possible,â\\x80\\x9d the prince agreed hastily, â\\x80\\x9cthough\\r\\nI do not know what general law you allude to. I will go onâ\\x80\\x94only please\\r\\ndo not take offence without good cause. I assure you I do not mean to\\r\\noffend you in the least. Really, it is impossible to speak three words\\r\\nsincerely without your flying into a rage! At first I was amazed when\\r\\nTchebaroff told me that Pavlicheff had a son, and that he was in such a\\r\\nmiserable position. Pavlicheff was my benefactor, and my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nfriend. Oh, Mr. Keller, why does your article impute things to my\\r\\nfather without the slightest foundation? He never squandered the funds\\r\\nof his company nor ill-treated his subordinates, I am absolutely\\r\\ncertain of it; I cannot imagine how you could bring yourself to write\\r\\nsuch a calumny! But your assertions concerning Pavlicheff are\\r\\nabsolutely intolerable! You do not scruple to make a libertine of that\\r\\nnoble man; you call him a sensualist as coolly as if you were speaking\\r\\nthe truth, and yet it would not be possible to find a chaster man. He\\r\\nwas even a scholar of note, and in correspondence with several\\r\\ncelebrated scientists, and spent large sums in the interests of\\r\\nscience. As to his kind heart and his good actions, you were right\\r\\nindeed when you said that I was almost an idiot at that time, and could\\r\\nhardly understand anythingâ\\x80\\x94(I could speak and understand Russian,\\r\\nthough),â\\x80\\x94but now I can appreciate what I rememberâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExcuse me,â\\x80\\x9d interrupted Hippolyte, â\\x80\\x9cis not this rather sentimental?\\r\\nYou said you wished to come to the point; please remember that it is\\r\\nafter nine oâ\\x80\\x99clock.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery well, gentlemenâ\\x80\\x94very well,â\\x80\\x9d replied the prince. â\\x80\\x9cAt first I\\r\\nreceived the news with mistrust, then I said to myself that I might be\\r\\nmistaken, and that Pavlicheff might possibly have had a son. But I was\\r\\nabsolutely amazed at the readiness with which the son had revealed the\\r\\nsecret of his birth at the expense of his motherâ\\x80\\x99s honour. For\\r\\nTchebaroff had already menaced me with publicity in our interview....â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat nonsense!â\\x80\\x9d Lebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s nephew interrupted violently.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have no rightâ\\x80\\x94you have no right!â\\x80\\x9d cried Burdovsky.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe son is not responsible for the misdeeds of his father; and the\\r\\nmother is not to blame,â\\x80\\x9d added Hippolyte, with warmth.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat seems to me all the more reason for sparing her,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince\\r\\ntimidly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPrince, you are not only simple, but your simplicity is almost past\\r\\nthe limit,â\\x80\\x9d said Lebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s nephew, with a sarcastic smile.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut what right had you?â\\x80\\x9d said Hippolyte in a very strange tone.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNoneâ\\x80\\x94none whatever,â\\x80\\x9d agreed the prince hastily. â\\x80\\x9cI admit you are right\\r\\nthere, but it was involuntary, and I immediately said to myself that my\\r\\npersonal feelings had nothing to do with it,â\\x80\\x94that if I thought it right\\r\\nto satisfy the demands of Mr. Burdovsky, out of respect for the memory\\r\\nof Pavlicheff, I ought to do so in any case, whether I esteemed Mr.\\r\\nBurdovsky or not. I only mentioned this, gentlemen, because it seemed\\r\\nso unnatural to me for a son to betray his motherâ\\x80\\x99s secret in such a\\r\\nway. In short, that is what convinced me that Tchebaroff must be a\\r\\nrogue, and that he had induced Mr. Burdovsky to attempt this fraud.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut this is intolerable!â\\x80\\x9d cried the visitors, some of them starting to\\r\\ntheir feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGentlemen, I supposed from this that poor Mr. Burdovsky must be a\\r\\nsimple-minded man, quite defenceless, and an easy tool in the hands of\\r\\nrogues. That is why I thought it my duty to try and help him as\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Pavlicheffâ\\x80\\x99s sonâ\\x80\\x99; in the first place by rescuing him from the\\r\\ninfluence of Tchebaroff, and secondly by making myself his friend. I\\r\\nhave resolved to give him ten thousand roubles; that is about the sum\\r\\nwhich I calculate that Pavlicheff must have spent on me.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat, only ten thousand!â\\x80\\x9d cried Hippolyte.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, prince, your arithmetic is not up to much, or else you are\\r\\nmighty clever at it, though you affect the air of a simpleton,â\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nLebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s nephew.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI will not accept ten thousand roubles,â\\x80\\x9d said Burdovsky.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAccept, Antip,â\\x80\\x9d whispered the boxer eagerly, leaning past the back of\\r\\nHippolyteâ\\x80\\x99s chair to give his friend this piece of advice. â\\x80\\x9cTake it for\\r\\nthe present; we can see about more later on.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLook here, Mr. Muishkin,â\\x80\\x9d shouted Hippolyte, â\\x80\\x9cplease understand that\\r\\nwe are not fools, nor idiots, as your guests seem to imagine; these\\r\\nladies who look upon us with such scorn, and especially this fine\\r\\ngentlemanâ\\x80\\x9d (pointing to Evgenie Pavlovitch) â\\x80\\x9cwhom I have not the honour\\r\\nof knowing, though I think I have heard some talk about himâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cReally, really, gentlemen,â\\x80\\x9d cried the prince in great agitation, â\\x80\\x9cyou\\r\\nare misunderstanding me again. In the first place, Mr. Keller, you have\\r\\ngreatly overestimated my fortune in your article. I am far from being a\\r\\nmillionaire. I have barely a tenth of what you suppose. Secondly, my\\r\\ntreatment in Switzerland was very far from costing tens of thousands of\\r\\nroubles. Schneider received six hundred roubles a year, and he was only\\r\\npaid for the first three years. As to the pretty governesses whom\\r\\nPavlicheff is supposed to have brought from Paris, they only exist in\\r\\nMr. Kellerâ\\x80\\x99s imagination; it is another calumny. According to my\\r\\ncalculations, the sum spent on me was very considerably under ten\\r\\nthousand roubles, but I decided on that sum, and you must admit that in\\r\\npaying a debt I could not offer Mr. Burdovsky more, however kindly\\r\\ndisposed I might be towards him; delicacy forbids it; I should seem to\\r\\nbe offering him charity instead of rightful payment. I donâ\\x80\\x99t know how\\r\\nyou cannot see that, gentlemen! Besides, I had no intention of leaving\\r\\nthe matter there. I meant to intervene amicably later on and help to\\r\\nimprove poor Mr. Burdovskyâ\\x80\\x99s position. It is clear that he has been\\r\\ndeceived, or he would never have agreed to anything so vile as the\\r\\nscandalous revelations about his mother in Mr. Kellerâ\\x80\\x99s article. But,\\r\\ngentlemen, why are you getting angry again? Are we never to come to an\\r\\nunderstanding? Well, the event has proved me right! I have just seen\\r\\nwith my own eyes the proof that my conjecture was correct!â\\x80\\x9d he added,\\r\\nwith increasing eagerness.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe meant to calm his hearers, and did not perceive that his words had\\r\\nonly increased their irritation.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean? What are you convinced of?â\\x80\\x9d they demanded angrily.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn the first place, I have had the opportunity of getting a correct\\r\\nidea of Mr. Burdovsky. I see what he is for myself. He is an innocent\\r\\nman, deceived by everyone! A defenceless victim, who deserves\\r\\nindulgence! Secondly, Gavrila Ardalionovitch, in whose hands I had\\r\\nplaced the matter, had his first interview with me barely an hour ago.\\r\\nI had not heard from him for some time, as I was away, and have been\\r\\nill for three days since my return to St. Petersburg. He tells me that\\r\\nhe has exposed the designs of Tchebaroff and has proof that justifies\\r\\nmy opinion of him. I know, gentlemen, that many people think me an\\r\\nidiot. Counting upon my reputation as a man whose purse-strings are\\r\\neasily loosened, Tchebaroff thought it would be a simple matter to\\r\\nfleece me, especially by trading on my gratitude to Pavlicheff. But the\\r\\nmain point isâ\\x80\\x94listen, gentlemen, let me finish!â\\x80\\x94the main point is that\\r\\nMr. Burdovsky is not Pavlicheffâ\\x80\\x99s son at all. Gavrila Ardalionovitch\\r\\nhas just told me of his discovery, and assures me that he has positive\\r\\nproofs. Well, what do you think of that? It is scarcely credible, even\\r\\nafter all the tricks that have been played upon me. Please note that we\\r\\nhave positive proofs! I can hardly believe it myself, I assure you; I\\r\\ndo not yet believe it; I am still doubtful, because Gavrila\\r\\nArdalionovitch has not had time to go into details; but there can be no\\r\\nfurther doubt that Tchebaroff is a rogue! He has deceived poor Mr.\\r\\nBurdovsky, and all of you, gentlemen, who have come forward so nobly to\\r\\nsupport your friendâ\\x80\\x94(he evidently needs support, I quite see that!). He\\r\\nhas abused your credulity and involved you all in an attempted fraud,\\r\\nfor when all is said and done this claim is nothing else!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat! a fraud? What, he is not Pavlicheffâ\\x80\\x99s son? Impossible!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThese exclamations but feebly expressed the profound bewilderment into\\r\\nwhich the princeâ\\x80\\x99s words had plunged Burdovskyâ\\x80\\x99s companions.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly it is a fraud! Since Mr. Burdovsky is not Pavlicheffâ\\x80\\x99s son,\\r\\nhis claim is neither more nor less than attempted fraud (supposing, of\\r\\ncourse, that he had known the truth), but the fact is that he has been\\r\\ndeceived. I insist on this point in order to justify him; I repeat that\\r\\nhis simple-mindedness makes him worthy of pity, and that he cannot\\r\\nstand alone; otherwise he would have behaved like a scoundrel in this\\r\\nmatter. But I feel certain that he does not understand it! I was just\\r\\nthe same myself before I went to Switzerland; I stammered incoherently;\\r\\none tries to express oneself and cannot. I understand that. I am all\\r\\nthe better able to pity Mr. Burdovsky, because I know from experience\\r\\nwhat it is to be like that, and so I have a right to speak. Well,\\r\\nthough there is no such person as â\\x80\\x98Pavlicheffâ\\x80\\x99s son,â\\x80\\x99 and it is all\\r\\nnothing but a humbug, yet I will keep to my decision, and I am prepared\\r\\nto give up ten thousand roubles in memory of Pavlicheff. Before Mr.\\r\\nBurdovsky made this claim, I proposed to found a school with this\\r\\nmoney, in memory of my benefactor, but I shall honour his memory quite\\r\\nas well by giving the ten thousand roubles to Mr. Burdovsky, because,\\r\\nthough he was not Pavlicheffâ\\x80\\x99s son, he was treated almost as though he\\r\\nwere. That is what gave a rogue the opportunity of deceiving him; he\\r\\nreally did think himself Pavlicheffâ\\x80\\x99s son. Listen, gentlemen; this\\r\\nmatter must be settled; keep calm; do not get angry; and sit down!\\r\\nGavrila Ardalionovitch will explain everything to you at once, and I\\r\\nconfess that I am very anxious to hear all the details myself. He says\\r\\nthat he has even been to Pskoff to see your mother, Mr. Burdovsky; she\\r\\nis not dead, as the article which was just read to us makes out. Sit\\r\\ndown, gentlemen, sit down!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince sat down, and at length prevailed upon Burdovskyâ\\x80\\x99s company\\r\\nto do likewise. During the last ten or twenty minutes, exasperated by\\r\\ncontinual interruptions, he had raised his voice, and spoken with great\\r\\nvehemence. Now, no doubt, he bitterly regretted several words and\\r\\nexpressions which had escaped him in his excitement. If he had not been\\r\\ndriven beyond the limits of endurance, he would not have ventured to\\r\\nexpress certain conjectures so openly. He had no sooner sat down than\\r\\nhis heart was torn by sharp remorse. Besides insulting Burdovsky with\\r\\nthe supposition, made in the presence of witnesses, that he was\\r\\nsuffering from the complaint for which he had himself been treated in\\r\\nSwitzerland, he reproached himself with the grossest indelicacy in\\r\\nhaving offered him the ten thousand roubles before everyone. â\\x80\\x9cI ought\\r\\nto have waited till to-morrow and offered him the money when we were\\r\\nalone,â\\x80\\x9d thought Muishkin. â\\x80\\x9cNow it is too late, the mischief is done!\\r\\nYes, I am an idiot, an absolute idiot!â\\x80\\x9d he said to himself, overcome\\r\\nwith shame and regret.\\r\\n\\r\\nTill then Gavrila Ardalionovitch had sat apart in silence. When the\\r\\nprince called upon him, he came and stood by his side, and in a calm,\\r\\nclear voice began to render an account of the mission confided to him.\\r\\nAll conversation ceased instantly. Everyone, especially the Burdovsky\\r\\nparty, listened with the utmost curiosity.\\r\\n\\r\\nIX.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou will not deny, I am sure,â\\x80\\x9d said Gavrila Ardalionovitch, turning to\\r\\nBurdovsky, who sat looking at him with wide-open eyes, perplexed and\\r\\nastonished. â\\x80\\x9cYou will not deny, seriously, that you were born just two\\r\\nyears after your motherâ\\x80\\x99s legal marriage to Mr. Burdovsky, your father.\\r\\nNothing would be easier than to prove the date of your birth from\\r\\nwell-known facts; we can only look on Mr. Kellerâ\\x80\\x99s version as a work of\\r\\nimagination, and one, moreover, extremely offensive both to you and\\r\\nyour mother. Of course he distorted the truth in order to strengthen\\r\\nyour claim, and to serve your interests. Mr. Keller said that he\\r\\npreviously consulted you about his article in the paper, but did not\\r\\nread it to you as a whole. Certainly he could not have read that\\r\\npassage...â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAs a matter of fact, I did not read it,â\\x80\\x9d interrupted the boxer, â\\x80\\x9cbut\\r\\nits contents had been given me on unimpeachable authority, and I...â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExcuse me, Mr. Keller,â\\x80\\x9d interposed Gavrila Ardalionovitch. â\\x80\\x9cAllow me\\r\\nto speak. I assure you your article shall be mentioned in its proper\\r\\nplace, and you can then explain everything, but for the moment I would\\r\\nrather not anticipate. Quite accidentally, with the help of my sister,\\r\\nVarvara Ardalionovna Ptitsin, I obtained from one of her intimate\\r\\nfriends, Madame Zoubkoff, a letter written to her twenty-five years\\r\\nago, by Nicolai Andreevitch Pavlicheff, then abroad. After getting into\\r\\ncommunication with this lady, I went by her advice to Timofei\\r\\nFedorovitch Viazovkin, a retired colonel, and one of Pavlicheffâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\noldest friends. He gave me two more letters written by the latter when\\r\\nhe was still in foreign parts. These three documents, their dates, and\\r\\nthe facts mentioned in them, prove in the most undeniable manner, that\\r\\neighteen months before your birth, Nicolai Andreevitch went abroad,\\r\\nwhere he remained for three consecutive years. Your mother, as you are\\r\\nwell aware, has never been out of Russia.... It is too late to read the\\r\\nletters now; I am content to state the fact. But if you desire it, come\\r\\nto me tomorrow morning, bring witnesses and writing experts with you,\\r\\nand I will prove the absolute truth of my story. From that moment the\\r\\nquestion will be decided.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThese words caused a sensation among the listeners, and there was a\\r\\ngeneral movement of relief. Burdovsky got up abruptly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf that is true,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cI have been deceived, grossly deceived,\\r\\nbut not by Tchebaroff: and for a long time past, a long time. I do not\\r\\nwish for experts, not I, nor to go to see you. I believe you. I give it\\r\\nup.... But I refuse the ten thousand roubles. Good-bye.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWait five minutes more, Mr. Burdovsky,â\\x80\\x9d said Gavrila Ardalionovitch\\r\\npleasantly. â\\x80\\x9cI have more to say. Some rather curious and important\\r\\nfacts have come to light, and it is absolutely necessary, in my\\r\\nopinion, that you should hear them. You will not regret, I fancy, to\\r\\nhave the whole matter thoroughly cleared up.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBurdovsky silently resumed his seat, and bent his head as though in\\r\\nprofound thought. His friend, Lebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s nephew, who had risen to\\r\\naccompany him, also sat down again. He seemed much disappointed, though\\r\\nas self-confident as ever. Hippolyte looked dejected and sulky, as well\\r\\nas surprised. He had just been attacked by a violent fit of coughing,\\r\\nso that his handkerchief was stained with blood. The boxer looked\\r\\nthoroughly frightened.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, Antip!â\\x80\\x9d cried he in a miserable voice, â\\x80\\x9cI did say to you the other\\r\\ndayâ\\x80\\x94the day before yesterdayâ\\x80\\x94that perhaps you were not really\\r\\nPavlicheffâ\\x80\\x99s son!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were sounds of half-smothered laughter at this.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow, that is a valuable piece of information, Mr. Keller,â\\x80\\x9d replied\\r\\nGania. â\\x80\\x9cHowever that may be, I have private information which convinces\\r\\nme that Mr. Burdovsky, though doubtless aware of the date of his birth,\\r\\nknew nothing at all about Pavlicheffâ\\x80\\x99s sojourn abroad. Indeed, he\\r\\npassed the greater part of his life out of Russia, returning at\\r\\nintervals for short visits. The journey in question is in itself too\\r\\nunimportant for his friends to recollect it after more than twenty\\r\\nyears; and of course Mr. Burdovsky could have known nothing about it,\\r\\nfor he was not born. As the event has proved, it was not impossible to\\r\\nfind evidence of his absence, though I must confess that chance has\\r\\nhelped me in a quest which might very well have come to nothing. It was\\r\\nreally almost impossible for Burdovsky or Tchebaroff to discover these\\r\\nfacts, even if it had entered their heads to try. Naturally they never\\r\\ndreamt...â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHere the voice of Hippolyte suddenly intervened.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAllow me, Mr. Ivolgin,â\\x80\\x9d he said irritably. â\\x80\\x9cWhat is the good of all\\r\\nthis rigmarole? Pardon me. All is now clear, and we acknowledge the\\r\\ntruth of your main point. Why go into these tedious details? You wish\\r\\nperhaps to boast of the cleverness of your investigation, to cry up\\r\\nyour talents as detective? Or perhaps your intention is to excuse\\r\\nBurdovsky, by proving that he took up the matter in ignorance? Well, I\\r\\nconsider that extremely impudent on your part! You ought to know that\\r\\nBurdovsky has no need of being excused or justified by you or anyone\\r\\nelse! It is an insult! The affair is quite painful enough for him\\r\\nwithout that. Will nothing make you understand?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEnough! enough! Mr. Terentieff,â\\x80\\x9d interrupted Gania.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t excite yourself; you seem very ill, and I am sorry for that. I\\r\\nam almost done, but there are a few facts to which I must briefly\\r\\nrefer, as I am convinced that they ought to be clearly explained once\\r\\nfor all....â\\x80\\x9d A movement of impatience was noticed in his audience as he\\r\\nresumed: â\\x80\\x9cI merely wish to state, for the information of all concerned,\\r\\nthat the reason for Mr. Pavlicheffâ\\x80\\x99s interest in your mother, Mr.\\r\\nBurdovsky, was simply that she was the sister of a serf-girl with whom\\r\\nhe was deeply in love in his youth, and whom most certainly he would\\r\\nhave married but for her sudden death. I have proofs that this\\r\\ncircumstance is almost, if not quite, forgotten. I may add that when\\r\\nyour mother was about ten years old, Pavlicheff took her under his\\r\\ncare, gave her a good education, and later, a considerable dowry. His\\r\\nrelations were alarmed, and feared he might go so far as to marry her,\\r\\nbut she gave her hand to a young land-surveyor named Burdovsky when she\\r\\nreached the age of twenty. I can even say definitely that it was a\\r\\nmarriage of affection. After his wedding your father gave up his\\r\\noccupation as land-surveyor, and with his wifeâ\\x80\\x99s dowry of fifteen\\r\\nthousand roubles went in for commercial speculations. As he had had no\\r\\nexperience, he was cheated on all sides, and took to drink in order to\\r\\nforget his troubles. He shortened his life by his excesses, and eight\\r\\nyears after his marriage he died. Your mother says herself that she was\\r\\nleft in the direst poverty, and would have died of starvation had it\\r\\nnot been for Pavlicheff, who generously allowed her a yearly pension of\\r\\nsix hundred roubles. Many people recall his extreme fondness for you as\\r\\na little boy. Your mother confirms this, and agrees with others in\\r\\nthinking that he loved you the more because you were a sickly child,\\r\\nstammering in your speech, and almost deformedâ\\x80\\x94for it is known that all\\r\\nhis life Nicolai Andreevitch had a partiality for unfortunates of every\\r\\nkind, especially children. In my opinion this is most important. I may\\r\\nadd that I discovered yet another fact, the last on which I employed my\\r\\ndetective powers. Seeing how fond Pavlicheff was of you,â\\x80\\x94it was thanks\\r\\nto him you went to school, and also had the advantage of special\\r\\nteachersâ\\x80\\x94his relations and servants grew to believe that you were his\\r\\nson, and that your father had been betrayed by his wife. I may point\\r\\nout that this idea was only accredited generally during the last years\\r\\nof Pavlicheffâ\\x80\\x99s life, when his next-of-kin were trembling about the\\r\\nsuccession, when the earlier story was quite forgotten, and when all\\r\\nopportunity for discovering the truth had seemingly passed away. No\\r\\ndoubt you, Mr. Burdovsky, heard this conjecture, and did not hesitate\\r\\nto accept it as true. I have had the honour of making your motherâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nacquaintance, and I find that she knows all about these reports. What\\r\\nshe does not know is that you, her son, should have listened to them so\\r\\ncomplaisantly. I found your respected mother at Pskoff, ill and in deep\\r\\npoverty, as she has been ever since the death of your benefactor. She\\r\\ntold me with tears of gratitude how you had supported her; she expects\\r\\nmuch of you, and believes fervently in your future success...â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, this is unbearable!â\\x80\\x9d said Lebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s nephew impatiently. â\\x80\\x9cWhat is\\r\\nthe good of all this romancing?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is revolting and unseemly!â\\x80\\x9d cried Hippolyte, jumping up in a fury.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurdovsky alone sat silent and motionless.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat is the good of it?â\\x80\\x9d repeated Gavrila Ardalionovitch, with\\r\\npretended surprise. â\\x80\\x9cWell, firstly, because now perhaps Mr. Burdovsky\\r\\nis quite convinced that Mr. Pavlicheffâ\\x80\\x99s love for him came simply from\\r\\ngenerosity of soul, and not from paternal duty. It was most necessary\\r\\nto impress this fact upon his mind, considering that he approved of the\\r\\narticle written by Mr. Keller. I speak thus because I look on you, Mr.\\r\\nBurdovsky, as an honourable man. Secondly, it appears that there was no\\r\\nintention of cheating in this case, even on the part of Tchebaroff. I\\r\\nwish to say this quite plainly, because the prince hinted a while ago\\r\\nthat I too thought it an attempt at robbery and extortion. On the\\r\\ncontrary, everyone has been quite sincere in the matter, and although\\r\\nTchebaroff may be somewhat of a rogue, in this business he has acted\\r\\nsimply as any sharp lawyer would do under the circumstances. He looked\\r\\nat it as a case that might bring him in a lot of money, and he did not\\r\\ncalculate badly; because on the one hand he speculated on the\\r\\ngenerosity of the prince, and his gratitude to the late Mr. Pavlicheff,\\r\\nand on the other to his chivalrous ideas as to the obligations of\\r\\nhonour and conscience. As to Mr. Burdovsky, allowing for his\\r\\nprinciples, we may acknowledge that he engaged in the business with\\r\\nvery little personal aim in view. At the instigation of Tchebaroff and\\r\\nhis other friends, he decided to make the attempt in the service of\\r\\ntruth, progress, and humanity. In short, the conclusion may be drawn\\r\\nthat, in spite of all appearances, Mr. Burdovsky is a man of\\r\\nirreproachable character, and thus the prince can all the more readily\\r\\noffer him his friendship, and the assistance of which he spoke just\\r\\nnow...â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHush! hush! Gavrila Ardalionovitch!â\\x80\\x9d cried Muishkin in dismay, but it\\r\\nwas too late.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI said, and I have repeated it over and over again,â\\x80\\x9d shouted Burdovsky\\r\\nfuriously, â\\x80\\x9cthat I did not want the money. I will not take it...\\r\\nwhy...I will not... I am going away!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was rushing hurriedly from the terrace, when Lebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s nephew\\r\\nseized his arms, and said something to him in a low voice. Burdovsky\\r\\nturned quickly, and drawing an addressed but unsealed envelope from his\\r\\npocket, he threw it down on a little table beside the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s the money!... How dare you?... The money!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThose are the two hundred and fifty roubles you dared to send him as a\\r\\ncharity, by the hands of Tchebaroff,â\\x80\\x9d explained Doktorenko.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe article in the newspaper put it at fifty!â\\x80\\x9d cried Colia.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI beg your pardon,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, going up to Burdovsky. â\\x80\\x9cI have\\r\\ndone you a great wrong, but I did not send you that money as a charity,\\r\\nbelieve me. And now I am again to blame. I offended you just now.â\\x80\\x9d (The\\r\\nprince was much distressed; he seemed worn out with fatigue, and spoke\\r\\nalmost incoherently.) â\\x80\\x9cI spoke of swindling... but I did not apply that\\r\\nto you. I was deceived .... I said you were... afflicted... like me...\\r\\nBut you are not like me... you give lessons... you support your mother.\\r\\nI said you had dishonoured your mother, but you love her. She says so\\r\\nherself... I did not know... Gavrila Ardalionovitch did not tell me\\r\\nthat... Forgive me! I dared to offer you ten thousand roubles, but I\\r\\nwas wrong. I ought to have done it differently, and now... there is no\\r\\nway of doing it, for you despise me...â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI declare, this is a lunatic asylum!â\\x80\\x9d cried Lizabetha Prokofievna.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course it is a lunatic asylum!â\\x80\\x9d repeated Aglaya sharply, but her\\r\\nwords were overpowered by other voices. Everybody was talking loudly,\\r\\nmaking remarks and comments; some discussed the affair gravely, others\\r\\nlaughed. Ivan Fedorovitch Epanchin was extremely indignant. He stood\\r\\nwaiting for his wife with an air of offended dignity. Lebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s nephew\\r\\ntook up the word again.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, prince, to do you justice, you certainly know how to make the\\r\\nmost of yourâ\\x80\\x94let us call it infirmity, for the sake of politeness; you\\r\\nhave set about offering your money and friendship in such a way that no\\r\\nself-respecting man could possibly accept them. This is an excess of\\r\\ningenuousness or of maliceâ\\x80\\x94you ought to know better than anyone which\\r\\nword best fits the case.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAllow me, gentlemen,â\\x80\\x9d said Gavrila Ardalionovitch, who had just\\r\\nexamined the contents of the envelope, â\\x80\\x9cthere are only a hundred\\r\\nroubles here, not two hundred and fifty. I point this out, prince, to\\r\\nprevent misunderstanding.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNever mind, never mind,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, signing to him to keep\\r\\nquiet.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut we do mind,â\\x80\\x9d said Lebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s nephew vehemently. â\\x80\\x9cPrince, your\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98never mindâ\\x80\\x99 is an insult to us. We have nothing to hide; our actions\\r\\ncan bear daylight. It is true that there are only a hundred roubles\\r\\ninstead of two hundred and fifty, but it is all the same.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, no, it is hardly the same,â\\x80\\x9d remarked Gavrila Ardalionovitch, with\\r\\nan air of ingenuous surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t interrupt, we are not such fools as you think, Mr. Lawyer,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\ncried Lebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s nephew angrily. â\\x80\\x9cOf course there is a difference\\r\\nbetween a hundred roubles and two hundred and fifty, but in this case\\r\\nthe principle is the main point, and that a hundred and fifty roubles\\r\\nare missing is only a side issue. The point to be emphasized is that\\r\\nBurdovsky will not accept your highnessâ\\x80\\x99s charity; he flings it back in\\r\\nyour face, and it scarcely matters if there are a hundred roubles or\\r\\ntwo hundred and fifty. Burdovsky has refused ten thousand roubles; you\\r\\nheard him. He would not have returned even a hundred roubles if he was\\r\\ndishonest! The hundred and fifty roubles were paid to Tchebaroff for\\r\\nhis travelling expenses. You may jeer at our stupidity and at our\\r\\ninexperience in business matters; you have done all you could already\\r\\nto make us look ridiculous; but do not dare to call us dishonest. The\\r\\nfour of us will club together every day to repay the hundred and fifty\\r\\nroubles to the prince, if we have to pay it in instalments of a rouble\\r\\nat a time, but we will repay it, with interest. Burdovsky is poor, he\\r\\nhas no millions. After his journey to see the prince Tchebaroff sent in\\r\\nhis bill. We counted on winning... Who would not have done the same in\\r\\nsuch a case?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWho indeed?â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Prince S.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI shall certainly go mad, if I stay here!â\\x80\\x9d cried Lizabetha\\r\\nProkofievna.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt reminds me,â\\x80\\x9d said Evgenie Pavlovitch, laughing, â\\x80\\x9cof the famous plea\\r\\nof a certain lawyer who lately defended a man for murdering six people\\r\\nin order to rob them. He excused his client on the score of poverty.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98It is quite natural,â\\x80\\x99 he said in conclusion, â\\x80\\x98considering the state of\\r\\nmisery he was in, that he should have thought of murdering these six\\r\\npeople; which of you, gentlemen, would not have done the same in his\\r\\nplace?â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEnough,â\\x80\\x9d cried Lizabetha Prokofievna abruptly, trembling with anger,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwe have had enough of this balderdash!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a state of terrible excitement she threw back her head, with flaming\\r\\neyes, casting looks of contempt and defiance upon the whole company, in\\r\\nwhich she could no longer distinguish friend from foe. She had\\r\\nrestrained herself so long that she felt forced to vent her rage on\\r\\nsomebody. Those who knew Lizabetha Prokofievna saw at once how it was\\r\\nwith her. â\\x80\\x9cShe flies into these rages sometimes,â\\x80\\x9d said Ivan Fedorovitch\\r\\nto Prince S. the next day, â\\x80\\x9cbut she is not often so violent as she was\\r\\nyesterday; it does not happen more than once in three years.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBe quiet, Ivan Fedorovitch! Leave me alone!â\\x80\\x9d cried Mrs. Epanchin. â\\x80\\x9cWhy\\r\\ndo you offer me your arm now? You had not sense enough to take me away\\r\\nbefore. You are my husband, you are a father, it was your duty to drag\\r\\nme away by force, if in my folly I refused to obey you and go quietly.\\r\\nYou might at least have thought of your daughters. We can find our way\\r\\nout now without your help. Here is shame enough for a year! Wait a\\r\\nmoment â\\x80\\x98till I thank the prince! Thank you, prince, for the\\r\\nentertainment you have given us! It was most amusing to hear these\\r\\nyoung men... It is vile, vile! A chaos, a scandal, worse than a\\r\\nnightmare! Is it possible that there can be many such people on earth?\\r\\nBe quiet, Aglaya! Be quiet, Alexandra! It is none of your business!\\r\\nDonâ\\x80\\x99t fuss round me like that, Evgenie Pavlovitch; you exasperate me!\\r\\nSo, my dear,â\\x80\\x9d she cried, addressing the prince, â\\x80\\x9cyou go so far as to\\r\\nbeg their pardon! He says, â\\x80\\x98Forgive me for offering you a fortune.â\\x80\\x99 And\\r\\nyou, you mountebank, what are you laughing at?â\\x80\\x9d she cried, turning\\r\\nsuddenly on Lebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s nephew. â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98We refuse ten thousand roubles; we do\\r\\nnot beseech, we demand!â\\x80\\x99 As if he did not know that this idiot will\\r\\ncall on them tomorrow to renew his offers of money and friendship. You\\r\\nwill, wonâ\\x80\\x99t you? You will? Come, will you, or wonâ\\x80\\x99t you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI shall,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, with gentle humility.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou hear him! You count upon it, too,â\\x80\\x9d she continued, turning upon\\r\\nDoktorenko. â\\x80\\x9cYou are as sure of him now as if you had the money in your\\r\\npocket. And there you are playing the swaggerer to throw dust in our\\r\\neyes! No, my dear sir, you may take other people in! I can see through\\r\\nall your airs and graces, I see your game!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLizabetha Prokofievna!â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome, Lizabetha Prokofievna, it is quite time for us to be going, we\\r\\nwill take the prince with us,â\\x80\\x9d said Prince S. with a smile, in the\\r\\ncoolest possible way.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girls stood apart, almost frightened; their father was positively\\r\\nhorrified. Mrs. Epanchinâ\\x80\\x99s language astonished everybody. Some who\\r\\nstood a little way off smiled furtively, and talked in whispers.\\r\\nLebedeff wore an expression of utmost ecstasy.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cChaos and scandal are to be found everywhere, madame,â\\x80\\x9d remarked\\r\\nDoktorenko, who was considerably put out of countenance.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot like this! Nothing like the spectacle you have just given us,\\r\\nsir,â\\x80\\x9d answered Lizabetha Prokofievna, with a sort of hysterical rage.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLeave me alone, will you?â\\x80\\x9d she cried violently to those around her,\\r\\nwho were trying to keep her quiet. â\\x80\\x9cNo, Evgenie Pavlovitch, if, as you\\r\\nsaid yourself just now, a lawyer said in open court that he found it\\r\\nquite natural that a man should murder six people because he was in\\r\\nmisery, the world must be coming to an end. I had not heard of it\\r\\nbefore. Now I understand everything. And this stutterer, wonâ\\x80\\x99t he turn\\r\\nout a murderer?â\\x80\\x9d she cried, pointing to Burdovsky, who was staring at\\r\\nher with stupefaction. â\\x80\\x9cI bet he will! He will have none of your money,\\r\\npossibly, he will refuse it because his conscience will not allow him\\r\\nto accept it, but he will go murdering you by night and walking off\\r\\nwith your cashbox, with a clear conscience! He does not call it a\\r\\ndishonest action but â\\x80\\x98the impulse of a noble despairâ\\x80\\x99; â\\x80\\x98a negationâ\\x80\\x99; or\\r\\nthe devil knows what! Bah! everything is upside down, everyone walks\\r\\nhead downwards. A young girl, brought up at home, suddenly jumps into a\\r\\ncab in the middle of the street, saying: â\\x80\\x98Good-bye, mother, I married\\r\\nKarlitch, or Ivanitch, the other day!â\\x80\\x99 And you think it quite right?\\r\\nYou call such conduct estimable and natural? The â\\x80\\x98woman questionâ\\x80\\x99? Look\\r\\nhere,â\\x80\\x9d she continued, pointing to Colia, â\\x80\\x9cthe other day that\\r\\nwhippersnapper told me that this was the whole meaning of the â\\x80\\x98woman\\r\\nquestion.â\\x80\\x99 But even supposing that your mother is a fool, you are none\\r\\nthe less, bound to treat her with humanity. Why did you come here\\r\\ntonight so insolently? â\\x80\\x98Give us our rights, but donâ\\x80\\x99t dare to speak in\\r\\nour presence. Show us every mark of deepest respect, while we treat you\\r\\nlike the scum of the earth.â\\x80\\x99 The miscreants have written a tissue of\\r\\ncalumny in their article, and these are the men who seek for truth, and\\r\\ndo battle for the right! â\\x80\\x98We do not beseech, we demand, you will get no\\r\\nthanks from us, because you will be acting to satisfy your own\\r\\nconscience!â\\x80\\x99 What morality! But, good heavens! if you declare that the\\r\\nprinceâ\\x80\\x99s generosity will, excite no gratitude in you, he might answer\\r\\nthat he is not, bound to be grateful to Pavlicheff, who also was only\\r\\nsatisfying his own conscience. But you counted on the princeâ\\x80\\x99s,\\r\\ngratitude towards Pavlicheff; you never lent him any money; he owes you\\r\\nnothing; then what were you counting upon if not on his gratitude? And\\r\\nif you appeal to that sentiment in others, why should you expect to be\\r\\nexempted from it? They are mad! They say society is savage and inhuman\\r\\nbecause it despises a young girl who has been seduced. But if you call\\r\\nsociety inhuman you imply that the young girl is made to suffer by its\\r\\ncensure. How then, can you hold her up to the scorn of society in the\\r\\nnewspapers without realizing that you are making her suffering, still\\r\\ngreater? Madmen! Vain fools! They donâ\\x80\\x99t believe in God, they donâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nbelieve in Christ! But you are so eaten up by pride and vanity, that\\r\\nyou will end by devouring each otherâ\\x80\\x94that is my prophecy! Is not this\\r\\nabsurd? Is it not monstrous chaos? And after all this, that shameless\\r\\ncreature will go and beg their pardon! Are there many people like you?\\r\\nWhat are you smiling at? Because I am not ashamed to disgrace myself\\r\\nbefore you?â\\x80\\x94Yes, I am disgracedâ\\x80\\x94it canâ\\x80\\x99t be helped now! But donâ\\x80\\x99t you\\r\\njeer at me, you scum!â\\x80\\x9d (this was aimed at Hippolyte). â\\x80\\x9cHe is almost at\\r\\nhis last gasp, yet he corrupts others. You, have got hold of this ladâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n(she pointed to Colia); â\\x80\\x9cyou, have turned his head, you have taught him\\r\\nto be an atheist, you donâ\\x80\\x99t believe in God, and you are not too old to\\r\\nbe whipped, sir! A plague upon you! And so, Prince Lef Nicolaievitch,\\r\\nyou will call on them tomorrow, will you?â\\x80\\x9d she asked the prince\\r\\nbreathlessly, for the second time.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen I will never speak to you again.â\\x80\\x9d She made a sudden movement to\\r\\ngo, and then turned quickly back. â\\x80\\x9cAnd you will call on that atheist?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nshe continued, pointing to Hippolyte. â\\x80\\x9cHow dare you grin at me like\\r\\nthat?â\\x80\\x9d she shouted furiously, rushing at the invalid, whose mocking\\r\\nsmile drove her to distraction.\\r\\n\\r\\nExclamations arose on all sides.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLizabetha Prokofievna! Lizabetha Prokofievna! Lizabetha Prokofievna!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMother, this is disgraceful!â\\x80\\x9d cried Aglaya.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Epanchin had approached Hippolyte and seized him firmly by the\\r\\narm, while her eyes, blazing with fury, were fixed upon his face.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo not distress yourself, Aglaya Ivanovitch,â\\x80\\x9d he answered calmly;\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyour mother knows that one cannot strike a dying man. I am ready to\\r\\nexplain why I was laughing. I shall be delighted if you will let meâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA violent fit of coughing, which lasted a full minute, prevented him\\r\\nfrom finishing his sentence.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe is dying, yet he will not stop holding forth!â\\x80\\x9d cried Lizabetha\\r\\nProkofievna. She loosed her hold on his arm, almost terrified, as she\\r\\nsaw him wiping the blood from his lips. â\\x80\\x9cWhy do you talk? You ought to\\r\\ngo home to bed.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo I will,â\\x80\\x9d he whispered hoarsely. â\\x80\\x9cAs soon as I get home I will go to\\r\\nbed at once; and I know I shall be dead in a fortnight; Botkine told me\\r\\nso himself last week. That is why I should like to say a few farewell\\r\\nwords, if you will let me.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut you must be mad! It is ridiculous! You should take care of\\r\\nyourself; what is the use of holding a conversation now? Go home to\\r\\nbed, do!â\\x80\\x9d cried Mrs. Epanchin in horror.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen I do go to bed I shall never get up again,â\\x80\\x9d said Hippolyte, with\\r\\na smile. â\\x80\\x9cI meant to take to my bed yesterday and stay there till I\\r\\ndied, but as my legs can still carry me, I put it off for two days, so\\r\\nas to come here with them to-dayâ\\x80\\x94but I am very tired.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, sit down, sit down, why are you standing?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLizabetha Prokofievna placed a chair for him with her own hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank you,â\\x80\\x9d he said gently. â\\x80\\x9cSit opposite to me, and let us talk. We\\r\\nmust have a talk now, Lizabetha Prokofievna; I am very anxious for it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nHe smiled at her once more. â\\x80\\x9cRemember that today, for the last time, I\\r\\nam out in the air, and in the company of my fellow-men, and that in a\\r\\nfortnight I shall certainly be no longer in this world. So, in a way,\\r\\nthis is my farewell to nature and to men. I am not very sentimental,\\r\\nbut do you know, I am quite glad that all this has happened at\\r\\nPavlofsk, where at least one can see a green tree.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut why talk now?â\\x80\\x9d replied Lizabetha Prokofievna, more and more\\r\\nalarmed; â\\x80\\x9cYou are quite feverish. Just now you would not stop shouting,\\r\\nand now you can hardly breathe. You are gasping.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI shall have time to rest. Why will you not grant my last wish? Do you\\r\\nknow, Lizabetha Prokofievna, that I have dreamed of meeting you for a\\r\\nlong while? I had often heard of you from Colia; he is almost the only\\r\\nperson who still comes to see me. You are an original and eccentric\\r\\nwoman; I have seen that for myselfâ\\x80\\x94Do you know, I have even been rather\\r\\nfond of you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood heavens! And I very nearly struck him!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou were prevented by Aglaya Ivanovna. I think I am not mistaken? That\\r\\nis your daughter, Aglaya Ivanovna? She is so beautiful that I\\r\\nrecognized her directly, although I had never seen her before. Let me,\\r\\nat least, look on beauty for the last time in my life,â\\x80\\x9d he said with a\\r\\nwry smile. â\\x80\\x9cYou are here with the prince, and your husband, and a large\\r\\ncompany. Why should you refuse to gratify my last wish?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGive me a chair!â\\x80\\x9d cried Lizabetha Prokofievna, but she seized one for\\r\\nherself and sat down opposite to Hippolyte. â\\x80\\x9cColia, you must go home\\r\\nwith him,â\\x80\\x9d she commanded, â\\x80\\x9cand tomorrow I will come my self.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWill you let me ask the prince for a cup of tea?... I am exhausted. Do\\r\\nyou know what you might do, Lizabetha Prokofievna? I think you wanted\\r\\nto take the prince home with you for tea. Stay here, and let us spend\\r\\nthe evening together. I am sure the prince will give us all some tea.\\r\\nForgive me for being so free and easyâ\\x80\\x94but I know you are kind, and the\\r\\nprince is kind, too. In fact, we are all good-natured peopleâ\\x80\\x94it is\\r\\nreally quite comical.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince bestirred himself to give orders. Lebedeff hurried out,\\r\\nfollowed by Vera.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is quite true,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Epanchin decisively. â\\x80\\x9cTalk, but not too\\r\\nloud, and donâ\\x80\\x99t excite yourself. You have made me sorry for you.\\r\\nPrince, you donâ\\x80\\x99t deserve that I should stay and have tea with you, yet\\r\\nI will, all the same, but I wonâ\\x80\\x99t apologize. I apologize to nobody!\\r\\nNobody! It is absurd! However, forgive me, prince, if I blew you\\r\\nupâ\\x80\\x94that is, if you like, of course. But please donâ\\x80\\x99t let me keep\\r\\nanyone,â\\x80\\x9d she added suddenly to her husband and daughters, in a tone of\\r\\nresentment, as though they had grievously offended her. â\\x80\\x9cI can come\\r\\nhome alone quite well.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut they did not let her finish, and gathered round her eagerly. The\\r\\nprince immediately invited everyone to stay for tea, and apologized for\\r\\nnot having thought of it before. The general murmured a few polite\\r\\nwords, and asked Lizabetha Prokofievna if she did not feel cold on the\\r\\nterrace. He very nearly asked Hippolyte how long he had been at the\\r\\nUniversity, but stopped himself in time. Evgenie Pavlovitch and Prince\\r\\nS. suddenly grew extremely gay and amiable. Adelaida and Alexandra had\\r\\nnot recovered from their surprise, but it was now mingled with\\r\\nsatisfaction; in short, everyone seemed very much relieved that\\r\\nLizabetha Prokofievna had got over her paroxysm. Aglaya alone still\\r\\nfrowned, and sat apart in silence. All the other guests stayed on as\\r\\nwell; no one wanted to go, not even General Ivolgin, but Lebedeff said\\r\\nsomething to him in passing which did not seem to please him, for he\\r\\nimmediately went and sulked in a corner. The prince took care to offer\\r\\ntea to Burdovsky and his friends as well as the rest. The invitation\\r\\nmade them rather uncomfortable. They muttered that they would wait for\\r\\nHippolyte, and went and sat by themselves in a distant corner of the\\r\\nverandah. Tea was served at once; Lebedeff had no doubt ordered it for\\r\\nhimself and his family before the others arrived. It was striking\\r\\neleven.\\r\\n\\r\\nX.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter moistening his lips with the tea which Vera Lebedeff brought him,\\r\\nHippolyte set the cup down on the table, and glanced round. He seemed\\r\\nconfused and almost at a loss.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cJust look, Lizabetha Prokofievna,â\\x80\\x9d he began, with a kind of feverish\\r\\nhaste; â\\x80\\x9cthese china cups are supposed to be extremely valuable.\\r\\nLebedeff always keeps them locked up in his china-cupboard; they were\\r\\npart of his wifeâ\\x80\\x99s dowry. Yet he has brought them out tonightâ\\x80\\x94in your\\r\\nhonour, of course! He is so pleasedâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d He was about to add something\\r\\nelse, but could not find the words.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere, he is feeling embarrassed; I expected as much,â\\x80\\x9d whispered\\r\\nEvgenie Pavlovitch suddenly in the princeâ\\x80\\x99s ear. â\\x80\\x9cIt is a bad sign;\\r\\nwhat do you think? Now, out of spite, he will come out with something\\r\\nso outrageous that even Lizabetha Prokofievna will not be able to stand\\r\\nit.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMuishkin looked at him inquiringly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou do not care if he does?â\\x80\\x9d added Evgenie Pavlovitch. â\\x80\\x9cNeither do I;\\r\\nin fact, I should be glad, merely as a proper punishment for our dear\\r\\nLizabetha Prokofievna. I am very anxious that she should get it,\\r\\nwithout delay, and I shall stay till she does. You seem feverish.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNever mind; by-and-by; yes, I am not feeling well,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince\\r\\nimpatiently, hardly listening. He had just heard Hippolyte mention his\\r\\nown name.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou donâ\\x80\\x99t believe it?â\\x80\\x9d said the invalid, with a nervous laugh. â\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t wonder, but the prince will have no difficulty in believing it;\\r\\nhe will not be at all surprised.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you hear, princeâ\\x80\\x94do you hear that?â\\x80\\x9d said Lizabetha Prokofievna,\\r\\nturning towards him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was laughter in the group around her, and Lebedeff stood before\\r\\nher gesticulating wildly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe declares that your humbug of a landlord revised this gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\narticleâ\\x80\\x94the article that was read aloud just nowâ\\x80\\x94in which you got such\\r\\na charming dressing-down.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince regarded Lebedeff with astonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy donâ\\x80\\x99t you say something?â\\x80\\x9d cried Lizabetha Prokofievna, stamping\\r\\nher foot.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell,â\\x80\\x9d murmured the prince, with his eyes still fixed on Lebedeff, â\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\ncan see now that he did.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs it true?â\\x80\\x9d she asked eagerly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAbsolutely, your excellency,â\\x80\\x9d said Lebedeff, without the least\\r\\nhesitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Epanchin almost sprang up in amazement at his answer, and at the\\r\\nassurance of his tone.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe actually seems to boast of it!â\\x80\\x9d she cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am baseâ\\x80\\x94base!â\\x80\\x9d muttered Lebedeff, beating his breast, and hanging\\r\\nhis head.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat do I care if you are base or not? He thinks he has only to say,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98I am base,â\\x80\\x99 and there is an end of it. As to you, prince, are you not\\r\\nashamed?â\\x80\\x94I repeat, are you not ashamed, to mix with such riff-raff? I\\r\\nwill never forgive you!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe prince will forgive me!â\\x80\\x9d said Lebedeff with emotional conviction.\\r\\n\\r\\nKeller suddenly left his seat, and approached Lizabetha Prokofievna.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was only out of generosity, madame,â\\x80\\x9d he said in a resonant voice,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand because I would not betray a friend in an awkward position, that I\\r\\ndid not mention this revision before; though you heard him yourself\\r\\nthreatening to kick us down the steps. To clear the matter up, I\\r\\ndeclare now that I did have recourse to his assistance, and that I paid\\r\\nhim six roubles for it. But I did not ask him to correct my style; I\\r\\nsimply went to him for information concerning the facts, of which I was\\r\\nignorant to a great extent, and which he was competent to give. The\\r\\nstory of the gaiters, the appetite in the Swiss professorâ\\x80\\x99s house, the\\r\\nsubstitution of fifty roubles for two hundred and fiftyâ\\x80\\x94all such\\r\\ndetails, in fact, were got from him. I paid him six roubles for them;\\r\\nbut he did not correct the style.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI must state that I only revised the first part of the article,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\ninterposed Lebedeff with feverish impatience, while laughter rose from\\r\\nall around him; â\\x80\\x9cbut we fell out in the middle over one idea, so I\\r\\nnever corrected the second part. Therefore I cannot be held responsible\\r\\nfor the numerous grammatical blunders in it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is all he thinks of!â\\x80\\x9d cried Lizabetha Prokofievna.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMay I ask when this article was revised?â\\x80\\x9d said Evgenie Pavlovitch to\\r\\nKeller.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYesterday morning,â\\x80\\x9d he replied, â\\x80\\x9cwe had an interview which we all gave\\r\\nour word of honour to keep secret.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe very time when he was cringing before you and making protestations\\r\\nof devotion! Oh, the mean wretches! I will have nothing to do with your\\r\\nPushkin, and your daughter shall not set foot in my house!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLizabetha Prokofievna was about to rise, when she saw Hippolyte\\r\\nlaughing, and turned upon him with irritation.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, sir, I suppose you wanted to make me look ridiculous?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeaven forbid!â\\x80\\x9d he answered, with a forced smile. â\\x80\\x9cBut I am more than\\r\\never struck by your eccentricity, Lizabetha Prokofievna. I admit that I\\r\\ntold you of Lebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s duplicity, on purpose. I knew the effect it\\r\\nwould have on you,â\\x80\\x94on you alone, for the prince will forgive him. He\\r\\nhas probably forgiven him already, and is racking his brains to find\\r\\nsome excuse for himâ\\x80\\x94is not that the truth, prince?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe gasped as he spoke, and his strange agitation seemed to increase.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell?â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Epanchin angrily, surprised at his tone; â\\x80\\x9cwell, what\\r\\nmore?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have heard many things of the kind about you...they delighted me...\\r\\nI have learned to hold you in the highest esteem,â\\x80\\x9d continued Hippolyte.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis words seemed tinged with a kind of sarcastic mockery, yet he was\\r\\nextremely agitated, casting suspicious glances around him, growing\\r\\nconfused, and constantly losing the thread of his ideas. All this,\\r\\ntogether with his consumptive appearance, and the frenzied expression\\r\\nof his blazing eyes, naturally attracted the attention of everyone\\r\\npresent.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI might have been surprised (though I admit I know nothing of the\\r\\nworld), not only that you should have stayed on just now in the company\\r\\nof such people as myself and my friends, who are not of your class, but\\r\\nthat you should let these... young ladies listen to such a scandalous\\r\\naffair, though no doubt novel-reading has taught them all there is to\\r\\nknow. I may be mistaken; I hardly know what I am saying; but surely no\\r\\none but you would have stayed to please a whippersnapper (yes, a\\r\\nwhippersnapper; I admit it) to spend the evening and take part in\\r\\neverythingâ\\x80\\x94only to be ashamed of it tomorrow. (I know I express myself\\r\\nbadly.) I admire and appreciate it all extremely, though the expression\\r\\non the face of his excellency, your husband, shows that he thinks it\\r\\nvery improper. He-he!â\\x80\\x9d He burst out laughing, and was seized with a fit\\r\\nof coughing which lasted for two minutes and prevented him from\\r\\nspeaking.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe has lost his breath now!â\\x80\\x9d said Lizabetha Prokofievna coldly,\\r\\nlooking at him with more curiosity than pity: â\\x80\\x9cCome, my dear boy, that\\r\\nis quite enoughâ\\x80\\x94let us make an end of this.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIvan Fedorovitch, now quite out of patience, interrupted suddenly. â\\x80\\x9cLet\\r\\nme remark in my turn, sir,â\\x80\\x9d he said in tones of deep annoyance, â\\x80\\x9cthat\\r\\nmy wife is here as the guest of Prince Lef Nicolaievitch, our friend\\r\\nand neighbour, and that in any case, young man, it is not for you to\\r\\npass judgment on the conduct of Lizabetha Prokofievna, or to make\\r\\nremarks aloud in my presence concerning what feelings you think may be\\r\\nread in my face. Yes, my wife stayed here,â\\x80\\x9d continued the general, with\\r\\nincreasing irritation, â\\x80\\x9cmore out of amazement than anything else.\\r\\nEveryone can understand that a collection of such strange young men\\r\\nwould attract the attention of a person interested in contemporary\\r\\nlife. I stayed myself, just as I sometimes stop to look on in the\\r\\nstreet when I see something that may be regarded as-as-as-â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAs a curiosity,â\\x80\\x9d suggested Evgenie Pavlovitch, seeing his excellency\\r\\ninvolved in a comparison which he could not complete.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is exactly the word I wanted,â\\x80\\x9d said the general with\\r\\nsatisfactionâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9ca curiosity. However, the most astonishing and, if I may\\r\\nso express myself, the most painful, thing in this matter, is that you\\r\\ncannot even understand, young man, that Lizabetha Prokofievna, only\\r\\nstayed with you because you are ill,â\\x80\\x94if you really are dyingâ\\x80\\x94moved by\\r\\nthe pity awakened by your plaintive appeal, and that her name,\\r\\ncharacter, and social position place her above all risk of\\r\\ncontamination. Lizabetha Prokofievna!â\\x80\\x9d he continued, now crimson with\\r\\nrage, â\\x80\\x9cif you are coming, we will say goodnight to the prince, andâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank you for the lesson, general,â\\x80\\x9d said Hippolyte, with unexpected\\r\\ngravity, regarding him thoughtfully.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTwo minutes more, if you please, dear Ivan Fedorovitch,â\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nLizabetha Prokofievna to her husband; â\\x80\\x9cit seems to me that he is in a\\r\\nfever and delirious; you can see by his eyes what a state he is in; it\\r\\nis impossible to let him go back to Petersburg tonight. Can you put him\\r\\nup, Lef Nicolaievitch? I hope you are not bored, dear prince,â\\x80\\x9d she\\r\\nadded suddenly to Prince S. â\\x80\\x9cAlexandra, my dear, come here! Your hair\\r\\nis coming down.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe arranged her daughterâ\\x80\\x99s hair, which was not in the least\\r\\ndisordered, and gave her a kiss. This was all that she had called her\\r\\nfor.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI thought you were capable of development,â\\x80\\x9d said Hippolyte, coming out\\r\\nof his fit of abstraction. â\\x80\\x9cYes, that is what I meant to say,â\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nadded, with the satisfaction of one who suddenly remembers something he\\r\\nhad forgotten. â\\x80\\x9cHere is Burdovsky, sincerely anxious to protect his\\r\\nmother; is not that so? And he himself is the cause of her disgrace.\\r\\nThe prince is anxious to help Burdovsky and offers him friendship and a\\r\\nlarge sum of money, in the sincerity of his heart. And here they stand\\r\\nlike two sworn enemiesâ\\x80\\x94ha, ha, ha! You all hate Burdovsky because his\\r\\nbehaviour with regard to his mother is shocking and repugnant to you;\\r\\ndo you not? Is not that true? Is it not true? You all have a passion\\r\\nfor beauty and distinction in outward forms; that is all you care for,\\r\\nisnâ\\x80\\x99t it? I have suspected for a long time that you cared for nothing\\r\\nelse! Well, let me tell you that perhaps there is not one of you who\\r\\nloved your mother as Burdovsky loved his. As to you, prince, I know\\r\\nthat you have sent money secretly to Burdovskyâ\\x80\\x99s mother through Gania.\\r\\nWell, I bet now,â\\x80\\x9d he continued with an hysterical laugh, â\\x80\\x9cthat\\r\\nBurdovsky will accuse you of indelicacy, and reproach you with a want\\r\\nof respect for his mother! Yes, that is quite certain! Ha, ha, ha!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe caught his breath, and began to cough once more.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome, that is enough! That is all now; you have no more to say? Now go\\r\\nto bed; you are burning with fever,â\\x80\\x9d said Lizabetha Prokofievna\\r\\nimpatiently. Her anxious eyes had never left the invalid. â\\x80\\x9cGood\\r\\nheavens, he is going to begin again!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are laughing, I think? Why do you keep laughing at me?â\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nHippolyte irritably to Evgenie Pavlovitch, who certainly was laughing.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI only want to know, Mr. Hippolyteâ\\x80\\x94excuse me, I forget your surname.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMr. Terentieff,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh yes, Mr. Terentieff. Thank you prince. I heard it just now, but had\\r\\nforgotten it. I want to know, Mr. Terentieff, if what I have heard\\r\\nabout you is true. It seems you are convinced that if you could speak\\r\\nto the people from a window for a quarter of an hour, you could make\\r\\nthem all adopt your views and follow you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI may have said so,â\\x80\\x9d answered Hippolyte, as if trying to remember.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I certainly said so,â\\x80\\x9d he continued with sudden animation, fixing\\r\\nan unflinching glance on his questioner. â\\x80\\x9cWhat of it?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNothing. I was only seeking further information, to put the finishing\\r\\ntouch.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEvgenie Pavlovitch was silent, but Hippolyte kept his eyes fixed upon\\r\\nhim, waiting impatiently for more.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, have you finished?â\\x80\\x9d said Lizabetha Prokofievna to Evgenie. â\\x80\\x9cMake\\r\\nhaste, sir; it is time he went to bed. Have you more to say?â\\x80\\x9d She was\\r\\nvery angry.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I have a little more,â\\x80\\x9d said Evgenie Pavlovitch, with a smile. â\\x80\\x9cIt\\r\\nseems to me that all you and your friends have said, Mr. Terentieff,\\r\\nand all you have just put forward with such undeniable talent, may be\\r\\nsummed up in the triumph of right above all, independent of everything\\r\\nelse, to the exclusion of everything else; perhaps even before having\\r\\ndiscovered what constitutes the right. I may be mistaken?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are certainly mistaken; I do not even understand you. What else?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMurmurs arose in the neighbourhood of Burdovsky and his companions;\\r\\nLebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s nephew protested under his breath.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have nearly finished,â\\x80\\x9d replied Evgenie Pavlovitch.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI will only remark that from these premises one could conclude that\\r\\nmight is rightâ\\x80\\x94I mean the right of the clenched fist, and of personal\\r\\ninclination. Indeed, the world has often come to that conclusion.\\r\\nPrudhon upheld that might is right. In the American War some of the\\r\\nmost advanced Liberals took sides with the planters on the score that\\r\\nthe blacks were an inferior race to the whites, and that might was the\\r\\nright of the white race.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou mean, no doubt, that you do not deny that might is right?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat then?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are at least logical. I would only point out that from the right\\r\\nof might, to the right of tigers and crocodiles, or even Daniloff and\\r\\nGorsky, is but a step.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know nothing about that; what else?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHippolyte was scarcely listening. He kept saying â\\x80\\x9cwell?â\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cwhat\\r\\nelse?â\\x80\\x9d mechanically, without the least curiosity, and by mere force of\\r\\nhabit.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, nothing else; that is all.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHowever, I bear you no grudge,â\\x80\\x9d said Hippolyte suddenly, and, hardly\\r\\nconscious of what he was doing, he held out his hand with a smile. The\\r\\ngesture took Evgenie Pavlovitch by surprise, but with the utmost\\r\\ngravity he touched the hand that was offered him in token of\\r\\nforgiveness.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI can but thank you,â\\x80\\x9d he said, in a tone too respectful to be sincere,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cfor your kindness in letting me speak, for I have often noticed that\\r\\nour Liberals never allow other people to have an opinion of their own,\\r\\nand immediately answer their opponents with abuse, if they do not have\\r\\nrecourse to arguments of a still more unpleasant nature.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat you say is quite true,â\\x80\\x9d observed General Epanchin; then, clasping\\r\\nhis hands behind his back, he returned to his place on the terrace\\r\\nsteps, where he yawned with an air of boredom.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome, sir, that will do; you weary me,â\\x80\\x9d said Lizabetha Prokofievna\\r\\nsuddenly to Evgenie Pavlovitch.\\r\\n\\r\\nHippolyte rose all at once, looking troubled and almost frightened.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is time for me to go,â\\x80\\x9d he said, glancing round in perplexity. â\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nhave detained you... I wanted to tell you everything... I thought you\\r\\nall... for the last time... it was a whim...â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe evidently had sudden fits of returning animation, when he awoke from\\r\\nhis semi-delirium; then, recovering full self-possession for a few\\r\\nmoments, he would speak, in disconnected phrases which had perhaps\\r\\nhaunted him for a long while on his bed of suffering, during weary,\\r\\nsleepless nights.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, good-bye,â\\x80\\x9d he said abruptly. â\\x80\\x9cYou think it is easy for me to say\\r\\ngood-bye to you? Ha, ha!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFeeling that his question was somewhat gauche, he smiled angrily. Then\\r\\nas if vexed that he could not ever express what he really meant, he\\r\\nsaid irritably, in a loud voice:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExcellency, I have the honour of inviting you to my funeral; that is,\\r\\nif you will deign to honour it with your presence. I invite you all,\\r\\ngentlemen, as well as the general.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe burst out laughing again, but it was the laughter of a madman.\\r\\nLizabetha Prokofievna approached him anxiously and seized his arm. He\\r\\nstared at her for a moment, still laughing, but soon his face grew\\r\\nserious.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you know that I came here to see those trees?â\\x80\\x9d pointing to the\\r\\ntrees in the park. â\\x80\\x9cIt is not ridiculous, is it? Say that it is not\\r\\nridiculous!â\\x80\\x9d he demanded urgently of Lizabetha Prokofievna. Then he\\r\\nseemed to be plunged in thought. A moment later he raised his head, and\\r\\nhis eyes sought for someone. He was looking for Evgenie Pavlovitch, who\\r\\nwas close by on his right as before, but he had forgotten this, and his\\r\\neyes ranged over the assembled company. â\\x80\\x9cAh! you have not gone!â\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nsaid, when he caught sight of him at last. â\\x80\\x9cYou kept on laughing just\\r\\nnow, because I thought of speaking to the people from the window for a\\r\\nquarter of an hour. But I am not eighteen, you know; lying on that bed,\\r\\nand looking out of that window, I have thought of all sorts of things\\r\\nfor such a long time that... a dead man has no age, you know. I was\\r\\nsaying that to myself only last week, when I was awake in the night. Do\\r\\nyou know what you fear most? You fear our sincerity more than anything,\\r\\nalthough you despise us! The idea crossed my mind that night... You\\r\\nthought I was making fun of you just now, Lizabetha Prokofievna? No,\\r\\nthe idea of mockery was far from me; I only meant to praise you. Colia\\r\\ntold me the prince called you a childâ\\x80\\x94very wellâ\\x80\\x94but let me see, I had\\r\\nsomething else to say...â\\x80\\x9d He covered his face with his hands and tried\\r\\nto collect his thoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, yesâ\\x80\\x94you were going away just now, and I thought to myself: â\\x80\\x98I\\r\\nshall never see these people againâ\\x80\\x94never again! This is the last time I\\r\\nshall see the trees, too. I shall see nothing after this but the red\\r\\nbrick wall of Meyerâ\\x80\\x99s house opposite my window. Tell them about itâ\\x80\\x94try\\r\\nto tell them,â\\x80\\x99 I thought. â\\x80\\x98Here is a beautiful young girlâ\\x80\\x94you are a\\r\\ndead man; make them understand that. Tell them that a dead man may say\\r\\nanythingâ\\x80\\x94and Mrs. Grundy will not be angryâ\\x80\\x94ha-ha! You are not\\r\\nlaughing?â\\x80\\x9d He looked anxiously around. â\\x80\\x9cBut you know I get so many\\r\\nqueer ideas, lying there in bed. I have grown convinced that nature is\\r\\nfull of mockeryâ\\x80\\x94you called me an atheist just now, but you know this\\r\\nnature... why are you laughing again? You are very cruel!â\\x80\\x9d he added\\r\\nsuddenly, regarding them all with mournful reproach. â\\x80\\x9cI have not\\r\\ncorrupted Colia,â\\x80\\x9d he concluded in a different and very serious tone, as\\r\\nif remembering something again.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNobody here is laughing at you. Calm yourself,â\\x80\\x9d said Lizabetha\\r\\nProkofievna, much moved. â\\x80\\x9cYou shall see a new doctor tomorrow; the\\r\\nother was mistaken; but sit down, do not stand like that! You are\\r\\ndeliriousâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d Oh, what shall we do with him she cried in anguish, as she\\r\\nmade him sit down again in the arm-chair.\\r\\n\\r\\nA tear glistened on her cheek. At the sight of it Hippolyte seemed\\r\\namazed. He lifted his hand timidly and, touched the tear with his\\r\\nfinger, smiling like a child.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI... you,â\\x80\\x9d he began joyfully. â\\x80\\x9cYou cannot tell how I... he always\\r\\nspoke so enthusiastically of you, Colia here; I liked his enthusiasm. I\\r\\nwas not corrupting him! But I must leave him, tooâ\\x80\\x94I wanted to leave\\r\\nthem allâ\\x80\\x94there was not one of themâ\\x80\\x94not one! I wanted to be a man of\\r\\nactionâ\\x80\\x94I had a right to be. Oh! what a lot of things I wanted! Now I\\r\\nwant nothing; I renounce all my wants; I swore to myself that I would\\r\\nwant nothing; let them seek the truth without me! Yes, nature is full\\r\\nof mockery! Whyâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94he continued with sudden warmthâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cdoes she create the\\r\\nchoicest beings only to mock at them? The only human being who is\\r\\nrecognized as perfect, when nature showed him to mankind, was given the\\r\\nmission to say things which have caused the shedding of so much blood\\r\\nthat it would have drowned mankind if it had all been shed at once! Oh!\\r\\nit is better for me to die! I should tell some dreadful lie too; nature\\r\\nwould so contrive it! I have corrupted nobody. I wanted to live for the\\r\\nhappiness of all men, to find and spread the truth. I used to look out\\r\\nof my window at the wall of Meyerâ\\x80\\x99s house, and say to myself that if I\\r\\ncould speak for a quarter of an hour I would convince the whole world,\\r\\nand now for once in my life I have come into contact with... youâ\\x80\\x94if not\\r\\nwith the others! And what is the result? Nothing! The sole result is\\r\\nthat you despise me! Therefore I must be a fool, I am useless, it is\\r\\ntime I disappeared! And I shall leave not even a memory! Not a sound,\\r\\nnot a trace, not a single deed! I have not spread a single truth!... Do\\r\\nnot laugh at the fool! Forget him! Forget him forever! I beseech you,\\r\\ndo not be so cruel as to remember! Do you know that if I were not\\r\\nconsumptive, I would kill myself?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThough he seemed to wish to say much more, he became silent. He fell\\r\\nback into his chair, and, covering his face with his hands, began to\\r\\nsob like a little child.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh! what on earth are we to do with him?â\\x80\\x9d cried Lizabetha Prokofievna.\\r\\nShe hastened to him and pressed his head against her bosom, while he\\r\\nsobbed convulsively.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome, come, come! There, you must not cry, that will do. You are a\\r\\ngood child! God will forgive you, because you knew no better. Come now,\\r\\nbe a man! You know presently you will be ashamed.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHippolyte raised his head with an effort, saying:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have little brothers and sisters, over there, poor avid innocent.\\r\\nShe will corrupt them! You are a saint! You are a child yourselfâ\\x80\\x94save\\r\\nthem! Snatch them from that... she is... it is shameful! Oh! help them!\\r\\nGod will repay you a hundredfold. For the love of God, for the love of\\r\\nChrist!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSpeak, Ivan Fedorovitch! What are we to do?â\\x80\\x9d cried Lizabetha\\r\\nProkofievna, irritably. â\\x80\\x9cPlease break your majestic silence! I tell\\r\\nyou, if you cannot come to some decision, I will stay here all night\\r\\nmyself. You have tyrannized over me enough, you autocrat!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe spoke angrily, and in great excitement, and expected an immediate\\r\\nreply. But in such a case, no matter how many are present, all prefer\\r\\nto keep silence: no one will take the initiative, but all reserve their\\r\\ncomments till afterwards. There were some presentâ\\x80\\x94Varvara Ardalionovna,\\r\\nfor instanceâ\\x80\\x94who would have willingly sat there till morning without\\r\\nsaying a word. Varvara had sat apart all the evening without opening\\r\\nher lips, but she listened to everything with the closest attention;\\r\\nperhaps she had her reasons for so doing.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear,â\\x80\\x9d said the general, â\\x80\\x9cit seems to me that a sick-nurse would be\\r\\nof more use here than an excitable person like you. Perhaps it would be\\r\\nas well to get some sober, reliable man for the night. In any case we\\r\\nmust consult the prince, and leave the patient to rest at once.\\r\\nTomorrow we can see what can be done for him.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is nearly midnight; we are going. Will he come with us, or is he to\\r\\nstay here?â\\x80\\x9d Doktorenko asked crossly of the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou can stay with him if you like,â\\x80\\x9d said Muishkin.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere is plenty of room here.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly, to the astonishment of all, Keller went quickly up to the\\r\\ngeneral.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExcellency,â\\x80\\x9d he said, impulsively, â\\x80\\x9cif you want a reliable man for the\\r\\nnight, I am ready to sacrifice myself for my friendâ\\x80\\x94such a soul as he\\r\\nhas! I have long thought him a great man, excellency! My article showed\\r\\nmy lack of education, but when he criticizes he scatters pearls!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIvan Fedorovitch turned from the boxer with a gesture of despair.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI shall be delighted if he will stay; it would certainly be difficult\\r\\nfor him to get back to Petersburg,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, in answer to the\\r\\neager questions of Lizabetha Prokofievna.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut you are half asleep, are you not? If you donâ\\x80\\x99t want him, I will\\r\\ntake him back to my house! Why, good gracious! He can hardly stand up\\r\\nhimself! What is it? Are you ill?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNot finding the prince on his death-bed, Lizabetha Prokofievna had been\\r\\nmisled by his appearance to think him much better than he was. But his\\r\\nrecent illness, the painful memories attached to it, the fatigue of\\r\\nthis evening, the incident with â\\x80\\x9cPavlicheffâ\\x80\\x99s son,â\\x80\\x9d and now this scene\\r\\nwith Hippolyte, had all so worked on his oversensitive nature that he\\r\\nwas now almost in a fever. Moreover, a new trouble, almost a fear,\\r\\nshowed itself in his eyes; he watched Hippolyte anxiously as if\\r\\nexpecting something further.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly Hippolyte arose. His face, shockingly pale, was that of a man\\r\\noverwhelmed with shame and despair. This was shown chiefly in the look\\r\\nof fear and hatred which he cast upon the assembled company, and in the\\r\\nwild smile upon his trembling lips. Then he cast down his eyes, and\\r\\nwith the same smile, staggered towards Burdovsky and Doktorenko, who\\r\\nstood at the entrance to the verandah. He had decided to go with them.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere! that is what I feared!â\\x80\\x9d cried the prince. â\\x80\\x9cIt was inevitable!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHippolyte turned upon him, a prey to maniacal rage, which set all the\\r\\nmuscles of his face quivering.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh! that is what you feared! It was inevitable, you say! Well, let me\\r\\ntell you that if I hate anyone hereâ\\x80\\x94I hate you all,â\\x80\\x9d he cried, in a\\r\\nhoarse, strained voiceâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cbut you, you, with your jesuitical soul, your\\r\\nsoul of sickly sweetness, idiot, beneficent millionaireâ\\x80\\x94I hate you\\r\\nworse than anything or anyone on earth! I saw through you and hated you\\r\\nlong ago; from the day I first heard of you. I hated you with my whole\\r\\nheart. You have contrived all this! You have driven me into this state!\\r\\nYou have made a dying man disgrace himself. You, you, you are the cause\\r\\nof my abject cowardice! I would kill you if I remained alive! I do not\\r\\nwant your benefits; I will accept none from anyone; do you hear? Not\\r\\nfrom any one! I want nothing! I was delirious, do not dare to triumph!\\r\\nI curse every one of you, once for all!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBreath failed him here, and he was obliged to stop.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe is ashamed of his tears!â\\x80\\x9d whispered Lebedeff to Lizabetha\\r\\nProkofievna. â\\x80\\x9cIt was inevitable. Ah! what a wonderful man the prince\\r\\nis! He read his very soul.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Mrs. Epanchin would not deign to look at Lebedeff. Drawn up\\r\\nhaughtily, with her head held high, she gazed at the â\\x80\\x9criff-raff,â\\x80\\x9d with\\r\\nscornful curiosity. When Hippolyte had finished, Ivan Fedorovitch\\r\\nshrugged his shoulders, and his wife looked him angrily up and down, as\\r\\nif to demand the meaning of his movement. Then she turned to the\\r\\nprince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThanks, prince, many thanks, eccentric friend of the family, for the\\r\\npleasant evening you have provided for us. I am sure you are quite\\r\\npleased that you have managed to mix us up with your extraordinary\\r\\naffairs. It is quite enough, dear family friend; thank you for giving\\r\\nus an opportunity of getting to know you so well.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe arranged her cloak with hands that trembled with anger as she\\r\\nwaited for the â\\x80\\x9criff-raffâ\\x80\\x9d to go. The cab which Lebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s son had gone\\r\\nto fetch a quarter of an hour ago, by Doktorenkoâ\\x80\\x99s order, arrived at\\r\\nthat moment. The general thought fit to put in a word after his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cReally, prince, I hardly expected afterâ\\x80\\x94after all our friendly\\r\\nintercourseâ\\x80\\x94and you see, Lizabetha Prokofievnaâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPapa, how can you?â\\x80\\x9d cried Adelaida, walking quickly up to the prince\\r\\nand holding out her hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe smiled absently at her; then suddenly he felt a burning sensation in\\r\\nhis ear as an angry voice whispered:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf you do not turn those dreadful people out of the house this very\\r\\ninstant, I shall hate you all my lifeâ\\x80\\x94all my life!â\\x80\\x9d It was Aglaya. She\\r\\nseemed almost in a frenzy, but she turned away before the prince could\\r\\nlook at her. However, there was no one left to turn out of the house,\\r\\nfor they had managed meanwhile to get Hippolyte into the cab, and it\\r\\nhad driven off.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, how much longer is this going to last, Ivan Fedorovitch? What do\\r\\nyou think? Shall I soon be delivered from these odious youths?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear, I am quite ready; naturally... the prince.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIvan Fedorovitch held out his hand to Muishkin, but ran after his wife,\\r\\nwho was leaving with every sign of violent indignation, before he had\\r\\ntime to shake it. Adelaida, her fiance, and Alexandra, said good-bye to\\r\\ntheir host with sincere friendliness. Evgenie Pavlovitch did the same,\\r\\nand he alone seemed in good spirits.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat I expected has happened! But I am sorry, you poor fellow, that\\r\\nyou should have had to suffer for it,â\\x80\\x9d he murmured, with a most\\r\\ncharming smile.\\r\\n\\r\\nAglaya left without saying good-bye. But the evening was not to end\\r\\nwithout a last adventure. An unexpected meeting was yet in store for\\r\\nLizabetha Prokofievna.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had scarcely descended the terrace steps leading to the high road\\r\\nthat skirts the park at Pavlofsk, when suddenly there dashed by a smart\\r\\nopen carriage, drawn by a pair of beautiful white horses. Having passed\\r\\nsome ten yards beyond the house, the carriage suddenly drew up, and one\\r\\nof the two ladies seated in it turned sharp round as though she had\\r\\njust caught sight of some acquaintance whom she particularly wished to\\r\\nsee.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEvgenie Pavlovitch! Is that you?â\\x80\\x9d cried a clear, sweet voice, which\\r\\ncaused the prince, and perhaps someone else, to tremble. â\\x80\\x9cWell, I _am_\\r\\nglad Iâ\\x80\\x99ve found you at last! Iâ\\x80\\x99ve sent to town for you twice today\\r\\nmyself! My messengers have been searching for you everywhere!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEvgenie Pavlovitch stood on the steps like one struck by lightning.\\r\\nMrs. Epanchin stood still too, but not with the petrified expression of\\r\\nEvgenie. She gazed haughtily at the audacious person who had addressed\\r\\nher companion, and then turned a look of astonishment upon Evgenie\\r\\nhimself.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s news!â\\x80\\x9d continued the clear voice. â\\x80\\x9cYou need not be anxious\\r\\nabout Kupferofâ\\x80\\x99s IOUâ\\x80\\x99sâ\\x80\\x94Rogojin has bought them up. I persuaded him\\r\\nto!â\\x80\\x94I dare say we shall settle Biscup too, so itâ\\x80\\x99s all right, you see!\\r\\n_Au revoir_, tomorrow! And donâ\\x80\\x99t worry!â\\x80\\x9d The carriage moved on, and\\r\\ndisappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe womanâ\\x80\\x99s mad!â\\x80\\x9d cried Evgenie, at last, crimson with anger, and\\r\\nlooking confusedly around. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know what sheâ\\x80\\x99s talking about! What\\r\\nIOUâ\\x80\\x99s? Who is she?â\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Epanchin continued to watch his face for a\\r\\ncouple of seconds; then she marched briskly and haughtily away towards\\r\\nher own house, the rest following her.\\r\\n\\r\\nA minute afterwards, Evgenie Pavlovitch reappeared on the terrace, in\\r\\ngreat agitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPrince,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9ctell me the truth; do you know what all this\\r\\nmeans?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know nothing whatever about it!â\\x80\\x9d replied the latter, who was,\\r\\nhimself, in a state of nervous excitement.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, nor do I!â\\x80\\x9d said Evgenie Pavlovitch, laughing suddenly. â\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nhavenâ\\x80\\x99t the slightest knowledge of any such IOUâ\\x80\\x99s as she mentioned, I\\r\\nswear I havenâ\\x80\\x99tâ\\x80\\x94Whatâ\\x80\\x99s the matter, are you fainting?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, noâ\\x80\\x94noâ\\x80\\x94Iâ\\x80\\x99m all right, I assure you!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nXI.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe anger of the Epanchin family was unappeased for three days. As\\r\\nusual the prince reproached himself, and had expected punishment, but\\r\\nhe was inwardly convinced that Lizabetha Prokofievna could not be\\r\\nseriously angry with him, and that she probably was more angry with\\r\\nherself. He was painfully surprised, therefore, when three days passed\\r\\nwith no word from her. Other things also troubled and perplexed him,\\r\\nand one of these grew more important in his eyes as the days went by.\\r\\nHe had begun to blame himself for two opposite tendenciesâ\\x80\\x94on the one\\r\\nhand to extreme, almost â\\x80\\x9csenseless,â\\x80\\x9d confidence in his fellows, on the\\r\\nother to a â\\x80\\x9cvile, gloomy suspiciousness.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the end of the third day the incident of the eccentric lady and\\r\\nEvgenie Pavlovitch had attained enormous and mysterious proportions in\\r\\nhis mind. He sorrowfully asked himself whether he had been the cause of\\r\\nthis new â\\x80\\x9cmonstrosity,â\\x80\\x9d or was it... but he refrained from saying who\\r\\nelse might be in fault. As for the letters N.P.B., he looked on that as\\r\\na harmless joke, a mere childish piece of mischiefâ\\x80\\x94so childish that he\\r\\nfelt it would be shameful, almost dishonourable, to attach any\\r\\nimportance to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day after these scandalous events, however, the prince had the\\r\\nhonour of receiving a visit from Adelaida and her fiance, Prince S.\\r\\nThey came, ostensibly, to inquire after his health. They had wandered\\r\\nout for a walk, and called in â\\x80\\x9cby accident,â\\x80\\x9d and talked for almost the\\r\\nwhole of the time they were with him about a certain most lovely tree\\r\\nin the park, which Adelaida had set her heart upon for a picture. This,\\r\\nand a little amiable conversation on Prince S.â\\x80\\x99s part, occupied the\\r\\ntime, and not a word was said about last eveningâ\\x80\\x99s episodes. At length\\r\\nAdelaida burst out laughing, apologized, and explained that they had\\r\\ncome incognito; from which, and from the circumstance that they said\\r\\nnothing about the princeâ\\x80\\x99s either walking back with them or coming to\\r\\nsee them later on, the latter inferred that he was in Mrs. Epanchinâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nblack books. Adelaida mentioned a watercolour that she would much like\\r\\nto show him, and explained that she would either send it by Colia, or\\r\\nbring it herself the next dayâ\\x80\\x94which to the prince seemed very\\r\\nsuggestive.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length, however, just as the visitors were on the point of\\r\\ndeparting, Prince S. seemed suddenly to recollect himself. â\\x80\\x9cOh yes,\\r\\nby-the-by,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cdo you happen to know, my dear Lef Nicolaievitch,\\r\\nwho that lady was who called out to Evgenie Pavlovitch last night, from\\r\\nthe carriage?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was Nastasia Philipovna,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince; â\\x80\\x9cdidnâ\\x80\\x99t you know that? I\\r\\ncannot tell you who her companion was.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut what on earth did she mean? I assure you it is a real riddle to\\r\\nmeâ\\x80\\x94to me, and to others, too!â\\x80\\x9d Prince S. seemed to be under the\\r\\ninfluence of sincere astonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe spoke of some bills of Evgenie Pavlovitchâ\\x80\\x99s,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince,\\r\\nsimply, â\\x80\\x9cwhich Rogojin had bought up from someone; and implied that\\r\\nRogojin would not press him.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, I heard that much, my dear fellow! But the thing is so impossibly\\r\\nabsurd! A man of property like Evgenie to give IOUâ\\x80\\x99s to a money-lender,\\r\\nand to be worried about them! It is ridiculous. Besides, he cannot\\r\\npossibly be on such intimate terms with Nastasia Philipovna as she gave\\r\\nus to understand; thatâ\\x80\\x99s the principal part of the mystery! He has\\r\\ngiven me his word that he knows nothing whatever about the matter, and\\r\\nof course I believe him. Well, the question is, my dear prince, do you\\r\\nknow anything about it? Has any sort of suspicion of the meaning of it\\r\\ncome across you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I know nothing whatever about it. I assure you I had nothing at\\r\\nall to do with it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, prince, how strange you have become! I assure you, I hardly know\\r\\nyou for your old self. How can you suppose that I ever suggested you\\r\\ncould have had a finger in such a business? But you are not quite\\r\\nyourself today, I can see.â\\x80\\x9d He embraced the prince, and kissed him.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean, though,â\\x80\\x9d asked Muishkin, â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98by such a businessâ\\x80\\x99? I\\r\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t see any particular â\\x80\\x98businessâ\\x80\\x99 about it at all!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, undoubtedly, this person wished somehow, and for some reason, to\\r\\ndo Evgenie Pavlovitch a bad turn, by attributing to himâ\\x80\\x94before\\r\\nwitnessesâ\\x80\\x94qualities which he neither has nor can have,â\\x80\\x9d replied Prince\\r\\nS. drily enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuiskhin looked disturbed, but continued to gaze intently and\\r\\nquestioningly into Prince S.â\\x80\\x99s face. The latter, however, remained\\r\\nsilent.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen it was not simply a matter of bills?â\\x80\\x9d Muishkin said at last, with\\r\\nsome impatience. â\\x80\\x9cIt was not as she said?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut I ask you, my dear sir, how can there be anything in common\\r\\nbetween Evgenie Pavlovitch, andâ\\x80\\x94her, and again Rogojin? I tell you he\\r\\nis a man of immense wealthâ\\x80\\x94as I know for a fact; and he has further\\r\\nexpectations from his uncle. Simply Nastasia Philipovnaâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPrince S. paused, as though unwilling to continue talking about\\r\\nNastasia Philipovna.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen at all events he knows her!â\\x80\\x9d remarked the prince, after a\\r\\nmomentâ\\x80\\x99s silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, that may be. He may have known her some time agoâ\\x80\\x94two or three\\r\\nyears, at least. He used to know Totski. But it is impossible that\\r\\nthere should be any intimacy between them. She has not even been in the\\r\\nplaceâ\\x80\\x94many people donâ\\x80\\x99t even know that she has returned from Moscow! I\\r\\nhave only observed her carriage about for the last three days or so.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a lovely carriage,â\\x80\\x9d said Adelaida.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, it was a beautiful turn-out, certainly!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe visitors left the house, however, on no less friendly terms than\\r\\nbefore. But the visit was of the greatest importance to the prince,\\r\\nfrom his own point of view. Admitting that he had his suspicions, from\\r\\nthe moment of the occurrence of last night, perhaps even before, that\\r\\nNastasia had some mysterious end in view, yet this visit confirmed his\\r\\nsuspicions and justified his fears. It was all clear to him; Prince S.\\r\\nwas wrong, perhaps, in his view of the matter, but he was somewhere\\r\\nnear the truth, and was right in so far as that he understood there to\\r\\nbe an intrigue of some sort going on. Perhaps Prince S. saw it all more\\r\\nclearly than he had allowed his hearers to understand. At all events,\\r\\nnothing could be plainer than that he and Adelaida had come for the\\r\\nexpress purpose of obtaining explanations, and that they suspected him\\r\\nof being concerned in the affair. And if all this were so, then _she_\\r\\nmust have some terrible object in view! What was it? There was no\\r\\nstopping _her_, as Muishkin knew from experience, in the performance of\\r\\nanything she had set her mind on! â\\x80\\x9cOh, she is mad, mad!â\\x80\\x9d thought the\\r\\npoor prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there were many other puzzling occurrences that day, which required\\r\\nimmediate explanation, and the prince felt very sad. A visit from Vera\\r\\nLebedeff distracted him a little. She brought the infant Lubotchka with\\r\\nher as usual, and talked cheerfully for some time. Then came her\\r\\nyounger sister, and later the brother, who attended a school close by.\\r\\nHe informed Muishkin that his father had lately found a new\\r\\ninterpretation of the star called â\\x80\\x9cwormwood,â\\x80\\x9d which fell upon the\\r\\nwater-springs, as described in the Apocalypse. He had decided that it\\r\\nmeant the network of railroads spread over the face of Europe at the\\r\\npresent time. The prince refused to believe that Lebedeff could have\\r\\ngiven such an interpretation, and they decided to ask him about it at\\r\\nthe earliest opportunity. Vera related how Keller had taken up his\\r\\nabode with them on the previous evening. She thought he would remain\\r\\nfor some time, as he was greatly pleased with the society of General\\r\\nIvolgin and of the whole family. But he declared that he had only come\\r\\nto them in order to complete his education! The prince always enjoyed\\r\\nthe company of Lebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s children, and today it was especially\\r\\nwelcome, for Colia did not appear all day. Early that morning he had\\r\\nstarted for Petersburg. Lebedeff also was away on business. But Gavrila\\r\\nArdalionovitch had promised to visit Muishkin, who eagerly awaited his\\r\\ncoming.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout seven in the evening, soon after dinner, he arrived. At the first\\r\\nglance it struck the prince that he, at any rate, must know all the\\r\\ndetails of last nightâ\\x80\\x99s affair. Indeed, it would have been impossible\\r\\nfor him to remain in ignorance considering the intimate relationship\\r\\nbetween him, Varvara Ardalionovna, and Ptitsin. But although he and the\\r\\nprince were intimate, in a sense, and although the latter had placed\\r\\nthe Burdovsky affair in his handsâ\\x80\\x94and this was not the only mark of\\r\\nconfidence he had receivedâ\\x80\\x94it seemed curious how many matters there\\r\\nwere that were tacitly avoided in their conversations. Muishkin thought\\r\\nthat Gania at times appeared to desire more cordiality and frankness.\\r\\nIt was apparent now, when he entered, that he was convinced that the\\r\\nmoment for breaking the ice between them had come at last.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut all the same Gania was in haste, for his sister was waiting at\\r\\nLebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s to consult him on an urgent matter of business. If he had\\r\\nanticipated impatient questions, or impulsive confidences, he was soon\\r\\nundeceived. The prince was thoughtful, reserved, even a little\\r\\nabsent-minded, and asked none of the questionsâ\\x80\\x94one in particularâ\\x80\\x94that\\r\\nGania had expected. So he imitated the princeâ\\x80\\x99s demeanour, and talked\\r\\nfast and brilliantly upon all subjects but the one on which their\\r\\nthoughts were engaged. Among other things Gania told his host that\\r\\nNastasia Philipovna had been only four days in Pavlofsk, and that\\r\\neveryone was talking about her already. She was staying with Daria\\r\\nAlexeyevna, in an ugly little house in Mattrossky Street, but drove\\r\\nabout in the smartest carriage in the place. A crowd of followers had\\r\\npursued her from the first, young and old. Some escorted her on\\r\\nhorse-back when she took the air in her carriage.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was as capricious as ever in the choice of her acquaintances, and\\r\\nadmitted few into her narrow circle. Yet she already had a numerous\\r\\nfollowing and many champions on whom she could depend in time of need.\\r\\nOne gentleman on his holiday had broken off his engagement on her\\r\\naccount, and an old general had quarrelled with his only son for the\\r\\nsame reason.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was accompanied sometimes in her carriage by a girl of sixteen, a\\r\\ndistant relative of her hostess. This young lady sang very well; in\\r\\nfact, her music had given a kind of notoriety to their little house.\\r\\nNastasia, however, was behaving with great discretion on the whole. She\\r\\ndressed quietly, though with such taste as to drive all the ladies in\\r\\nPavlofsk mad with envy, of that, as well as of her beauty and her\\r\\ncarriage and horses.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAs for yesterdayâ\\x80\\x99s episode,â\\x80\\x9d continued Gania, â\\x80\\x9cof course it was\\r\\npre-arranged.â\\x80\\x9d Here he paused, as though expecting to be asked how he\\r\\nknew that. But the prince did not inquire. Concerning Evgenie\\r\\nPavlovitch, Gania stated, without being asked, that he believed the\\r\\nformer had not known Nastasia Philipovna in past years, but that he had\\r\\nprobably been introduced to her by somebody in the park during these\\r\\nfour days. As to the question of the IOUâ\\x80\\x99s she had spoken of, there\\r\\nmight easily be something in that; for though Evgenie was undoubtedly a\\r\\nman of wealth, yet certain of his affairs were equally undoubtedly in\\r\\ndisorder. Arrived at this interesting point, Gania suddenly broke off,\\r\\nand said no more about Nastasiaâ\\x80\\x99s prank of the previous evening.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last Varvara Ardalionovna came in search of her brother, and\\r\\nremained for a few minutes. Without Muishkinâ\\x80\\x99s asking her, she informed\\r\\nhim that Evgenie Pavlovitch was spending the day in Petersburg, and\\r\\nperhaps would remain there over tomorrow; and that her husband had also\\r\\ngone to town, probably in connection with Evgenie Pavlovitchâ\\x80\\x99s affairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLizabetha Prokofievna is in a really fiendish temper today,â\\x80\\x9d she\\r\\nadded, as she went out, â\\x80\\x9cbut the most curious thing is that Aglaya has\\r\\nquarrelled with her whole family; not only with her father and mother,\\r\\nbut with her sisters also. It is not a good sign.â\\x80\\x9d She said all this\\r\\nquite casually, though it was extremely important in the eyes of the\\r\\nprince, and went off with her brother. Regarding the episode of\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPavlicheffâ\\x80\\x99s son,â\\x80\\x9d Gania had been absolutely silent, partly from a\\r\\nkind of false modesty, partly, perhaps, to â\\x80\\x9cspare the princeâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nfeelings.â\\x80\\x9d The latter, however, thanked him again for the trouble he\\r\\nhad taken in the affair.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuishkin was glad enough to be left alone. He went out of the garden,\\r\\ncrossed the road, and entered the park. He wished to reflect, and to\\r\\nmake up his mind as to a certain â\\x80\\x9cstep.â\\x80\\x9d This step was one of those\\r\\nthings, however, which are not thought out, as a rule, but decided for\\r\\nor against hastily, and without much reflection. The fact is, he felt a\\r\\nlonging to leave all this and go awayâ\\x80\\x94go anywhere, if only it were far\\r\\nenough, and at once, without bidding farewell to anyone. He felt a\\r\\npresentiment that if he remained but a few days more in this place, and\\r\\namong these people, he would be fixed there irrevocably and\\r\\npermanently. However, in a very few minutes he decided that to run away\\r\\nwas impossible; that it would be cowardly; that great problems lay\\r\\nbefore him, and that he had no right to leave them unsolved, or at\\r\\nleast to refuse to give all his energy and strength to the attempt to\\r\\nsolve them. Having come to this determination, he turned and went home,\\r\\nhis walk having lasted less than a quarter of an hour. At that moment\\r\\nhe was thoroughly unhappy.\\r\\n\\r\\nLebedeff had not returned, so towards evening Keller managed to\\r\\npenetrate into the princeâ\\x80\\x99s apartments. He was not drunk, but in a\\r\\nconfidential and talkative mood. He announced that he had come to tell\\r\\nthe story of his life to Muishkin, and had only remained at Pavlofsk\\r\\nfor that purpose. There was no means of turning him out; nothing short\\r\\nof an earthquake would have removed him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the manner of one with long hours before him, he began his history;\\r\\nbut after a few incoherent words he jumped to the conclusion, which was\\r\\nthat â\\x80\\x9chaving ceased to believe in God Almighty, he had lost every\\r\\nvestige of morality, and had gone so far as to commit a theft.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cCould\\r\\nyou imagine such a thing?â\\x80\\x9d said he.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cListen to me, Keller,â\\x80\\x9d returned the prince. â\\x80\\x9cIf I were in your place,\\r\\nI should not acknowledge that unless it were absolutely necessary for\\r\\nsome reason. But perhaps you are making yourself out to be worse than\\r\\nyou are, purposely?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI should tell it to no one but yourself, prince, and I only name it\\r\\nnow as a help to my soulâ\\x80\\x99s evolution. When I die, that secret will die\\r\\nwith me! But, excellency, if you knew, if you only had the least idea,\\r\\nhow difficult it is to get money nowadays! Where to find it is the\\r\\nquestion. Ask for a loan, the answer is always the same: â\\x80\\x98Give us gold,\\r\\njewels, or diamonds, and it will be quite easy.â\\x80\\x99 Exactly what one has\\r\\nnot got! Can you picture that to yourself? I got angry at last, and\\r\\nsaid, â\\x80\\x98I suppose you would accept emeralds?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Certainly, we accept\\r\\nemeralds with pleasure. Yes!â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Well, thatâ\\x80\\x99s all right,â\\x80\\x99 said I. â\\x80\\x98Go to\\r\\nthe devil, you den of thieves!â\\x80\\x99 And with that I seized my hat, and\\r\\nwalked out.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHad you any emeralds?â\\x80\\x9d asked the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat? I have emeralds? Oh, prince! with what simplicity, with what\\r\\nalmost pastoral simplicity, you look upon life!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nCould not something be made of this man under good influences? asked\\r\\nthe prince of himself, for he began to feel a kind of pity for his\\r\\nvisitor. He thought little of the value of his own personal influence,\\r\\nnot from a sense of humility, but from his peculiar way of looking at\\r\\nthings in general. Imperceptibly the conversation grew more animated\\r\\nand more interesting, so that neither of the two felt anxious to bring\\r\\nit to a close. Keller confessed, with apparent sincerity, to having\\r\\nbeen guilty of many acts of such a nature that it astonished the prince\\r\\nthat he could mention them, even to him. At every fresh avowal he\\r\\nprofessed the deepest repentance, and described himself as being\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbathed in tearsâ\\x80\\x9d; but this did not prevent him from putting on a\\r\\nboastful air at times, and some of his stories were so absurdly comical\\r\\nthat both he and the prince laughed like madmen.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOne point in your favour is that you seem to have a child-like mind,\\r\\nand extreme truthfulness,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince at last. â\\x80\\x9cDo you know that\\r\\nthat atones for much?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am assuredly noble-minded, and chivalrous to a degree!â\\x80\\x9d said Keller,\\r\\nmuch softened. â\\x80\\x9cBut, do you know, this nobility of mind exists in a\\r\\ndream, if one may put it so? It never appears in practice or deed. Now,\\r\\nwhy is that? I can never understand.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo not despair. I think we may say without fear of deceiving\\r\\nourselves, that you have now given a fairly exact account of your life.\\r\\nI, at least, think it would be impossible to add much to what you have\\r\\njust told me.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cImpossible?â\\x80\\x9d cried Keller, almost pityingly. â\\x80\\x9cOh prince, how little\\r\\nyou really seem to understand human nature!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs there really much more to be added?â\\x80\\x9d asked the prince, with mild\\r\\nsurprise. â\\x80\\x9cWell, what is it you really want of me? Speak out; tell me\\r\\nwhy you came to make your confession to me?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat did I want? Well, to begin with, it is good to meet a man like\\r\\nyou. It is a pleasure to talk over my faults with you. I know you for\\r\\none of the best of men... and then... then...â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe hesitated, and appeared so much embarrassed that the prince helped\\r\\nhim out.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen you wanted me to lend you money?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe words were spoken in a grave tone, and even somewhat shyly.\\r\\n\\r\\nKeller started, gave an astonished look at the speaker, and thumped the\\r\\ntable with his fist.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, prince, thatâ\\x80\\x99s enough to knock me down! It astounds me! Here you\\r\\nare, as simple and innocent as a knight of the golden age, and yet...\\r\\nyet... you read a manâ\\x80\\x99s soul like a psychologist! Now, do explain it to\\r\\nme, prince, because I... I really do not understand!... Of course, my\\r\\naim was to borrow money all along, and you... you asked the question as\\r\\nif there was nothing blameable in itâ\\x80\\x94as if you thought it quite\\r\\nnatural.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes... from you it is quite natural.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd you are not offended?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy should I be offended?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, just listen, prince. I remained here last evening, partly\\r\\nbecause I have a great admiration for the French archbishop Bourdaloue.\\r\\nI enjoyed a discussion over him till three oâ\\x80\\x99clock in the morning, with\\r\\nLebedeff; and then... thenâ\\x80\\x94I swear by all I hold sacred that I am\\r\\ntelling you the truthâ\\x80\\x94then I wished to develop my soul in this frank\\r\\nand heartfelt confession to you. This was my thought as I was sobbing\\r\\nmyself to sleep at dawn. Just as I was losing consciousness, tears in\\r\\nmy soul, tears on my face (I remember how I lay there sobbing), an idea\\r\\nfrom hell struck me. â\\x80\\x98Why not, after confessing, borrow money from\\r\\nhim?â\\x80\\x99 You see, this confession was a kind of masterstroke; I intended\\r\\nto use it as a means to your good grace and favourâ\\x80\\x94and thenâ\\x80\\x94then I\\r\\nmeant to walk off with a hundred and fifty roubles. Now, do you not\\r\\ncall that base?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is hardly an exact statement of the case,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince in\\r\\nreply. â\\x80\\x9cYou have confused your motives and ideas, as I need scarcely\\r\\nsay too often happens to myself. I can assure you, Keller, I reproach\\r\\nmyself bitterly for it sometimes. When you were talking just now I\\r\\nseemed to be listening to something about myself. At times I have\\r\\nimagined that all men were the same,â\\x80\\x9d he continued earnestly, for he\\r\\nappeared to be much interested in the conversation, â\\x80\\x9cand that consoled\\r\\nme in a certain degree, for a _double_ motive is a thing most difficult\\r\\nto fight against. I have tried, and I know. God knows whence they\\r\\narise, these ideas that you speak of as base. I fear these double\\r\\nmotives more than ever just now, but I am not your judge, and in my\\r\\nopinion it is going too far to give the name of baseness to itâ\\x80\\x94what do\\r\\nyou think? You were going to employ your tears as a ruse in order to\\r\\nborrow money, but you also sayâ\\x80\\x94in fact, you have sworn to the factâ\\x80\\x94that\\r\\nindependently of this your confession was made with an honourable\\r\\nmotive. As for the money, you want it for drink, do you not? After your\\r\\nconfession, that is weakness, of course; but, after all, how can anyone\\r\\ngive up a bad habit at a momentâ\\x80\\x99s notice? It is impossible. What can we\\r\\ndo? It is best, I think, to leave the matter to your own conscience.\\r\\nHow does it seem to you?â\\x80\\x9d As he concluded the prince looked curiously\\r\\nat Keller; evidently this problem of double motives had often been\\r\\nconsidered by him before.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, how anybody can call you an idiot after that, is more than I can\\r\\nunderstand!â\\x80\\x9d cried the boxer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince reddened slightly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBourdaloue, the archbishop, would not have spared a man like me,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nKeller continued, â\\x80\\x9cbut you, you have judged me with humanity. To show\\r\\nhow grateful I am, and as a punishment, I will not accept a hundred and\\r\\nfifty roubles. Give me twenty-fiveâ\\x80\\x94that will be enough; it is all I\\r\\nreally need, for a fortnight at least. I will not ask you for more for\\r\\na fortnight. I should like to have given Agatha a present, but she does\\r\\nnot really deserve it. Oh, my dear prince, God bless you!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this moment Lebedeff appeared, having just arrived from Petersburg.\\r\\nHe frowned when he saw the twenty-five rouble note in Kellerâ\\x80\\x99s hand,\\r\\nbut the latter, having got the money, went away at once. Lebedeff began\\r\\nto abuse him.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are unjust; I found him sincerely repentant,â\\x80\\x9d observed the prince,\\r\\nafter listening for a time.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat is the good of repentance like that? It is the same exactly as\\r\\nmine yesterday, when I said, â\\x80\\x98I am base, I am base,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x94words, and nothing\\r\\nmore!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen they were only words on your part? I thought, on the contrary...â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, I donâ\\x80\\x99t mind telling you the truthâ\\x80\\x94you only! Because you see\\r\\nthrough a man somehow. Words and actions, truth and falsehood, are all\\r\\njumbled up together in me, and yet I am perfectly sincere. I feel the\\r\\ndeepest repentance, believe it or not, as you choose; but words and\\r\\nlies come out in the infernal craving to get the better of other\\r\\npeople. It is always thereâ\\x80\\x94the notion of cheating people, and of using\\r\\nmy repentant tears to my own advantage! I assure you this is the truth,\\r\\nprince! I would not tell any other man for the world! He would laugh\\r\\nand jeer at meâ\\x80\\x94but you, you judge a man humanely.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, Keller said the same thing to me nearly word for word a few\\r\\nminutes ago!â\\x80\\x9d cried Muishkin. â\\x80\\x9cAnd you both seem inclined to boast\\r\\nabout it! You astonish me, but I think he is more sincere than you, for\\r\\nyou make a regular trade of it. Oh, donâ\\x80\\x99t put on that pathetic\\r\\nexpression, and donâ\\x80\\x99t put your hand on your heart! Have you anything to\\r\\nsay to me? You have not come for nothing...â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLebedeff grinned and wriggled.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have been waiting all day for you, because I want to ask you a\\r\\nquestion; and, for once in your life, please tell me the truth at once.\\r\\nHad you anything to do with that affair of the carriage yesterday?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLebedeff began to grin again, rubbed his hands, sneezed, but spoke not\\r\\na word in reply.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI see you had something to do with it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIndirectly, quite indirectly! I am speaking the truthâ\\x80\\x94I am indeed! I\\r\\nmerely told a certain person that I had people in my house, and that\\r\\nsuch and such personages might be found among them.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am aware that you sent your son to that houseâ\\x80\\x94he told me so himself\\r\\njust now, but what is this intrigue?â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, impatiently.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is not my intrigue!â\\x80\\x9d cried Lebedeff, waving his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was engineered by other people, and is, properly speaking, rather a\\r\\nfantasy than an intrigue!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut what is it all about? Tell me, for Heavenâ\\x80\\x99s sake! Cannot you\\r\\nunderstand how nearly it touches me? Why are they blackening Evgenie\\r\\nPavlovitchâ\\x80\\x99s reputation?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLebedeff grimaced and wriggled again.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPrince!â\\x80\\x9d said he. â\\x80\\x9cExcellency! You wonâ\\x80\\x99t let me tell you the whole\\r\\ntruth; I have tried to explain; more than once I have begun, but you\\r\\nhave not allowed me to go on...â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince gave no answer, and sat deep in thought. Evidently he was\\r\\nstruggling to decide.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery well! Tell me the truth,â\\x80\\x9d he said, dejectedly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAglaya Ivanovna...â\\x80\\x9d began Lebedeff, promptly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBe silent! At once!â\\x80\\x9d interrupted the prince, red with indignation, and\\r\\nperhaps with shame, too. â\\x80\\x9cIt is impossible and absurd! All that has\\r\\nbeen invented by you, or fools like you! Let me never hear you say a\\r\\nword again on that subject!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLate in the evening Colia came in with a whole budget of Petersburg and\\r\\nPavlofsk news. He did not dwell much on the Petersburg part of it,\\r\\nwhich consisted chiefly of intelligence about his friend Hippolyte, but\\r\\npassed quickly to the Pavlofsk tidings. He had gone straight to the\\r\\nEpanchinsâ\\x80\\x99 from the station.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s the deuce and all going on there!â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cFirst of all\\r\\nabout the row last night, and I think there must be something new as\\r\\nwell, though I didnâ\\x80\\x99t like to ask. Not a word about _you_, prince, the\\r\\nwhole time! The most interesting fact was that Aglaya had been\\r\\nquarrelling with her people about Gania. Colia did not know any\\r\\ndetails, except that it had been a terrible quarrel! Also Evgenie\\r\\nPavlovitch had called, and met with an excellent reception all round.\\r\\nAnd another curious thing: Mrs. Epanchin was so angry that she called\\r\\nVaria to herâ\\x80\\x94Varia was talking to the girlsâ\\x80\\x94and turned her out of the\\r\\nhouse â\\x80\\x98once for allâ\\x80\\x99 she said. I heard it from Varia herselfâ\\x80\\x94Mrs.\\r\\nEpanchin was quite polite, but firm; and when Varia said good-bye to\\r\\nthe girls, she told them nothing about it, and they didnâ\\x80\\x99t know they\\r\\nwere saying goodbye for the last time. Iâ\\x80\\x99m sorry for Varia, and for\\r\\nGania too; he isnâ\\x80\\x99t half a bad fellow, in spite of his faults, and I\\r\\nshall never forgive myself for not liking him before! I donâ\\x80\\x99t know\\r\\nwhether I ought to continue to go to the Epanchinsâ\\x80\\x99 now,â\\x80\\x9d concluded\\r\\nColiaâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cI like to be quite independent of others, and of other peopleâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nquarrels if I can; but I must think over it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t think you need break your heart over Gania,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince;\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cfor if what you say is true, he must be considered dangerous in the\\r\\nEpanchin household, and if so, certain hopes of his must have been\\r\\nencouraged.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat? What hopes?â\\x80\\x9d cried Colia; â\\x80\\x9cyou surely donâ\\x80\\x99t mean Aglaya?â\\x80\\x94oh,\\r\\nno!â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re a dreadful sceptic, prince,â\\x80\\x9d he continued, after a momentâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nsilence. â\\x80\\x9cI have observed of late that you have grown sceptical about\\r\\neverything. You donâ\\x80\\x99t seem to believe in people as you did, and are\\r\\nalways attributing motives and so onâ\\x80\\x94am I using the word â\\x80\\x98scepticâ\\x80\\x99 in\\r\\nits proper sense?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI believe so; but Iâ\\x80\\x99m not sure.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll change it, right or wrong; Iâ\\x80\\x99ll say that you are not\\r\\nsceptical, but _jealous_. There! you are deadly jealous of Gania, over\\r\\na certain proud damsel! Come!â\\x80\\x9d Colia jumped up, with these words, and\\r\\nburst out laughing. He laughed as he had perhaps never laughed before,\\r\\nand still more when he saw the prince flushing up to his temples. He\\r\\nwas delighted that the prince should be jealous about Aglaya. However,\\r\\nhe stopped immediately on seeing that the other was really hurt, and\\r\\nthe conversation continued, very earnestly, for an hour or more.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext day the prince had to go to town, on business. Returning in the\\r\\nafternoon, he happened upon General Epanchin at the station. The latter\\r\\nseized his hand, glancing around nervously, as if he were afraid of\\r\\nbeing caught in wrong-doing, and dragged him into a first-class\\r\\ncompartment. He was burning to speak about something of importance.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn the first place, my dear prince, donâ\\x80\\x99t be angry with me. I would\\r\\nhave come to see you yesterday, but I didnâ\\x80\\x99t know how Lizabetha\\r\\nProkofievna would take it. My dear fellow, my house is simply a hell\\r\\njust now, a sort of sphinx has taken up its abode there. We live in an\\r\\natmosphere of riddles; I canâ\\x80\\x99t make head or tail of anything. As for\\r\\nyou, I feel sure you are the least to blame of any of us, though you\\r\\ncertainly have been the cause of a good deal of trouble. You see, itâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nall very pleasant to be a philanthropist; but it can be carried too\\r\\nfar. Of course I admire kind-heartedness, and I esteem my wife, butâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general wandered on in this disconnected way for a long time; it\\r\\nwas clear that he was much disturbed by some circumstance which he\\r\\ncould make nothing of.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is plain to me, that _you_ are not in it at all,â\\x80\\x9d he continued, at\\r\\nlast, a little less vaguely, â\\x80\\x9cbut perhaps you had better not come to\\r\\nour house for a little while. I ask you in the friendliest manner,\\r\\nmind; just till the wind changes again. As for Evgenie Pavlovitch,â\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\ncontinued with some excitement, â\\x80\\x9cthe whole thing is a calumny, a dirty\\r\\ncalumny. It is simply a plot, an intrigue, to upset our plans and to\\r\\nstir up a quarrel. You see, prince, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you privately, Evgenie\\r\\nand ourselves have not said a word yet, we have no formal\\r\\nunderstanding, we are in no way bound on either side, but the word may\\r\\nbe said very soon, donâ\\x80\\x99t you see, _very_ soon, and all this is most\\r\\ninjurious, and is meant to be so. Why? Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure I canâ\\x80\\x99t tell you. Sheâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nan extraordinary woman, you see, an eccentric woman; I tell you I am so\\r\\nfrightened of that woman that I canâ\\x80\\x99t sleep. What a carriage that was,\\r\\nand where did it come from, eh? I declare, I was base enough to suspect\\r\\nEvgenie at first; but it seems certain that that cannot be the case,\\r\\nand if so, why is she interfering here? Thatâ\\x80\\x99s the riddle, what does\\r\\nshe want? Is it to keep Evgenie to herself? But, my dear fellow, I\\r\\nswear to you, I swear he doesnâ\\x80\\x99t even _know_ her, and as for those\\r\\nbills, why, the whole thing is an invention! And the familiarity of the\\r\\nwoman! Itâ\\x80\\x99s quite clear we must treat the impudent creatureâ\\x80\\x99s attempt\\r\\nwith disdain, and redouble our courtesy towards Evgenie. I told my wife\\r\\nso.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow Iâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you my secret conviction. Iâ\\x80\\x99m certain that sheâ\\x80\\x99s doing\\r\\nthis to revenge herself on me, on account of the past, though I assure\\r\\nyou that all the time I was blameless. I blush at the very idea. And\\r\\nnow she turns up again like this, when I thought she had finally\\r\\ndisappeared! Whereâ\\x80\\x99s Rogojin all this time? I thought she was Mrs.\\r\\nRogojin, long ago.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old man was in a state of great mental perturbation. The whole of\\r\\nthe journey, which occupied nearly an hour, he continued in this\\r\\nstrain, putting questions and answering them himself, shrugging his\\r\\nshoulders, pressing the princeâ\\x80\\x99s hand, and assuring the latter that, at\\r\\nall events, he had no suspicion whatever of _him_. This last assurance\\r\\nwas satisfactory, at all events. The general finished by informing him\\r\\nthat Evgenieâ\\x80\\x99s uncle was head of one of the civil service departments,\\r\\nand rich, very rich, and a gourmand. â\\x80\\x9cAnd, well, Heaven preserve him,\\r\\nof courseâ\\x80\\x94but Evgenie gets his money, donâ\\x80\\x99t you see? But, for all this,\\r\\nIâ\\x80\\x99m uncomfortable, I donâ\\x80\\x99t know why. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s something in the air, I\\r\\nfeel thereâ\\x80\\x99s something nasty in the air, like a bat, and Iâ\\x80\\x99m by no\\r\\nmeans comfortable.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it was not until the third day that the formal reconciliation\\r\\nbetween the prince and the Epanchins took place, as said before.\\r\\n\\r\\nXII.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was seven in the evening, and the prince was just preparing to go\\r\\nout for a walk in the park, when suddenly Mrs. Epanchin appeared on the\\r\\nterrace.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn the first place, donâ\\x80\\x99t dare to suppose,â\\x80\\x9d she began, â\\x80\\x9cthat I am\\r\\ngoing to apologize. Nonsense! You were entirely to blame.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince remained silent.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWere you to blame, or not?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, certainly not, no more than yourself, though at first I thought I\\r\\nwas.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, very well, letâ\\x80\\x99s sit down, at all events, for I donâ\\x80\\x99t intend to\\r\\nstand up all day. And remember, if you say, one word about â\\x80\\x98mischievous\\r\\nurchins,â\\x80\\x99 I shall go away and break with you altogether. Now then, did\\r\\nyou, or did you not, send a letter to Aglaya, a couple of months or so\\r\\nago, about Easter-tide?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat for? What was your object? Show me the letter.â\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Epanchinâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\neyes flashed; she was almost trembling with impatience.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have not got the letter,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, timidly, extremely\\r\\nsurprised at the turn the conversation had taken. â\\x80\\x9cIf anyone has it, if\\r\\nit still exists, Aglaya Ivanovna must have it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo finessing, please. What did you write about?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am not finessing, and I am not in the least afraid of telling you;\\r\\nbut I donâ\\x80\\x99t see the slightest reason why I should not have written.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBe quiet, you can talk afterwards! What was the letter about? Why are\\r\\nyou blushing?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince was silent. At last he spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t understand your thoughts, Lizabetha Prokofievna; but I can see\\r\\nthat the fact of my having written is for some reason repugnant to you.\\r\\nYou must admit that I have a perfect right to refuse to answer your\\r\\nquestions; but, in order to show you that I am neither ashamed of the\\r\\nletter, nor sorry that I wrote it, and that I am not in the least\\r\\ninclined to blush about itâ\\x80\\x9d (here the princeâ\\x80\\x99s blushes redoubled), â\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nwill repeat the substance of my letter, for I think I know it almost by\\r\\nheart.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo saying, the prince repeated the letter almost word for word, as he\\r\\nhad written it.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy goodness, what utter twaddle, and what may all this nonsense have\\r\\nsignified, pray? If it had any meaning at all!â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Epanchin,\\r\\ncuttingly, after having listened with great attention.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI really donâ\\x80\\x99t absolutely know myself; I know my feeling was very\\r\\nsincere. I had moments at that time full of life and hope.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat sort of hope?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is difficult to explain, but certainly not the hopes you have in\\r\\nyour mind. Hopesâ\\x80\\x94well, in a word, hopes for the future, and a feeling\\r\\nof joy that _there_, at all events, I was not entirely a stranger and a\\r\\nforeigner. I felt an ecstasy in being in my native land once more; and\\r\\none sunny morning I took up a pen and wrote her that letter, but why to\\r\\n_her_, I donâ\\x80\\x99t quite know. Sometimes one longs to have a friend near,\\r\\nand I evidently felt the need of one then,â\\x80\\x9d added the prince, and\\r\\npaused.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAre you in love with her?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cN-no! I wrote to her as to a sister; I signed myself her brother.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh yes, of course, on purpose! I quite understand.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is very painful to me to answer these questions, Lizabetha\\r\\nProkofievna.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI dare say it is; but thatâ\\x80\\x99s no affair of mine. Now then, assure me\\r\\ntruly as before Heaven, are you lying to me or not?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I am not lying.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAre you telling the truth when you say you are not in love?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI believe it is the absolute truth.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98I believe,â\\x80\\x99 indeed! Did that mischievous urchin give it to her?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI asked Nicolai Ardalionovitch...â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe urchin! the urchin!â\\x80\\x9d interrupted Lizabetha Prokofievna in an angry\\r\\nvoice. â\\x80\\x9cI do not want to know if it were Nicolai Ardalionovitch! The\\r\\nurchin!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNicolai Ardalionovitch...â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe urchin, I tell you!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, it was not the urchin: it was Nicolai Ardalionovitch,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\r\\nprince very firmly, but without raising his voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, all right! All right, my dear! I shall put that down to your\\r\\naccount.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was silent a moment to get breath, and to recover her composure.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell!â\\x80\\x94and whatâ\\x80\\x99s the meaning of the â\\x80\\x98poor knight,â\\x80\\x99 eh?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know in the least; I wasnâ\\x80\\x99t present when the joke was made. It\\r\\n_is_ a joke. I suppose, and thatâ\\x80\\x99s all.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, thatâ\\x80\\x99s a comfort, at all events. You donâ\\x80\\x99t suppose she could\\r\\ntake any interest in you, do you? Why, she called you an â\\x80\\x98idiotâ\\x80\\x99\\r\\nherself.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think you might have spared me that,â\\x80\\x9d murmured the prince\\r\\nreproachfully, almost in a whisper.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t be angry; she is a wilful, mad, spoilt girl. If she likes a\\r\\nperson she will pitch into him, and chaff him. I used to be just such\\r\\nanother. But for all that you neednâ\\x80\\x99t flatter yourself, my boy; she is\\r\\nnot for you. I donâ\\x80\\x99t believe it, and it is not to be. I tell you so at\\r\\nonce, so that you may take proper precautions. Now, I want to hear you\\r\\nswear that you are not married to that woman?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLizabetha Prokofievna, what are you thinking of?â\\x80\\x9d cried the prince,\\r\\nalmost leaping to his feet in amazement.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy? You very nearly were, anyhow.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYesâ\\x80\\x94I nearly was,â\\x80\\x9d whispered the prince, hanging his head.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell then, have you come here for _her?_ Are you in love with _her?_\\r\\nWith _that_ creature?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI did not come to marry at all,â\\x80\\x9d replied the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs there anything you hold sacred?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere is.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen swear by it that you did not come here to marry _her!_â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll swear it by whatever you please.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI believe you. You may kiss me; I breathe freely at last. But you must\\r\\nknow, my dear friend, Aglaya does not love you, and she shall never be\\r\\nyour wife while I am out of my grave. So be warned in time. Do you hear\\r\\nme?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I hear.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince flushed up so much that he could not look her in the face.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have waited for you with the greatest impatience (not that you were\\r\\nworth it). Every night I have drenched my pillow with tears, not for\\r\\nyou, my friend, not for you, donâ\\x80\\x99t flatter yourself! I have my own\\r\\ngrief, always the same, always the same. But Iâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you why I have\\r\\nbeen awaiting you so impatiently, because I believe that Providence\\r\\nitself sent you to be a friend and a brother to me. I havenâ\\x80\\x99t a friend\\r\\nin the world except Princess Bielokonski, and she is growing as stupid\\r\\nas a sheep from old age. Now then, tell me, yes or no? Do you know why\\r\\nshe called out from her carriage the other night?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI give you my word of honour that I had nothing to do with the matter\\r\\nand know nothing about it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery well, I believe you. I have my own ideas about it. Up to\\r\\nyesterday morning I thought it was really Evgenie Pavlovitch who was to\\r\\nblame; now I cannot help agreeing with the others. But why he was made\\r\\nsuch a fool of I cannot understand. However, he is not going to marry\\r\\nAglaya, I can tell you that. He may be a very excellent fellow, butâ\\x80\\x94so\\r\\nit shall be. I was not at all sure of accepting him before, but now I\\r\\nhave quite made up my mind that I wonâ\\x80\\x99t have him. â\\x80\\x98Put me in my coffin\\r\\nfirst and then into my grave, and then you may marry my daughter to\\r\\nwhomsoever you please,â\\x80\\x99 so I said to the general this very morning. You\\r\\nsee how I trust you, my boy.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I see and understand.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Epanchin gazed keenly into the princeâ\\x80\\x99s eyes. She was anxious to\\r\\nsee what impression the news as to Evgenie Pavlovitch had made upon\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you know anything about Gavrila Ardalionovitch?â\\x80\\x9d she asked at last.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh yes, I know a good deal.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDid you know he had communications with Aglaya?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I didnâ\\x80\\x99t,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, trembling a little, and in great\\r\\nagitation. â\\x80\\x9cYou say Gavrila Ardalionovitch has private communications\\r\\nwith Aglaya?â\\x80\\x94Impossible!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOnly quite lately. His sister has been working like a rat to clear the\\r\\nway for him all the winter.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t believe it!â\\x80\\x9d said the prince abruptly, after a short pause.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHad it been so I should have known long ago.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, of course, yes; he would have come and wept out his secret on your\\r\\nbosom. Oh, you simpletonâ\\x80\\x94you simpleton! Anyone can deceive you and take\\r\\nyou in like aâ\\x80\\x94like a,â\\x80\\x94arenâ\\x80\\x99t you ashamed to trust him? Canâ\\x80\\x99t you see\\r\\nthat he humbugs you just as much as ever he pleases?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know very well that he does deceive me occasionally, and he knows\\r\\nthat I know it, butâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d The prince did not finish his sentence.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd thatâ\\x80\\x99s why you trust him, eh? So I should have supposed. Good\\r\\nLord, was there ever such a man as you? Tfu! and are you aware, sir,\\r\\nthat this Gania, or his sister Varia, have brought her into\\r\\ncorrespondence with Nastasia Philipovna?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBrought whom?â\\x80\\x9d cried Muishkin.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAglaya.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t believe it! Itâ\\x80\\x99s impossible! What object could they have?â\\x80\\x9d He\\r\\njumped up from his chair in his excitement.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNor do I believe it, in spite of the proofs. The girl is self-willed\\r\\nand fantastic, and insane! Sheâ\\x80\\x99s wicked, wicked! Iâ\\x80\\x99ll repeat it for a\\r\\nthousand years that sheâ\\x80\\x99s wicked; they _all_ are, just now, all my\\r\\ndaughters, even that â\\x80\\x98wet henâ\\x80\\x99 Alexandra. And yet I donâ\\x80\\x99t believe it.\\r\\nBecause I donâ\\x80\\x99t choose to believe it, perhaps; but I donâ\\x80\\x99t. Why havenâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nyou been?â\\x80\\x9d she turned on the prince suddenly. â\\x80\\x9cWhy didnâ\\x80\\x99t you come near\\r\\nus all these three days, eh?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince began to give his reasons, but she interrupted him again.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEverybody takes you in and deceives you; you went to town yesterday. I\\r\\ndare swear you went down on your knees to that rogue, and begged him to\\r\\naccept your ten thousand roubles!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI never thought of doing any such thing. I have not seen him, and he\\r\\nis not a rogue, in my opinion. I have had a letter from him.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShow it me!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince took a paper from his pocket-book, and handed it to\\r\\nLizabetha Prokofievna. It ran as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSir,\\r\\n    â\\x80\\x9cIn the eyes of the world I am sure that I have no cause for pride\\r\\n    or self-esteem. I am much too insignificant for that. But what may\\r\\n    be so to other menâ\\x80\\x99s eyes is not so to yours. I am convinced that\\r\\n    you are better than other people. Doktorenko disagrees with me, but\\r\\n    I am content to differ from him on this point. I will never accept\\r\\n    one single copeck from you, but you have helped my mother, and I am\\r\\n    bound to be grateful to you for that, however weak it may seem. At\\r\\n    any rate, I have changed my opinion about you, and I think right to\\r\\n    inform you of the fact; but I also suppose that there can be no\\r\\n    further intercourse between us.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAntip Burdovsky.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cP.S.â\\x80\\x94The two hundred roubles I owe you shall certainly be repaid in\\r\\ntime.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow extremely stupid!â\\x80\\x9d cried Mrs. Epanchin, giving back the letter\\r\\nabruptly. â\\x80\\x9cIt was not worth the trouble of reading. Why are you\\r\\nsmiling?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cConfess that you are pleased to have read it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat! Pleased with all that nonsense! Why, cannot you see that they\\r\\nare all infatuated with pride and vanity?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe has acknowledged himself to be in the wrong. Donâ\\x80\\x99t you see that the\\r\\ngreater his vanity, the more difficult this admission must have been on\\r\\nhis part? Oh, what a little child you are, Lizabetha Prokofievna!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAre you tempting me to box your ears for you, or what?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot at all. I am only proving that you are glad about the letter. Why\\r\\nconceal your real feelings? You always like to do it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNever come near my house again!â\\x80\\x9d cried Mrs. Epanchin, pale with rage.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t let me see as much as a _shadow_ of you about the place! Do you\\r\\nhear?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh yes, and in three days youâ\\x80\\x99ll come and invite me yourself. Arenâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nyou ashamed now? These are your best feelings; you are only tormenting\\r\\nyourself.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll die before I invite you! I shall forget your very name! Iâ\\x80\\x99ve\\r\\nforgotten it already!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe marched towards the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut Iâ\\x80\\x99m forbidden your house as it is, without your added threats!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\ncried the prince after her.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat? Who forbade you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe turned round so suddenly that one might have supposed a needle had\\r\\nbeen stuck into her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince hesitated. He perceived that he had said too much now.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Who_ forbade you?â\\x80\\x9d cried Mrs. Epanchin once more.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAglaya Ivanovna told meâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen? Speakâ\\x80\\x94quick!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe sent to say, yesterday morning, that I was never to dare to come\\r\\nnear the house again.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLizabetha Prokofievna stood like a stone.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat did she send? Whom? Was it that boy? Was it a message?â\\x80\\x94quick!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI had a note,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhere is it? Give it here, at once.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince thought a moment. Then he pulled out of his waistcoat pocket\\r\\nan untidy slip of paper, on which was scrawled:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPRINCE LEF NICOLAIEVITCH,â\\x80\\x94If you think fit, after all that has passed,\\r\\nto honour our house with a visit, I can assure you you will not find me\\r\\namong the number of those who are in any way delighted to see you.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAglaya Epanchin.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Epanchin reflected a moment. The next minute she flew at the\\r\\nprince, seized his hand, and dragged him after her to the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuickâ\\x80\\x94come along!â\\x80\\x9d she cried, breathless with agitation and\\r\\nimpatience. â\\x80\\x9cCome along with me this moment!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut you declared I wasnâ\\x80\\x99tâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t be a simpleton. You behave just as though you werenâ\\x80\\x99t a man at\\r\\nall. Come on! I shall see, now, with my own eyes. I shall see all.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, let me get my hat, at least.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHereâ\\x80\\x99s your miserable hat. He couldnâ\\x80\\x99t even choose a respectable shape\\r\\nfor his hat! Come on! She did that because I took your part and said\\r\\nyou ought to have comeâ\\x80\\x94little vixen!â\\x80\\x94else she would never have sent you\\r\\nthat silly note. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a most improper note, I call it; most improper\\r\\nfor such an intelligent, well-brought-up girl to write. Hâ\\x80\\x99m! I dare say\\r\\nshe was annoyed that you didnâ\\x80\\x99t come; but she ought to have known that\\r\\none canâ\\x80\\x99t write like that to an idiot like you, for youâ\\x80\\x99d be sure to\\r\\ntake it literally.â\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Epanchin was dragging the prince along with\\r\\nher all the time, and never let go of his hand for an instant. â\\x80\\x9cWhat\\r\\nare you listening for?â\\x80\\x9d she added, seeing that she had committed\\r\\nherself a little. â\\x80\\x9cShe wants a clown like youâ\\x80\\x94she hasnâ\\x80\\x99t seen one for\\r\\nsome timeâ\\x80\\x94to play with. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s why she is anxious for you to come to\\r\\nthe house. And right glad I am that sheâ\\x80\\x99ll make a thorough good fool of\\r\\nyou. You deserve it; and she can do itâ\\x80\\x94oh! she can, indeed!â\\x80\\x94as well as\\r\\nmost people.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPART III\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Epanchin family, or at least the more serious members of it, were\\r\\nsometimes grieved because they seemed so unlike the rest of the world.\\r\\nThey were not quite certain, but had at times a strong suspicion that\\r\\nthings did not happen to them as they did to other people. Others led a\\r\\nquiet, uneventful life, while they were subject to continual upheavals.\\r\\nOthers kept on the rails without difficulty; they ran off at the\\r\\nslightest obstacle. Other houses were governed by a timid routine;\\r\\ntheirs was somehow different. Perhaps Lizabetha Prokofievna was alone\\r\\nin making these fretful observations; the girls, though not wanting in\\r\\nintelligence, were still young; the general was intelligent, too, but\\r\\nnarrow, and in any difficulty he was content to say, â\\x80\\x9cHâ\\x80\\x99m!â\\x80\\x9d and leave\\r\\nthe matter to his wife. Consequently, on her fell the responsibility.\\r\\nIt was not that they distinguished themselves as a family by any\\r\\nparticular originality, or that their excursions off the track led to\\r\\nany breach of the proprieties. Oh no.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was nothing premeditated, there was not even any conscious\\r\\npurpose in it all, and yet, in spite of everything, the family,\\r\\nalthough highly respected, was not quite what every highly respected\\r\\nfamily ought to be. For a long time now Lizabetha Prokofievna had had\\r\\nit in her mind that all the trouble was owing to her â\\x80\\x9cunfortunate\\r\\ncharacter,â\\x80\\x9d and this added to her distress. She blamed her own stupid\\r\\nunconventional â\\x80\\x9ceccentricity.â\\x80\\x9d Always restless, always on the go, she\\r\\nconstantly seemed to lose her way, and to get into trouble over the\\r\\nsimplest and more ordinary affairs of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe said at the beginning of our story, that the Epanchins were liked\\r\\nand esteemed by their neighbours. In spite of his humble origin, Ivan\\r\\nFedorovitch himself was received everywhere with respect. He deserved\\r\\nthis, partly on account of his wealth and position, partly because,\\r\\nthough limited, he was really a very good fellow. But a certain\\r\\nlimitation of mind seems to be an indispensable asset, if not to all\\r\\npublic personages, at least to all serious financiers. Added to this,\\r\\nhis manner was modest and unassuming; he knew when to be silent, yet\\r\\nnever allowed himself to be trampled upon. Alsoâ\\x80\\x94and this was more\\r\\nimportant than allâ\\x80\\x94he had the advantage of being under exalted\\r\\npatronage.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to Lizabetha Prokofievna, she, as the reader knows, belonged to an\\r\\naristocratic family. True, Russians think more of influential friends\\r\\nthan of birth, but she had both. She was esteemed and even loved by\\r\\npeople of consequence in society, whose example in receiving her was\\r\\ntherefore followed by others. It seems hardly necessary to remark that\\r\\nher family worries and anxieties had little or no foundation, or that\\r\\nher imagination increased them to an absurd degree; but if you have a\\r\\nwart on your forehead or nose, you imagine that all the world is\\r\\nlooking at it, and that people would make fun of you because of it,\\r\\neven if you had discovered America! Doubtless Lizabetha Prokofievna was\\r\\nconsidered â\\x80\\x9ceccentricâ\\x80\\x9d in society, but she was none the less esteemed:\\r\\nthe pity was that she was ceasing to believe in that esteem. When she\\r\\nthought of her daughters, she said to herself sorrowfully that she was\\r\\na hindrance rather than a help to their future, that her character and\\r\\ntemper were absurd, ridiculous, insupportable. Naturally, she put the\\r\\nblame on her surroundings, and from morning to night was quarrelling\\r\\nwith her husband and children, whom she really loved to the point of\\r\\nself-sacrifice, even, one might say, of passion.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was, above all distressed by the idea that her daughters might grow\\r\\nup â\\x80\\x9ceccentric,â\\x80\\x9d like herself; she believed that no other society girls\\r\\nwere like them. â\\x80\\x9cThey are growing into Nihilists!â\\x80\\x9d she repeated over\\r\\nand over again. For years she had tormented herself with this idea, and\\r\\nwith the question: â\\x80\\x9cWhy donâ\\x80\\x99t they get married?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is to annoy their mother; that is their one aim in life; it can be\\r\\nnothing else. The fact is it is all of a piece with these modern ideas,\\r\\nthat wretched womanâ\\x80\\x99s question! Six months ago Aglaya took a fancy to\\r\\ncut off her magnificent hair. Why, even I, when I was young, had\\r\\nnothing like it! The scissors were in her hand, and I had to go down on\\r\\nmy knees and implore her... She did it, I know, from sheer mischief, to\\r\\nspite her mother, for she is a naughty, capricious girl, a real spoiled\\r\\nchild spiteful and mischievous to a degree! And then Alexandra wanted\\r\\nto shave her head, not from caprice or mischief, but, like a little\\r\\nfool, simply because Aglaya persuaded her she would sleep better\\r\\nwithout her hair, and not suffer from headache! And how many suitors\\r\\nhave they not had during the last five years! Excellent offers, too!\\r\\nWhat more do they want? Why donâ\\x80\\x99t they get married? For no other reason\\r\\nthan to vex their motherâ\\x80\\x94noneâ\\x80\\x94none!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Lizabetha Prokofievna felt somewhat consoled when she could say\\r\\nthat one of her girls, Adelaida, was settled at last. â\\x80\\x9cIt will be one\\r\\noff our hands!â\\x80\\x9d she declared aloud, though in private she expressed\\r\\nherself with greater tenderness. The engagement was both happy and\\r\\nsuitable, and was therefore approved in society. Prince S. was a\\r\\ndistinguished man, he had money, and his future wife was devoted to\\r\\nhim; what more could be desired? Lizabetha Prokofievna had felt less\\r\\nanxious about this daughter, however, although she considered her\\r\\nartistic tastes suspicious. But to make up for them she was, as her\\r\\nmother expressed it, â\\x80\\x9cmerry,â\\x80\\x9d and had plenty of â\\x80\\x9ccommon-sense.â\\x80\\x9d It was\\r\\nAglayaâ\\x80\\x99s future which disturbed her most. With regard to her eldest\\r\\ndaughter, Alexandra, the mother never quite knew whether there was\\r\\ncause for anxiety or not. Sometimes she felt as if there was nothing to\\r\\nbe expected from her. She was twenty-five now, and must be fated to be\\r\\nan old maid, and â\\x80\\x9cwith such beauty, too!â\\x80\\x9d The mother spent whole nights\\r\\nin weeping and lamenting, while all the time the cause of her grief\\r\\nslumbered peacefully. â\\x80\\x9cWhat is the matter with her? Is she a Nihilist,\\r\\nor simply a fool?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Lizabetha Prokofievna knew perfectly well how unnecessary was the\\r\\nlast question. She set a high value on Alexandra Ivanovnaâ\\x80\\x99s judgment,\\r\\nand often consulted her in difficulties; but that she was a â\\x80\\x98wet henâ\\x80\\x99\\r\\nshe never for a moment doubted. â\\x80\\x9cShe is so calm; nothing rouses\\r\\nherâ\\x80\\x94though wet hens are not always calm! Oh! I canâ\\x80\\x99t understand it!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nHer eldest daughter inspired Lizabetha with a kind of puzzled\\r\\ncompassion. She did not feel this in Aglayaâ\\x80\\x99s case, though the latter\\r\\nwas her idol. It may be said that these outbursts and epithets, such as\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwet henâ\\x80\\x9d (in which the maternal solicitude usually showed itself),\\r\\nonly made Alexandra laugh. Sometimes the most trivial thing annoyed\\r\\nMrs. Epanchin, and drove her into a frenzy. For instance, Alexandra\\r\\nIvanovna liked to sleep late, and was always dreaming, though her\\r\\ndreams had the peculiarity of being as innocent and naive as those of a\\r\\nchild of seven; and the very innocence of her dreams annoyed her\\r\\nmother. Once she dreamt of nine hens, and this was the cause of quite a\\r\\nserious quarrelâ\\x80\\x94no one knew why. Another time she hadâ\\x80\\x94it was most\\r\\nunusualâ\\x80\\x94a dream with a spark of originality in it. She dreamt of a monk\\r\\nin a dark room, into which she was too frightened to go. Adelaida and\\r\\nAglaya rushed off with shrieks of laughter to relate this to their\\r\\nmother, but she was quite angry, and said her daughters were all fools.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHâ\\x80\\x99m! she is as stupid as a fool! A veritable â\\x80\\x98wet henâ\\x80\\x99! Nothing\\r\\nexcites her; and yet she is not happy; some days it makes one miserable\\r\\nonly to look at her! Why is she unhappy, I wonder?â\\x80\\x9d At times Lizabetha\\r\\nProkofievna put this question to her husband, and as usual she spoke in\\r\\nthe threatening tone of one who demands an immediate answer. Ivan\\r\\nFedorovitch would frown, shrug his shoulders, and at last give his\\r\\nopinion: â\\x80\\x9cShe needs a husband!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGod forbid that he should share your ideas, Ivan Fedorovitch!â\\x80\\x9d his\\r\\nwife flashed back. â\\x80\\x9cOr that he should be as gross and churlish as you!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general promptly made his escape, and Lizabetha Prokofievna after a\\r\\nwhile grew calm again. That evening, of course, she would be unusually\\r\\nattentive, gentle, and respectful to her â\\x80\\x9cgross and churlishâ\\x80\\x9d husband,\\r\\nher â\\x80\\x9cdear, kind Ivan Fedorovitch,â\\x80\\x9d for she had never left off loving\\r\\nhim. She was even still â\\x80\\x9cin loveâ\\x80\\x9d with him. He knew it well, and for\\r\\nhis part held her in the greatest esteem.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the motherâ\\x80\\x99s great and continual anxiety was Aglaya. â\\x80\\x9cShe is\\r\\nexactly like meâ\\x80\\x94my image in everything,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Epanchin to herself.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA tyrant! A real little demon! A Nihilist! Eccentric, senseless and\\r\\nmischievous! Good Lord, how unhappy she will be!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as we said before, the fact of Adelaidaâ\\x80\\x99s approaching marriage was\\r\\nbalm to the mother. For a whole month she forgot her fears and worries.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdelaidaâ\\x80\\x99s fate was settled; and with her name that of Aglayaâ\\x80\\x99s was\\r\\nlinked, in society gossip. People whispered that Aglaya, too, was â\\x80\\x9cas\\r\\ngood as engaged;â\\x80\\x9d and Aglaya always looked so sweet and behaved so well\\r\\n(during this period), that the motherâ\\x80\\x99s heart was full of joy. Of\\r\\ncourse, Evgenie Pavlovitch must be thoroughly studied first, before the\\r\\nfinal step should be taken; but, really, how lovely dear Aglaya had\\r\\nbecomeâ\\x80\\x94she actually grew more beautiful every day! And thenâ\\x80\\x94Yes, and\\r\\nthenâ\\x80\\x94this abominable prince showed his face again, and everything went\\r\\ntopsy-turvy at once, and everyone seemed as mad as March hares.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat had really happened?\\r\\n\\r\\nIf it had been any other family than the Epanchinsâ\\x80\\x99, nothing particular\\r\\nwould have happened. But, thanks to Mrs. Epanchinâ\\x80\\x99s invariable\\r\\nfussiness and anxiety, there could not be the slightest hitch in the\\r\\nsimplest matters of everyday life, but she immediately foresaw the most\\r\\ndreadful and alarming consequences, and suffered accordingly.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat then must have been her condition, when, among all the imaginary\\r\\nanxieties and calamities which so constantly beset her, she now saw\\r\\nlooming ahead a serious cause for annoyanceâ\\x80\\x94something really likely to\\r\\narouse doubts and suspicions!\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow dared they, how _dared_ they write that hateful anonymous letter\\r\\ninforming me that Aglaya is in communication with Nastasia Philipovna?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nshe thought, as she dragged the prince along towards her own house, and\\r\\nagain when she sat him down at the round table where the family was\\r\\nalready assembled. â\\x80\\x9cHow dared they so much as _think_ of such a thing?\\r\\nI should _die_ with shame if I thought there was a particle of truth in\\r\\nit, or if I were to show the letter to Aglaya herself! Who dares play\\r\\nthese jokes upon _us_, the Epanchins? _Why_ didnâ\\x80\\x99t we go to the Yelagin\\r\\ninstead of coming down here? I _told_ you we had better go to the\\r\\nYelagin this summer, Ivan Fedorovitch. Itâ\\x80\\x99s all your fault. I dare say\\r\\nit was that Varia who sent the letter. Itâ\\x80\\x99s all Ivan Fedorovitch.\\r\\n_That_ woman is doing it all for him, I know she is, to show she can\\r\\nmake a fool of him now just as she did when he used to give her pearls.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut after all is said, we are mixed up in it. Your daughters are mixed\\r\\nup in it, Ivan Fedorovitch; young ladies in society, young ladies at an\\r\\nage to be married; they were present, they heard everything there was\\r\\nto hear. They were mixed up with that other scene, too, with those\\r\\ndreadful youths. You must be pleased to remember they heard it all. I\\r\\ncannot forgive that wretched prince. I never shall forgive him! And\\r\\nwhy, if you please, has Aglaya had an attack of nerves for these last\\r\\nthree days? Why has she all but quarrelled with her sisters, even with\\r\\nAlexandraâ\\x80\\x94whom she respects so much that she always kisses her hands as\\r\\nthough she were her mother? What are all these riddles of hers that we\\r\\nhave to guess? What has Gavrila Ardalionovitch to do with it? Why did\\r\\nshe take upon herself to champion him this morning, and burst into\\r\\ntears over it? Why is there an allusion to that cursed â\\x80\\x98poor knightâ\\x80\\x99 in\\r\\nthe anonymous letter? And why did I rush off to him just now like a\\r\\nlunatic, and drag him back here? I do believe Iâ\\x80\\x99ve gone mad at last.\\r\\nWhat on earth have I done now? To talk to a young man about my\\r\\ndaughterâ\\x80\\x99s secretsâ\\x80\\x94and secrets having to do with himself, too! Thank\\r\\ngoodness, heâ\\x80\\x99s an idiot, and a friend of the house! Surely Aglaya\\r\\nhasnâ\\x80\\x99t fallen in love with such a gaby! What an idea! Pfu! we ought all\\r\\nto be put under glass casesâ\\x80\\x94myself first of allâ\\x80\\x94and be shown off as\\r\\ncuriosities, at ten copecks a peep!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI shall never forgive you for all this, Ivan Fedorovitchâ\\x80\\x94never! Look\\r\\nat her now. Why doesnâ\\x80\\x99t she make fun of him? She said she would, and\\r\\nshe doesnâ\\x80\\x99t. Look there! She stares at him with all her eyes, and\\r\\ndoesnâ\\x80\\x99t move; and yet she told him not to come. He looks pale enough;\\r\\nand that abominable chatterbox, Evgenie Pavlovitch, monopolizes the\\r\\nwhole of the conversation. Nobody else can get a word in. I could soon\\r\\nfind out all about everything if I could only change the subject.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince certainly was very pale. He sat at the table and seemed to\\r\\nbe feeling, by turns, sensations of alarm and rapture.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, how frightened he was of looking to one sideâ\\x80\\x94one particular\\r\\ncornerâ\\x80\\x94whence he knew very well that a pair of dark eyes were watching\\r\\nhim intently, and how happy he was to think that he was once more among\\r\\nthem, and occasionally hearing that well-known voice, although she had\\r\\nwritten and forbidden him to come again!\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat on earth will she say to me, I wonder?â\\x80\\x9d he thought to himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had not said a word yet; he sat silent and listened to Evgenie\\r\\nPavlovitchâ\\x80\\x99s eloquence. The latter had never appeared so happy and\\r\\nexcited as on this evening. The prince listened to him, but for a long\\r\\ntime did not take in a word he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nExcepting Ivan Fedorovitch, who had not as yet returned from town, the\\r\\nwhole family was present. Prince S. was there; and they all intended to\\r\\ngo out to hear the band very soon.\\r\\n\\r\\nColia arrived presently and joined the circle. â\\x80\\x9cSo he is received as\\r\\nusual, after all,â\\x80\\x9d thought the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Epanchinsâ\\x80\\x99 country-house was a charming building, built after the\\r\\nmodel of a Swiss chalet, and covered with creepers. It was surrounded\\r\\non all sides by a flower garden, and the family sat, as a rule, on the\\r\\nopen verandah as at the princeâ\\x80\\x99s house.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe subject under discussion did not appear to be very popular with the\\r\\nassembly, and some would have been delighted to change it; but Evgenie\\r\\nwould not stop holding forth, and the princeâ\\x80\\x99s arrival seemed to spur\\r\\nhim on to still further oratorical efforts.\\r\\n\\r\\nLizabetha Prokofievna frowned, but had not as yet grasped the subject,\\r\\nwhich seemed to have arisen out of a heated argument. Aglaya sat apart,\\r\\nalmost in the corner, listening in stubborn silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExcuse me,â\\x80\\x9d continued Evgenie Pavlovitch hotly, â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t say a word\\r\\nagainst liberalism. Liberalism is not a sin, it is a necessary part of\\r\\na great whole, which whole would collapse and fall to pieces without\\r\\nit. Liberalism has just as much right to exist as has the most moral\\r\\nconservatism; but I am attacking _Russian_ liberalism; and I attack it\\r\\nfor the simple reason that a Russian liberal is not a Russian liberal,\\r\\nhe is a non-Russian liberal. Show me a real Russian liberal, and Iâ\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\nkiss him before you all, with pleasure.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf he cared to kiss you, that is,â\\x80\\x9d said Alexandra, whose cheeks were\\r\\nred with irritation and excitement.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLook at that, now,â\\x80\\x9d thought the mother to herself, â\\x80\\x9cshe does nothing\\r\\nbut sleep and eat for a year at a time, and then suddenly flies out in\\r\\nthe most incomprehensible way!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince observed that Alexandra appeared to be angry with Evgenie,\\r\\nbecause he spoke on a serious subject in a frivolous manner, pretending\\r\\nto be in earnest, but with an under-current of irony.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was saying just now, before you came in, prince, that there has been\\r\\nnothing national up to now, about our liberalism, and nothing the\\r\\nliberals do, or have done, is in the least degree national. They are\\r\\ndrawn from two classes only, the old landowning class, and clerical\\r\\nfamiliesâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow, nothing that they have done is Russian?â\\x80\\x9d asked Prince S.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt may be Russian, but it is not national. Our liberals are not\\r\\nRussian, nor are our conservatives, and you may be sure that the nation\\r\\ndoes not recognize anything that has been done by the landed gentry, or\\r\\nby the seminarists, or what is to be done either.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome, thatâ\\x80\\x99s good! How can you maintain such a paradox? If you are\\r\\nserious, that is. I cannot allow such a statement about the landed\\r\\nproprietors to pass unchallenged. Why, you are a landed proprietor\\r\\nyourself!â\\x80\\x9d cried Prince S. hotly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI suppose youâ\\x80\\x99ll say there is nothing national about our literature\\r\\neither?â\\x80\\x9d said Alexandra.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, I am not a great authority on literary questions, but I\\r\\ncertainly do hold that Russian literature is not Russian, except\\r\\nperhaps Lomonosoff, Pouschkin and Gogol.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn the first place, that is a considerable admission, and in the\\r\\nsecond place, one of the above was a peasant, and the other two were\\r\\nboth landed proprietors!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuite so, but donâ\\x80\\x99t be in such a hurry! For since it has been the part\\r\\nof these three men, and only these three, to say something absolutely\\r\\ntheir own, not borrowed, so by this very fact these three men become\\r\\nreally national. If any Russian shall have done or said anything really\\r\\nand absolutely original, he is to be called national from that moment,\\r\\nthough he may not be able to talk the Russian language; still he is a\\r\\nnational Russian. I consider that an axiom. But we were not speaking of\\r\\nliterature; we began by discussing the socialists. Very well then, I\\r\\ninsist that there does not exist one single Russian socialist. There\\r\\ndoes not, and there has never existed such a one, because all\\r\\nsocialists are derived from the two classesâ\\x80\\x94the landed proprietors, and\\r\\nthe seminarists. All our eminent socialists are merely old liberals of\\r\\nthe class of landed proprietors, men who were liberals in the days of\\r\\nserfdom. Why do you laugh? Give me their books, give me their studies,\\r\\ntheir memoirs, and though I am not a literary critic, yet I will prove\\r\\nas clear as day that every chapter and every word of their writings has\\r\\nbeen the work of a former landed proprietor of the old school. Youâ\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\nfind that all their raptures, all their generous transports are\\r\\nproprietary, all their woes and their tears, proprietary; all\\r\\nproprietary or seminarist! You are laughing again, and you, prince, are\\r\\nsmiling too. Donâ\\x80\\x99t you agree with me?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was true enough that everybody was laughing, the prince among them.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI cannot tell you on the instant whether I agree with you or not,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nsaid the latter, suddenly stopping his laughter, and starting like a\\r\\nschoolboy caught at mischief. â\\x80\\x9cBut, I assure you, I am listening to you\\r\\nwith extreme gratification.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo saying, he almost panted with agitation, and a cold sweat stood upon\\r\\nhis forehead. These were his first words since he had entered the\\r\\nhouse; he tried to lift his eyes, and look around, but dared not;\\r\\nEvgenie Pavlovitch noticed his confusion, and smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll just tell you one fact, ladies and gentlemen,â\\x80\\x9d continued the\\r\\nlatter, with apparent seriousness and even exaltation of manner, but\\r\\nwith a suggestion of â\\x80\\x9cchaffâ\\x80\\x9d behind every word, as though he were\\r\\nlaughing in his sleeve at his own nonsenseâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9ca fact, the discovery of\\r\\nwhich, I believe, I may claim to have made by myself alone. At all\\r\\nevents, no other has ever said or written a word about it; and in this\\r\\nfact is expressed the whole essence of Russian liberalism of the sort\\r\\nwhich I am now considering.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn the first place, what is liberalism, speaking generally, but an\\r\\nattack (whether mistaken or reasonable, is quite another question) upon\\r\\nthe existing order of things? Is this so? Yes. Very well. Then my\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98factâ\\x80\\x99 consists in this, that _Russian_ liberalism is not an attack\\r\\nupon the existing order of things, but an attack upon the very essence\\r\\nof things themselvesâ\\x80\\x94indeed, on the things themselves; not an attack on\\r\\nthe Russian order of things, but on Russia itself. My Russian liberal\\r\\ngoes so far as to reject Russia; that is, he hates and strikes his own\\r\\nmother. Every misfortune and mishap of the mother-country fills him\\r\\nwith mirth, and even with ecstasy. He hates the national customs,\\r\\nRussian history, and everything. If he has a justification, it is that\\r\\nhe does not know what he is doing, and believes that his hatred of\\r\\nRussia is the grandest and most profitable kind of liberalism. (You\\r\\nwill often find a liberal who is applauded and esteemed by his fellows,\\r\\nbut who is in reality the dreariest, blindest, dullest of\\r\\nconservatives, and is not aware of the fact.) This hatred for Russia\\r\\nhas been mistaken by some of our â\\x80\\x98Russian liberalsâ\\x80\\x99 for sincere love of\\r\\ntheir country, and they boast that they see better than their\\r\\nneighbours what real love of oneâ\\x80\\x99s country should consist in. But of\\r\\nlate they have grown, more candid and are ashamed of the expression\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98love of country,â\\x80\\x99 and have annihilated the very spirit of the words as\\r\\nsomething injurious and petty and undignified. This is the truth, and I\\r\\nhold by it; but at the same time it is a phenomenon which has not been\\r\\nrepeated at any other time or place; and therefore, though I hold to it\\r\\nas a fact, yet I recognize that it is an accidental phenomenon, and may\\r\\nlikely enough pass away. There can be no such thing anywhere else as a\\r\\nliberal who really hates his country; and how is this fact to be\\r\\nexplained among _us?_ By my original statement that a Russian liberal\\r\\nis _not_ a _Russian_ liberalâ\\x80\\x94thatâ\\x80\\x99s the only explanation that I can\\r\\nsee.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI take all that you have said as a joke,â\\x80\\x9d said Prince S. seriously.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have not seen all kinds of liberals, and cannot, therefore, set\\r\\nmyself up as a judge,â\\x80\\x9d said Alexandra, â\\x80\\x9cbut I have heard all you have\\r\\nsaid with indignation. You have taken some accidental case and twisted\\r\\nit into a universal law, which is unjust.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAccidental case!â\\x80\\x9d said Evgenie Pavlovitch. â\\x80\\x9cDo you consider it an\\r\\naccidental case, prince?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI must also admit,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, â\\x80\\x9cthat I have not seen much, or\\r\\nbeen very far into the question; but I cannot help thinking that you\\r\\nare more or less right, and that Russian liberalismâ\\x80\\x94that phase of it\\r\\nwhich you are considering, at leastâ\\x80\\x94really is sometimes inclined to\\r\\nhate Russia itself, and not only its existing order of things in\\r\\ngeneral. Of course this is only _partially_ the truth; you cannot lay\\r\\ndown the law for all...â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince blushed and broke off, without finishing what he meant to\\r\\nsay.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of his shyness and agitation, he could not help being greatly\\r\\ninterested in the conversation. A special characteristic of his was the\\r\\nnaive candour with which he always listened to arguments which\\r\\ninterested him, and with which he answered any questions put to him on\\r\\nthe subject at issue. In the very expression of his face this naivete\\r\\nwas unmistakably evident, this disbelief in the insincerity of others,\\r\\nand unsuspecting disregard of irony or humour in their words.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut though Evgenie Pavlovitch had put his questions to the prince with\\r\\nno other purpose but to enjoy the joke of his simple-minded\\r\\nseriousness, yet now, at his answer, he was surprised into some\\r\\nseriousness himself, and looked gravely at Muishkin as though he had\\r\\nnot expected that sort of answer at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, how strange!â\\x80\\x9d he ejaculated. â\\x80\\x9cYou didnâ\\x80\\x99t answer me seriously,\\r\\nsurely, did you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDid not you ask me the question seriouslyâ\\x80\\x9d inquired the prince, in\\r\\namazement.\\r\\n\\r\\nEverybody laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, trust _him_ for that!â\\x80\\x9d said Adelaida. â\\x80\\x9cEvgenie Pavlovitch turns\\r\\neverything and everybody he can lay hold of to ridicule. You should\\r\\nhear the things he says sometimes, apparently in perfect seriousness.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn my opinion the conversation has been a painful one throughout, and\\r\\nwe ought never to have begun it,â\\x80\\x9d said Alexandra. â\\x80\\x9cWe were all going\\r\\nfor a walkâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome along then,â\\x80\\x9d said Evgenie; â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s a glorious evening. But, to\\r\\nprove that this time I was speaking absolutely seriously, and\\r\\nespecially to prove this to the prince (for you, prince, have\\r\\ninterested me exceedingly, and I swear to you that I am not quite such\\r\\nan ass as I like to appear sometimes, although I am rather an ass, I\\r\\nadmit), andâ\\x80\\x94well, ladies and gentlemen, will you allow me to put just\\r\\none more question to the prince, out of pure curiosity? It shall be the\\r\\nlast. This question came into my mind a couple of hours since (you see,\\r\\nprince, I do think seriously at times), and I made my own decision upon\\r\\nit; now I wish to hear what the prince will say to it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe have just used the expression â\\x80\\x98accidental case.â\\x80\\x99 This is a\\r\\nsignificant phrase; we often hear it. Well, not long since everyone was\\r\\ntalking and reading about that terrible murder of six people on the\\r\\npart of aâ\\x80\\x94young fellow, and of the extraordinary speech of the counsel\\r\\nfor the defence, who observed that in the poverty-stricken condition of\\r\\nthe criminal it must have come _naturally_ into his head to kill these\\r\\nsix people. I do not quote his words, but that is the sense of them, or\\r\\nsomething very like it. Now, in my opinion, the barrister who put\\r\\nforward this extraordinary plea was probably absolutely convinced that\\r\\nhe was stating the most liberal, the most humane, the most enlightened\\r\\nview of the case that could possibly be brought forward in these days.\\r\\nNow, was this distortion, this capacity for a perverted way of viewing\\r\\nthings, a special or accidental case, or is such a general rule?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEveryone laughed at this.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA special caseâ\\x80\\x94accidental, of course!â\\x80\\x9d cried Alexandra and Adelaida.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLet me remind you once more, Evgenie,â\\x80\\x9d said Prince S., â\\x80\\x9cthat your joke\\r\\nis getting a little threadbare.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat do you think about it, prince?â\\x80\\x9d asked Evgenie, taking no notice\\r\\nof the last remark, and observing Muishkinâ\\x80\\x99s serious eyes fixed upon\\r\\nhis face. â\\x80\\x9cWhat do you thinkâ\\x80\\x94was it a special or a usual caseâ\\x80\\x94the rule,\\r\\nor an exception? I confess I put the question especially for you.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I donâ\\x80\\x99t think it was a special case,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, quietly,\\r\\nbut firmly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear fellow!â\\x80\\x9d cried Prince S., with some annoyance, â\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t you see\\r\\nthat he is chaffing you? He is simply laughing at you, and wants to\\r\\nmake game of you.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI thought Evgenie Pavlovitch was talking seriously,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince,\\r\\nblushing and dropping his eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear prince,â\\x80\\x9d continued Prince S. â\\x80\\x9cremember what you and I were\\r\\nsaying two or three months ago. We spoke of the fact that in our newly\\r\\nopened Law Courts one could already lay oneâ\\x80\\x99s finger upon so many\\r\\ntalented and remarkable young barristers. How pleased you were with the\\r\\nstate of things as we found it, and how glad I was to observe your\\r\\ndelight! We both said it was a matter to be proud of; but this clumsy\\r\\ndefence that Evgenie mentions, this strange argument _can_, of course,\\r\\nonly be an accidental caseâ\\x80\\x94one in a thousand!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince reflected a little, but very soon he replied, with absolute\\r\\nconviction in his tone, though he still spoke somewhat shyly and\\r\\ntimidly:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI only wished to say that this â\\x80\\x98distortion,â\\x80\\x99 as Evgenie Pavlovitch\\r\\nexpressed it, is met with very often, and is far more the general rule\\r\\nthan the exception, unfortunately for Russia. So much so, that if this\\r\\ndistortion were not the general rule, perhaps these dreadful crimes\\r\\nwould be less frequent.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDreadful crimes? But I can assure you that crimes just as dreadful,\\r\\nand probably more horrible, have occurred before our times, and at all\\r\\ntimes, and not only here in Russia, but everywhere else as well. And in\\r\\nmy opinion it is not at all likely that such murders will cease to\\r\\noccur for a very long time to come. The only difference is that in\\r\\nformer times there was less publicity, while now everyone talks and\\r\\nwrites freely about such thingsâ\\x80\\x94which fact gives the impression that\\r\\nsuch crimes have only now sprung into existence. That is where your\\r\\nmistake liesâ\\x80\\x94an extremely natural mistake, I assure you, my dear\\r\\nfellow!â\\x80\\x9d said Prince S.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know that there were just as many, and just as terrible, crimes\\r\\nbefore our times. Not long since I visited a convict prison and made\\r\\nacquaintance with some of the criminals. There were some even more\\r\\ndreadful criminals than this one we have been speaking ofâ\\x80\\x94men who have\\r\\nmurdered a dozen of their fellow-creatures, and feel no remorse\\r\\nwhatever. But what I especially noticed was this, that the very most\\r\\nhopeless and remorseless murdererâ\\x80\\x94however hardened a criminal he may\\r\\nbeâ\\x80\\x94still _knows that he is a criminal_; that is, he is conscious that\\r\\nhe has acted wickedly, though he may feel no remorse whatever. And they\\r\\nwere all like this. Those of whom Evgenie Pavlovitch has spoken, do not\\r\\nadmit that they are criminals at all; they think they had a right to do\\r\\nwhat they did, and that they were even doing a good deed, perhaps. I\\r\\nconsider there is the greatest difference between the two cases. And\\r\\nrecollectâ\\x80\\x94it was a _youth_, at the particular age which is most\\r\\nhelplessly susceptible to the distortion of ideas!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPrince S. was now no longer smiling; he gazed at the prince in\\r\\nbewilderment.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlexandra, who had seemed to wish to put in her word when the prince\\r\\nbegan, now sat silent, as though some sudden thought had caused her to\\r\\nchange her mind about speaking.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvgenie Pavlovitch gazed at him in real surprise, and this time his\\r\\nexpression of face had no mockery in it whatever.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat are you looking so surprised about, my friend?â\\x80\\x9d asked Mrs.\\r\\nEpanchin, suddenly. â\\x80\\x9cDid you suppose he was stupider than yourself, and\\r\\nwas incapable of forming his own opinions, or what?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo! Oh no! Not at all!â\\x80\\x9d said Evgenie. â\\x80\\x9cButâ\\x80\\x94how is it, prince, that\\r\\nyouâ\\x80\\x94(excuse the question, will you?)â\\x80\\x94if you are capable of observing\\r\\nand seeing things as you evidently do, how is it that you saw nothing\\r\\ndistorted or perverted in that claim upon your property, which you\\r\\nacknowledged a day or two since; and which was full of arguments\\r\\nfounded upon the most distorted views of right and wrong?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you what, my friend,â\\x80\\x9d cried Mrs. Epanchin, of a sudden,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9chere are we all sitting here and imagining we are very clever, and\\r\\nperhaps laughing at the prince, some of us, and meanwhile he has\\r\\nreceived a letter this very day in which that same claimant renounces\\r\\nhis claim, and begs the princeâ\\x80\\x99s pardon. There! _we_ donâ\\x80\\x99t often get\\r\\nthat sort of letter; and yet we are not ashamed to walk with our noses\\r\\nin the air before him.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd Hippolyte has come down here to stay,â\\x80\\x9d said Colia, suddenly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat! has he arrived?â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, starting up.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I brought him down from town just after you had left the house.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere now! Itâ\\x80\\x99s just like him,â\\x80\\x9d cried Lizabetha Prokofievna, boiling\\r\\nover once more, and entirely oblivious of the fact that she had just\\r\\ntaken the princeâ\\x80\\x99s part. â\\x80\\x9cI dare swear that you went up to town\\r\\nyesterday on purpose to get the little wretch to do you the great\\r\\nhonour of coming to stay at your house. You did go up to town, you know\\r\\nyou didâ\\x80\\x94you said so yourself! Now then, did you, or did you not, go\\r\\ndown on your knees and beg him to come, confess!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, he didnâ\\x80\\x99t, for I saw it all myself,â\\x80\\x9d said Colia. â\\x80\\x9cOn the contrary,\\r\\nHippolyte kissed his hand twice and thanked him; and all the prince\\r\\nsaid was that he thought Hippolyte might feel better here in the\\r\\ncountry!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t, Colia,â\\x80\\x94what is the use of saying all that?â\\x80\\x9d cried the prince,\\r\\nrising and taking his hat.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhere are you going to now?â\\x80\\x9d cried Mrs. Epanchin.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNever mind about him now, prince,â\\x80\\x9d said Colia. â\\x80\\x9cHe is all right and\\r\\ntaking a nap after the journey. He is very happy to be here; but I\\r\\nthink perhaps it would be better if you let him alone for today,â\\x80\\x94he is\\r\\nvery sensitive now that he is so illâ\\x80\\x94and he might be embarrassed if you\\r\\nshow him too much attention at first. He is decidedly better today, and\\r\\nsays he has not felt so well for the last six months, and has coughed\\r\\nmuch less, too.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince observed that Aglaya came out of her corner and approached\\r\\nthe table at this point.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did not dare look at her, but he was conscious, to the very tips of\\r\\nhis fingers, that she was gazing at him, perhaps angrily; and that she\\r\\nhad probably flushed up with a look of fiery indignation in her black\\r\\neyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt seems to me, Mr. Colia, that you were very foolish to bring your\\r\\nyoung friend downâ\\x80\\x94if he is the same consumptive boy who wept so\\r\\nprofusely, and invited us all to his own funeral,â\\x80\\x9d remarked Evgenie\\r\\nPavlovitch. â\\x80\\x9cHe talked so eloquently about the blank wall outside his\\r\\nbedroom window, that Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure he will never support life here without\\r\\nit.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think so too,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Epanchin; â\\x80\\x9che will quarrel with you, and be\\r\\noff,â\\x80\\x9d and she drew her workbox towards her with an air of dignity,\\r\\nquite oblivious of the fact that the family was about to start for a\\r\\nwalk in the park.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I remember he boasted about the blank wall in an extraordinary\\r\\nway,â\\x80\\x9d continued Evgenie, â\\x80\\x9cand I feel that without that blank wall he\\r\\nwill never be able to die eloquently; and he does so long to die\\r\\neloquently!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, you must forgive him the blank wall,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, quietly.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe has come down to see a few trees now, poor fellow.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, I forgive him with all my heart; you may tell him so if you like,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nlaughed Evgenie.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t think you should take it quite like that,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince,\\r\\nquietly, and without removing his eyes from the carpet. â\\x80\\x9cI think it is\\r\\nmore a case of his forgiving you.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cForgiving me! why so? What have I done to need his forgiveness?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf you donâ\\x80\\x99t understand, thenâ\\x80\\x94but of course, you do understand. He\\r\\nwishedâ\\x80\\x94he wished to bless you all round and to have your\\r\\nblessingâ\\x80\\x94before he diedâ\\x80\\x94thatâ\\x80\\x99s all.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear prince,â\\x80\\x9d began Prince S., hurriedly, exchanging glances with\\r\\nsome of those present, â\\x80\\x9cyou will not easily find heaven on earth, and\\r\\nyet you seem to expect to. Heaven is a difficult thing to find\\r\\nanywhere, prince; far more difficult than appears to that good heart of\\r\\nyours. Better stop this conversation, or we shall all be growing quite\\r\\ndisturbed in our minds, andâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLetâ\\x80\\x99s go and hear the band, then,â\\x80\\x9d said Lizabetha Prokofievna, angrily\\r\\nrising from her place.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest of the company followed her example.\\r\\n\\r\\nII.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince suddenly approached Evgenie Pavlovitch.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEvgenie Pavlovitch,â\\x80\\x9d he said, with strange excitement and seizing the\\r\\nlatterâ\\x80\\x99s hand in his own, â\\x80\\x9cbe assured that I esteem you as a generous\\r\\nand honourable man, in spite of everything. Be assured of that.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEvgenie Pavlovitch fell back a step in astonishment. For one moment it\\r\\nwas all he could do to restrain himself from bursting out laughing;\\r\\nbut, looking closer, he observed that the prince did not seem to be\\r\\nquite himself; at all events, he was in a very curious state.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t mind betting, prince,â\\x80\\x9d he cried, â\\x80\\x9cthat you did not in the\\r\\nleast mean to say that, and very likely you meant to address someone\\r\\nelse altogether. What is it? Are you feeling unwell or anything?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery likely, extremely likely, and you must be a very close observer\\r\\nto detect the fact that perhaps I did not intend to come up to _you_ at\\r\\nall.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo saying he smiled strangely; but suddenly and excitedly he began\\r\\nagain:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t remind me of what I have done or said. Donâ\\x80\\x99t! I am very much\\r\\nashamed of myself, Iâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, what have you done? I donâ\\x80\\x99t understand you.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI see you are ashamed of me, Evgenie Pavlovitch; you are blushing for\\r\\nme; thatâ\\x80\\x99s a sign of a good heart. Donâ\\x80\\x99t be afraid; I shall go away\\r\\ndirectly.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s the matter with him? Do his fits begin like that?â\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nLizabetha Prokofievna, in a high state of alarm, addressing Colia.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, no, Lizabetha Prokofievna, take no notice of me. I am not going to\\r\\nhave a fit. I will go away directly; but I know I am afflicted. I was\\r\\ntwenty-four years an invalid, you seeâ\\x80\\x94the first twenty-four years of my\\r\\nlifeâ\\x80\\x94so take all I do and say as the sayings and actions of an invalid.\\r\\nIâ\\x80\\x99m going away directly, I really amâ\\x80\\x94donâ\\x80\\x99t be afraid. I am not\\r\\nblushing, for I donâ\\x80\\x99t think I need blush about it, need I? But I see\\r\\nthat I am out of place in societyâ\\x80\\x94society is better without me. Itâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nnot vanity, I assure you. I have thought over it all these last three\\r\\ndays, and I have made up my mind that I ought to unbosom myself\\r\\ncandidly before you at the first opportunity. There are certain things,\\r\\ncertain great ideas, which I must not so much as approach, as Prince S.\\r\\nhas just reminded me, or I shall make you all laugh. I have no sense of\\r\\nproportion, I know; my words and gestures do not express my ideasâ\\x80\\x94they\\r\\nare a humiliation and abasement of the ideas, and therefore, I have no\\r\\nrightâ\\x80\\x94and I am too sensitive. Still, I believe I am beloved in this\\r\\nhousehold, and esteemed far more than I deserve. But I canâ\\x80\\x99t help\\r\\nknowing that after twenty-four years of illness there must be some\\r\\ntrace left, so that it is impossible for people to refrain from\\r\\nlaughing at me sometimes; donâ\\x80\\x99t you think so?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe seemed to pause for a reply, for some verdict, as it were, and\\r\\nlooked humbly around him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll present stood rooted to the earth with amazement at this unexpected\\r\\nand apparently uncalled-for outbreak; but the poor princeâ\\x80\\x99s painful and\\r\\nrambling speech gave rise to a strange episode.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy do you say all this here?â\\x80\\x9d cried Aglaya, suddenly. â\\x80\\x9cWhy do you\\r\\ntalk like this to _them?_â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe appeared to be in the last stages of wrath and irritation; her eyes\\r\\nflashed. The prince stood dumbly and blindly before her, and suddenly\\r\\ngrew pale.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere is not one of them all who is worthy of these words of yours,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\ncontinued Aglaya. â\\x80\\x9cNot one of them is worth your little finger, not one\\r\\nof them has heart or head to compare with yours! You are more honest\\r\\nthan all, and better, nobler, kinder, wiser than all. There are some\\r\\nhere who are unworthy to bend and pick up the handkerchief you have\\r\\njust dropped. Why do you humiliate yourself like this, and place\\r\\nyourself lower than these people? Why do you debase yourself before\\r\\nthem? Why have you no pride?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy God! Who would ever have believed this?â\\x80\\x9d cried Mrs. Epanchin,\\r\\nwringing her hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHurrah for the â\\x80\\x98poor knightâ\\x80\\x99!â\\x80\\x9d cried Colia.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBe quiet! How dare they laugh at me in your house?â\\x80\\x9d said Aglaya,\\r\\nturning sharply on her mother in that hysterical frame of mind that\\r\\nrides recklessly over every obstacle and plunges blindly through\\r\\nproprieties. â\\x80\\x9cWhy does everyone, everyone worry and torment me? Why\\r\\nhave they all been bullying me these three days about you, prince? I\\r\\nwill not marry youâ\\x80\\x94never, and under no circumstances! Know that once\\r\\nand for all; as if anyone could marry an absurd creature like you! Just\\r\\nlook in the glass and see what you look like, this very moment! Why,\\r\\n_why_ do they torment me and say I am going to marry you? You must know\\r\\nit; you are in the plot with them!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo one ever tormented you on the subject,â\\x80\\x9d murmured Adelaida, aghast.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo one ever thought of such a thing! There has never been a word said\\r\\nabout it!â\\x80\\x9d cried Alexandra.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWho has been annoying her? Who has been tormenting the child? Who\\r\\ncould have said such a thing to her? Is she raving?â\\x80\\x9d cried Lizabetha\\r\\nProkofievna, trembling with rage, to the company in general.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEvery one of them has been saying itâ\\x80\\x94every one of themâ\\x80\\x94all these three\\r\\ndays! And I will never, never marry him!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo saying, Aglaya burst into bitter tears, and, hiding her face in her\\r\\nhandkerchief, sank back into a chair.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut he has never evenâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have never asked you to marry me, Aglaya Ivanovna!â\\x80\\x9d said the prince,\\r\\nof a sudden.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_What?_â\\x80\\x9d cried Mrs. Epanchin, raising her hands in horror. â\\x80\\x9c_Whatâ\\x80\\x99s_\\r\\nthat?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could not believe her ears.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI meant to sayâ\\x80\\x94I only meant to say,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, faltering, â\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nmerely meant to explain to Aglaya Ivanovnaâ\\x80\\x94to have the honour to\\r\\nexplain, as it wereâ\\x80\\x94that I had no intentionâ\\x80\\x94never hadâ\\x80\\x94to ask the honour\\r\\nof her hand. I assure you I am not guilty, Aglaya Ivanovna, I am not,\\r\\nindeed. I never did wish toâ\\x80\\x94I never thought of it at allâ\\x80\\x94and never\\r\\nshallâ\\x80\\x94youâ\\x80\\x99ll see it yourselfâ\\x80\\x94you may be quite assured of it. Some\\r\\nwicked person has been maligning me to you; but itâ\\x80\\x99s all right. Donâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nworry about it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo saying, the prince approached Aglaya.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe took the handkerchief from her face, glanced keenly at him, took in\\r\\nwhat he had said, and burst out laughingâ\\x80\\x94such a merry, unrestrained\\r\\nlaugh, so hearty and gay, that Adelaida could not contain herself. She,\\r\\ntoo, glanced at the princeâ\\x80\\x99s panic-stricken countenance, then rushed at\\r\\nher sister, threw her arms round her neck, and burst into as merry a\\r\\nfit of laughter as Aglayaâ\\x80\\x99s own. They laughed together like a couple of\\r\\nschool-girls. Hearing and seeing this, the prince smiled happily, and\\r\\nin accents of relief and joy, he exclaimed â\\x80\\x9cWell, thank Godâ\\x80\\x94thank God!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAlexandra now joined in, and it looked as though the three sisters were\\r\\ngoing to laugh on for ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey are insane,â\\x80\\x9d muttered Lizabetha Prokofievna. â\\x80\\x9cEither they\\r\\nfrighten one out of oneâ\\x80\\x99s wits, or elseâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Prince S. was laughing now, too, so was Evgenie Pavlovitch, so was\\r\\nColia, and so was the prince himself, who caught the infection as he\\r\\nlooked round radiantly upon the others.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome along, letâ\\x80\\x99s go out for a walk!â\\x80\\x9d cried Adelaida. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99ll all go\\r\\ntogether, and the prince must absolutely go with us. You neednâ\\x80\\x99t go\\r\\naway, you dear good fellow! _Isnâ\\x80\\x99t_ he a dear, Aglaya? Isnâ\\x80\\x99t he,\\r\\nmother? I must really give him a kiss forâ\\x80\\x94for his explanation to Aglaya\\r\\njust now. Mother, dear, I may kiss him, maynâ\\x80\\x99t I? Aglaya, may I kiss\\r\\n_your_ prince?â\\x80\\x9d cried the young rogue, and sure enough she skipped up\\r\\nto the prince and kissed his forehead.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe seized her hands, and pressed them so hard that Adelaida nearly\\r\\ncried out; he then gazed with delight into her eyes, and raising her\\r\\nright hand to his lips with enthusiasm, kissed it three times.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome along,â\\x80\\x9d said Aglaya. â\\x80\\x9cPrince, you must walk with me. May he,\\r\\nmother? This young cavalier, who wonâ\\x80\\x99t have me? You said you would\\r\\n_never_ have me, didnâ\\x80\\x99t you, prince? Noâ\\x80\\x94no, not like that; _thatâ\\x80\\x99s_ not\\r\\nthe way to give your arm. Donâ\\x80\\x99t you know how to give your arm to a lady\\r\\nyet? Thereâ\\x80\\x94so. Now, come along, you and I will lead the way. Would you\\r\\nlike to lead the way with me alone, tÃªte-Ã\\xa0-tÃªte?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe went on talking and chatting without a pause, with occasional\\r\\nlittle bursts of laughter between.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank Godâ\\x80\\x94thank God!â\\x80\\x9d said Lizabetha Prokofievna to herself, without\\r\\nquite knowing why she felt so relieved.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat extraordinary people they are!â\\x80\\x9d thought Prince S., for perhaps\\r\\nthe hundredth time since he had entered into intimate relations with\\r\\nthe family; butâ\\x80\\x94he liked these â\\x80\\x9cextraordinary people,â\\x80\\x9d all the same. As\\r\\nfor Prince Lef Nicolaievitch himself, Prince S. did not seem quite to\\r\\nlike him, somehow. He was decidedly preoccupied and a little disturbed\\r\\nas they all started off.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvgenie Pavlovitch seemed to be in a lively humour. He made Adelaida\\r\\nand Alexandra laugh all the way to the Vauxhall; but they both laughed\\r\\nso very readily and promptly that the worthy Evgenie began at last to\\r\\nsuspect that they were not listening to him at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this idea, he burst out laughing all at once, in quite unaffected\\r\\nmirth, and without giving any explanation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sisters, who also appeared to be in high spirits, never tired of\\r\\nglancing at Aglaya and the prince, who were walking in front. It was\\r\\nevident that their younger sister was a thorough puzzle to them both.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrince S. tried hard to get up a conversation with Mrs. Epanchin upon\\r\\noutside subjects, probably with the good intention of distracting and\\r\\namusing her; but he bored her dreadfully. She was absent-minded to a\\r\\ndegree, and answered at cross purposes, and sometimes not at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the puzzle and mystery of Aglaya was not yet over for the evening.\\r\\nThe last exhibition fell to the lot of the prince alone. When they had\\r\\nproceeded some hundred paces or so from the house, Aglaya said to her\\r\\nobstinately silent cavalier in a quick half-whisper:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLook to the right!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince glanced in the direction indicated.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLook closer. Do you see that bench, in the park there, just by those\\r\\nthree big treesâ\\x80\\x94that green bench?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince replied that he saw it.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you like the position of it? Sometimes of a morning early, at seven\\r\\noâ\\x80\\x99clock, when all the rest are still asleep, I come out and sit there\\r\\nalone.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince muttered that the spot was a lovely one.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow, go away, I donâ\\x80\\x99t wish to have your arm any longer; or perhaps,\\r\\nbetter, continue to give me your arm, and walk along beside me, but\\r\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t speak a word to me. I wish to think by myself.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe warning was certainly unnecessary; for the prince would not have\\r\\nsaid a word all the rest of the time whether forbidden to speak or not.\\r\\nHis heart beat loud and painfully when Aglaya spoke of the bench; could\\r\\nsheâ\\x80\\x94but no! he banished the thought, after an instantâ\\x80\\x99s deliberation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Pavlofsk, on weekdays, the public is more select than it is on\\r\\nSundays and Saturdays, when the townsfolk come down to walk about and\\r\\nenjoy the park.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ladies dress elegantly, on these days, and it is the fashion to\\r\\ngather round the band, which is probably the best of our\\r\\npleasure-garden bands, and plays the newest pieces. The behaviour of\\r\\nthe public is most correct and proper, and there is an appearance of\\r\\nfriendly intimacy among the usual frequenters. Many come for nothing\\r\\nbut to look at their acquaintances, but there are others who come for\\r\\nthe sake of the music. It is very seldom that anything happens to break\\r\\nthe harmony of the proceedings, though, of course, accidents will\\r\\nhappen everywhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn this particular evening the weather was lovely, and there were a\\r\\nlarge number of people present. All the places anywhere near the\\r\\norchestra were occupied.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur friends took chairs near the side exit. The crowd and the music\\r\\ncheered Mrs. Epanchin a little, and amused the girls; they bowed and\\r\\nshook hands with some of their friends and nodded at a distance to\\r\\nothers; they examined the ladiesâ\\x80\\x99 dresses, noticed comicalities and\\r\\neccentricities among the people, and laughed and talked among\\r\\nthemselves. Evgenie Pavlovitch, too, found plenty of friends to bow to.\\r\\nSeveral people noticed Aglaya and the prince, who were still together.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore very long two or three young men had come up, and one or two\\r\\nremained to talk; all of these young men appeared to be on intimate\\r\\nterms with Evgenie Pavlovitch. Among them was a young officer, a\\r\\nremarkably handsome fellowâ\\x80\\x94very good-natured and a great chatterbox. He\\r\\ntried to get up a conversation with Aglaya, and did his best to secure\\r\\nher attention. Aglaya behaved very graciously to him, and chatted and\\r\\nlaughed merrily. Evgenie Pavlovitch begged the princeâ\\x80\\x99s leave to\\r\\nintroduce their friend to him. The prince hardly realized what was\\r\\nwanted of him, but the introduction came off; the two men bowed and\\r\\nshook hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvgenie Pavlovitchâ\\x80\\x99s friend asked the prince some question, but the\\r\\nlatter did not reply, or if he did, he muttered something so strangely\\r\\nindistinct that there was nothing to be made of it. The officer stared\\r\\nintently at him, then glanced at Evgenie, divined why the latter had\\r\\nintroduced him, and gave his undivided attention to Aglaya again. Only\\r\\nEvgenie Pavlovitch observed that Aglaya flushed up for a moment at\\r\\nthis.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince did not notice that others were talking and making\\r\\nthemselves agreeable to Aglaya; in fact, at moments, he almost forgot\\r\\nthat he was sitting by her himself. At other moments he felt a longing\\r\\nto go away somewhere and be alone with his thoughts, and to feel that\\r\\nno one knew where he was.\\r\\n\\r\\nOr if that were impossible he would like to be alone at home, on the\\r\\nterraceâ\\x80\\x94without either Lebedeff or his children, or anyone else about\\r\\nhim, and to lie there and thinkâ\\x80\\x94a day and night and another day again!\\r\\nHe thought of the mountainsâ\\x80\\x94and especially of a certain spot which he\\r\\nused to frequent, whence he would look down upon the distant valleys\\r\\nand fields, and see the waterfall, far off, like a little silver\\r\\nthread, and the old ruined castle in the distance. Oh! how he longed to\\r\\nbe there nowâ\\x80\\x94alone with his thoughtsâ\\x80\\x94to think of one thing all his\\r\\nlifeâ\\x80\\x94one thing! A thousand years would not be too much time! And let\\r\\neveryone here forget himâ\\x80\\x94forget him utterly! How much better it would\\r\\nhave been if they had never known himâ\\x80\\x94if all this could but prove to be\\r\\na dream. Perhaps it was a dream!\\r\\n\\r\\nNow and then he looked at Aglaya for five minutes at a time, without\\r\\ntaking his eyes off her face; but his expression was very strange; he\\r\\nwould gaze at her as though she were an object a couple of miles\\r\\ndistant, or as though he were looking at her portrait and not at\\r\\nherself at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy do you look at me like that, prince?â\\x80\\x9d she asked suddenly, breaking\\r\\noff her merry conversation and laughter with those about her. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m\\r\\nafraid of you! You look as though you were just going to put out your\\r\\nhand and touch my face to see if itâ\\x80\\x99s real! Doesnâ\\x80\\x99t he, Evgenie\\r\\nPavlovitchâ\\x80\\x94doesnâ\\x80\\x99t he look like that?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince seemed surprised that he should have been addressed at all;\\r\\nhe reflected a moment, but did not seem to take in what had been said\\r\\nto him; at all events, he did not answer. But observing that she and\\r\\nthe others had begun to laugh, he too opened his mouth and laughed with\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe laughter became general, and the young officer, who seemed a\\r\\nparticularly lively sort of person, simply shook with mirth.\\r\\n\\r\\nAglaya suddenly whispered angrily to herself the wordâ\\x80\\x94\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIdiot!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy goodnessâ\\x80\\x94surely she is not in love with such aâ\\x80\\x94surely she isnâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nmad!â\\x80\\x9d groaned Mrs. Epanchin, under her breath.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s all a joke, mamma; itâ\\x80\\x99s just a joke like the â\\x80\\x98poor\\r\\nknightâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x94nothing more whatever, I assure you!â\\x80\\x9d Alexandra whispered in\\r\\nher ear. â\\x80\\x9cShe is chaffing himâ\\x80\\x94making a fool of him, after her own\\r\\nprivate fashion, thatâ\\x80\\x99s all! But she carries it just a little too\\r\\nfarâ\\x80\\x94she is a regular little actress. How she frightened us just\\r\\nnowâ\\x80\\x94didnâ\\x80\\x99t she?â\\x80\\x94and all for a lark!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, itâ\\x80\\x99s lucky she has happened upon an idiot, then, thatâ\\x80\\x99s all I\\r\\ncan say!â\\x80\\x9d whispered Lizabetha Prokofievna, who was somewhat comforted,\\r\\nhowever, by her daughterâ\\x80\\x99s remark.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince had heard himself referred to as â\\x80\\x9cidiot,â\\x80\\x9d and had shuddered\\r\\nat the moment; but his shudder, it so happened, was not caused by the\\r\\nword applied to him. The fact was that in the crowd, not far from where\\r\\nhe was sitting, a pale familiar face, with curly black hair, and a\\r\\nwell-known smile and expression, had flashed across his vision for a\\r\\nmoment, and disappeared again. Very likely he had imagined it! There\\r\\nonly remained to him the impression of a strange smile, two eyes, and a\\r\\nbright green tie. Whether the man had disappeared among the crowd, or\\r\\nwhether he had turned towards the Vauxhall, the prince could not say.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut a moment or two afterwards he began to glance keenly about him.\\r\\nThat first vision might only too likely be the forerunner of a second;\\r\\nit was almost certain to be so. Surely he had not forgotten the\\r\\npossibility of such a meeting when he came to the Vauxhall? True\\r\\nenough, he had not remarked where he was coming to when he set out with\\r\\nAglaya; he had not been in a condition to remark anything at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad he been more careful to observe his companion, he would have seen\\r\\nthat for the last quarter of an hour Aglaya had also been glancing\\r\\naround in apparent anxiety, as though she expected to see someone, or\\r\\nsomething particular, among the crowd of people. Now, at the moment\\r\\nwhen his own anxiety became so marked, her excitement also increased\\r\\nvisibly, and when he looked about him, she did the same.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reason for their anxiety soon became apparent. From that very side\\r\\nentrance to the Vauxhall, near which the prince and all the Epanchin\\r\\nparty were seated, there suddenly appeared quite a large knot of\\r\\npersons, at least a dozen.\\r\\n\\r\\nHeading this little band walked three ladies, two of whom were\\r\\nremarkably lovely; and there was nothing surprising in the fact that\\r\\nthey should have had a large troop of admirers following in their wake.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there was something in the appearance of both the ladies and their\\r\\nadmirers which was peculiar, quite different for that of the rest of\\r\\nthe public assembled around the orchestra.\\r\\n\\r\\nNearly everyone observed the little band advancing, and all pretended\\r\\nnot to see or notice them, except a few young fellows who exchanged\\r\\nglances and smiled, saying something to one another in whispers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was impossible to avoid noticing them, however, in reality, for they\\r\\nmade their presence only too conspicuous by laughing and talking\\r\\nloudly. It was to be supposed that some of them were more than half\\r\\ndrunk, although they were well enough dressed, some even particularly\\r\\nwell. There were one or two, however, who were very strange-looking\\r\\ncreatures, with flushed faces and extraordinary clothes; some were\\r\\nmilitary men; not all were quite young; one or two were middle-aged\\r\\ngentlemen of decidedly disagreeable appearance, men who are avoided in\\r\\nsociety like the plague, decked out in large gold studs and rings, and\\r\\nmagnificently â\\x80\\x9cgot up,â\\x80\\x9d generally.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong our suburban resorts there are some which enjoy a specially high\\r\\nreputation for respectability and fashion; but the most careful\\r\\nindividual is not absolutely exempt from the danger of a tile falling\\r\\nsuddenly upon his head from his neighbourâ\\x80\\x99s roof.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch a tile was about to descend upon the elegant and decorous public\\r\\nnow assembled to hear the music.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to pass from the Vauxhall to the band-stand, the visitor has\\r\\nto descend two or three steps. Just at these steps the group paused, as\\r\\nthough it feared to proceed further; but very quickly one of the three\\r\\nladies, who formed its apex, stepped forward into the charmed circle,\\r\\nfollowed by two members of her suite.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of these was a middle-aged man of very respectable appearance, but\\r\\nwith the stamp of parvenu upon him, a man whom nobody knew, and who\\r\\nevidently knew nobody. The other follower was younger and far less\\r\\nrespectable-looking.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one else followed the eccentric lady; but as she descended the steps\\r\\nshe did not even look behind her, as though it were absolutely the same\\r\\nto her whether anyone were following or not. She laughed and talked\\r\\nloudly, however, just as before. She was dressed with great taste, but\\r\\nwith rather more magnificence than was needed for the occasion,\\r\\nperhaps.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe walked past the orchestra, to where an open carriage was waiting,\\r\\nnear the road.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince had not seen _her_ for more than three months. All these\\r\\ndays since his arrival from Petersburg he had intended to pay her a\\r\\nvisit, but some mysterious presentiment had restrained him. He could\\r\\nnot picture to himself what impression this meeting with her would make\\r\\nupon him, though he had often tried to imagine it, with fear and\\r\\ntrembling. One fact was quite certain, and that was that the meeting\\r\\nwould be painful.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral times during the last six months he had recalled the effect\\r\\nwhich the first sight of this face had had upon him, when he only saw\\r\\nits portrait. He recollected well that even the portrait face had left\\r\\nbut too painful an impression.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat month in the provinces, when he had seen this woman nearly every\\r\\nday, had affected him so deeply that he could not now look back upon it\\r\\ncalmly. In the very look of this woman there was something which\\r\\ntortured him. In conversation with Rogojin he had attributed this\\r\\nsensation to pityâ\\x80\\x94immeasurable pity, and this was the truth. The sight\\r\\nof the portrait face alone had filled his heart full of the agony of\\r\\nreal sympathy; and this feeling of sympathy, nay, of actual\\r\\n_suffering_, for her, had never left his heart since that hour, and was\\r\\nstill in full force. Oh yes, and more powerful than ever!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the prince was not satisfied with what he had said to Rogojin. Only\\r\\nat this moment, when she suddenly made her appearance before him, did\\r\\nhe realize to the full the exact emotion which she called up in him,\\r\\nand which he had not described correctly to Rogojin.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, indeed, there were no words in which he could have expressed his\\r\\nhorror, yes, _horror_, for he was now fully convinced from his own\\r\\nprivate knowledge of her, that the woman was mad.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf, loving a woman above everything in the world, or at least having a\\r\\nforetaste of the possibility of such love for her, one were suddenly to\\r\\nbehold her on a chain, behind bars and under the lash of a keeper, one\\r\\nwould feel something like what the poor prince now felt.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s the matter?â\\x80\\x9d asked Aglaya, in a whisper, giving his sleeve a\\r\\nlittle tug.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned his head towards her and glanced at her black and (for some\\r\\nreason) flashing eyes, tried to smile, and then, apparently forgetting\\r\\nher in an instant, turned to the right once more, and continued to\\r\\nwatch the startling apparition before him.\\r\\n\\r\\nNastasia Philipovna was at this moment passing the young ladiesâ\\x80\\x99\\r\\nchairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvgenie Pavlovitch continued some apparently extremely funny and\\r\\ninteresting anecdote to Alexandra, speaking quickly and with much\\r\\nanimation. The prince remembered that at this moment Aglaya remarked in\\r\\na half-whisper:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_What_ aâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe did not finish her indefinite sentence; she restrained herself in a\\r\\nmoment; but it was enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nNastasia Philipovna, who up to now had been walking along as though she\\r\\nhad not noticed the Epanchin party, suddenly turned her head in their\\r\\ndirection, as though she had just observed Evgenie Pavlovitch sitting\\r\\nthere for the first time.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, I declare, here he is!â\\x80\\x9d she cried, stopping suddenly. â\\x80\\x9cThe man\\r\\none canâ\\x80\\x99t find with all oneâ\\x80\\x99s messengers sent about the place, sitting\\r\\njust under oneâ\\x80\\x99s nose, exactly where one never thought of looking! I\\r\\nthought you were sure to be at your uncleâ\\x80\\x99s by this time.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEvgenie Pavlovitch flushed up and looked angrily at Nastasia\\r\\nPhilipovna, then turned his back on her.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat! donâ\\x80\\x99t you know about it yet? He doesnâ\\x80\\x99t knowâ\\x80\\x94imagine that! Why,\\r\\nheâ\\x80\\x99s shot himself. Your uncle shot himself this very morning. I was\\r\\ntold at two this afternoon. Half the town must know it by now. They say\\r\\nthere are three hundred and fifty thousand roubles, government money,\\r\\nmissing; some say five hundred thousand. And I was under the impression\\r\\nthat he would leave you a fortune! Heâ\\x80\\x99s whistled it all away. A most\\r\\ndepraved old gentleman, really! Well, ta, ta!â\\x80\\x94bonne chance! Surely you\\r\\nintend to be off there, donâ\\x80\\x99t you? Ha, ha! Youâ\\x80\\x99ve retired from the army\\r\\nin good time, I see! Plain clothes! Well done, sly rogue! Nonsense! I\\r\\nseeâ\\x80\\x94you knew it all beforeâ\\x80\\x94I dare say you knew all about it yesterday-â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the impudence of this attack, this public proclamation of\\r\\nintimacy, as it were, was doubtless premeditated, and had its special\\r\\nobject, yet Evgenie Pavlovitch at first seemed to intend to make no\\r\\nshow of observing either his tormentor or her words. But Nastasiaâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ncommunication struck him with the force of a thunderclap. On hearing of\\r\\nhis uncleâ\\x80\\x99s death he suddenly grew as white as a sheet, and turned\\r\\ntowards his informant.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this moment, Lizabetha Prokofievna rose swiftly from her seat,\\r\\nbeckoned her companions, and left the place almost at a run.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly the prince stopped behind for a moment, as though in indecision;\\r\\nand Evgenie Pavlovitch lingered too, for he had not collected his\\r\\nscattered wits. But the Epanchins had not had time to get more than\\r\\ntwenty paces away when a scandalous episode occurred. The young\\r\\nofficer, Evgenie Pavlovitchâ\\x80\\x99s friend who had been conversing with\\r\\nAglaya, said aloud in a great state of indignation:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe ought to be whippedâ\\x80\\x94thatâ\\x80\\x99s the only way to deal with creatures\\r\\nlike thatâ\\x80\\x94she ought to be whipped!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis gentleman was a confidant of Evgenieâ\\x80\\x99s, and had doubtless heard of\\r\\nthe carriage episode.\\r\\n\\r\\nNastasia turned to him. Her eyes flashed; she rushed up to a young man\\r\\nstanding near, whom she did not know in the least, but who happened to\\r\\nhave in his hand a thin cane. Seizing this from him, she brought it\\r\\nwith all her force across the face of her insulter.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this occurred, of course, in one instant of time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young officer, forgetting himself, sprang towards her. Nastasiaâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nfollowers were not by her at the moment (the elderly gentleman having\\r\\ndisappeared altogether, and the younger man simply standing aside and\\r\\nroaring with laughter).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn another moment, of course, the police would have been on the spot,\\r\\nand it would have gone hard with Nastasia Philipovna had not unexpected\\r\\naid appeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuishkin, who was but a couple of steps away, had time to spring\\r\\nforward and seize the officerâ\\x80\\x99s arms from behind.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe officer, tearing himself from the princeâ\\x80\\x99s grasp, pushed him so\\r\\nviolently backwards that he staggered a few steps and then subsided\\r\\ninto a chair.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there were other defenders for Nastasia on the spot by this time.\\r\\nThe gentleman known as the â\\x80\\x9cboxerâ\\x80\\x9d now confronted the enraged officer.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cKeller is my name, sir; ex-lieutenant,â\\x80\\x9d he said, very loud. â\\x80\\x9cIf you\\r\\nwill accept me as champion of the fair sex, I am at your disposal.\\r\\nEnglish boxing has no secrets from me. I sympathize with you for the\\r\\ninsult you have received, but I canâ\\x80\\x99t permit you to raise your hand\\r\\nagainst a woman in public. If you prefer to meet meâ\\x80\\x94as would be more\\r\\nfitting to your rankâ\\x80\\x94in some other manner, of course you understand me,\\r\\ncaptain.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the young officer had recovered himself, and was no longer\\r\\nlistening. At this moment Rogojin appeared, elbowing through the crowd;\\r\\nhe took Nastasiaâ\\x80\\x99s hand, drew it through his arm, and quickly led her\\r\\naway. He appeared to be terribly excited; he was trembling all over,\\r\\nand was as pale as a corpse. As he carried Nastasia off, he turned and\\r\\ngrinned horribly in the officerâ\\x80\\x99s face, and with low malice observed:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTfu! look what the fellow got! Look at the blood on his cheek! Ha,\\r\\nha!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRecollecting himself, however, and seeing at a glance the sort of\\r\\npeople he had to deal with, the officer turned his back on both his\\r\\nopponents, and courteously, but concealing his face with his\\r\\nhandkerchief, approached the prince, who was now rising from the chair\\r\\ninto which he had fallen.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPrince Muishkin, I believe? The gentleman to whom I had the honour of\\r\\nbeing introduced?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe is mad, insaneâ\\x80\\x94I assure you, she is mad,â\\x80\\x9d replied the prince in\\r\\ntrembling tones, holding out both his hands mechanically towards the\\r\\nofficer.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI cannot boast of any such knowledge, of course, but I wished to know\\r\\nyour name.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe bowed and retired without waiting for an answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nFive seconds after the disappearance of the last actor in this scene,\\r\\nthe police arrived. The whole episode had not lasted more than a couple\\r\\nof minutes. Some of the spectators had risen from their places, and\\r\\ndeparted altogether; some merely exchanged their seats for others a\\r\\nlittle further off; some were delighted with the occurrence, and talked\\r\\nand laughed over it for a long time.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a word, the incident closed as such incidents do, and the band began\\r\\nto play again. The prince walked away after the Epanchin party. Had he\\r\\nthought of looking round to the left after he had been pushed so\\r\\nunceremoniously into the chair, he would have observed Aglaya standing\\r\\nsome twenty yards away. She had stayed to watch the scandalous scene in\\r\\nspite of her motherâ\\x80\\x99s and sistersâ\\x80\\x99 anxious cries to her to come away.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrince S. ran up to her and persuaded her, at last, to come home with\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nLizabetha Prokofievna saw that she returned in such a state of\\r\\nagitation that it was doubtful whether she had even heard their calls.\\r\\nBut only a couple of minutes later, when they had reached the park,\\r\\nAglaya suddenly remarked, in her usual calm, indifferent voice:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI wanted to see how the farce would end.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe occurrence at the Vauxhall had filled both mother and daughters\\r\\nwith something like horror. In their excitement Lizabetha Prokofievna\\r\\nand the girls were nearly running all the way home.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn her opinion there was so much disclosed and laid bare by the\\r\\nepisode, that, in spite of the chaotic condition of her mind, she was\\r\\nable to feel more or less decided on certain points which, up to now,\\r\\nhad been in a cloudy condition.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, one and all of the party realized that something important had\\r\\nhappened, and that, perhaps fortunately enough, something which had\\r\\nhitherto been enveloped in the obscurity of guess-work had now begun to\\r\\ncome forth a little from the mists. In spite of Prince S.â\\x80\\x98s assurances\\r\\nand explanations, Evgenie Pavlovitchâ\\x80\\x99s real character and position were\\r\\nat last coming to light. He was publicly convicted of intimacy with\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthat creature.â\\x80\\x9d So thought Lizabetha Prokofievna and her two elder\\r\\ndaughters.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the real upshot of the business was that the number of riddles to\\r\\nbe solved was augmented. The two girls, though rather irritated at\\r\\ntheir motherâ\\x80\\x99s exaggerated alarm and haste to depart from the scene,\\r\\nhad been unwilling to worry her at first with questions.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides, they could not help thinking that their sister Aglaya probably\\r\\nknew more about the whole matter than both they and their mother put\\r\\ntogether.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrince S. looked as black as night, and was silent and moody. Mrs.\\r\\nEpanchin did not say a word to him all the way home, and he did not\\r\\nseem to observe the fact. Adelaida tried to pump him a little by\\r\\nasking, â\\x80\\x9cwho was the uncle they were talking about, and what was it\\r\\nthat had happened in Petersburg?â\\x80\\x9d But he had merely muttered something\\r\\ndisconnected about â\\x80\\x9cmaking inquiries,â\\x80\\x9d and that â\\x80\\x9cof course it was all\\r\\nnonsense.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cOh, of course,â\\x80\\x9d replied Adelaida, and asked no more\\r\\nquestions. Aglaya, too, was very quiet; and the only remark she made on\\r\\nthe way home was that they were â\\x80\\x9cwalking much too fast to be pleasant.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce she turned and observed the prince hurrying after them. Noticing\\r\\nhis anxiety to catch them up, she smiled ironically, and then looked\\r\\nback no more. At length, just as they neared the house, General\\r\\nEpanchin came out and met them; he had only just arrived from town.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis first word was to inquire after Evgenie Pavlovitch. But Lizabetha\\r\\nstalked past him, and neither looked at him nor answered his question.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe immediately judged from the faces of his daughters and Prince S.\\r\\nthat there was a thunderstorm brewing, and he himself already bore\\r\\nevidences of unusual perturbation of mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe immediately button-holed Prince S., and standing at the front door,\\r\\nengaged in a whispered conversation with him. By the troubled aspect of\\r\\nboth of them, when they entered the house, and approached Mrs.\\r\\nEpanchin, it was evident that they had been discussing very disturbing\\r\\nnews.\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle by little the family gathered together upstairs in Lizabetha\\r\\nProkofievnaâ\\x80\\x99s apartments, and Prince Muishkin found himself alone on\\r\\nthe verandah when he arrived. He settled himself in a corner and sat\\r\\nwaiting, though he knew not what he expected. It never struck him that\\r\\nhe had better go away, with all this disturbance in the house. He\\r\\nseemed to have forgotten all the world, and to be ready to sit on where\\r\\nhe was for years on end. From upstairs he caught sounds of excited\\r\\nconversation every now and then.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe could not say how long he sat there. It grew late and became quite\\r\\ndark.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly Aglaya entered the verandah. She seemed to be quite calm,\\r\\nthough a little pale.\\r\\n\\r\\nObserving the prince, whom she evidently did not expect to see there,\\r\\nalone in the corner, she smiled, and approached him:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat are you doing there?â\\x80\\x9d she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince muttered something, blushed, and jumped up; but Aglaya\\r\\nimmediately sat down beside him; so he reseated himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked suddenly, but attentively into his face, then at the window,\\r\\nas though thinking of something else, and then again at him.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPerhaps she wants to laugh at me,â\\x80\\x9d thought the prince, â\\x80\\x9cbut no; for if\\r\\nshe did she certainly would do so.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWould you like some tea? Iâ\\x80\\x99ll order some,â\\x80\\x9d she said, after a minute or\\r\\ntwo of silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cN-no thanks, I donâ\\x80\\x99t knowâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t know! How can you not know? By-the-by, look hereâ\\x80\\x94if someone were\\r\\nto challenge you to a duel, what should you do? I wished to ask you\\r\\nthisâ\\x80\\x94some time agoâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy? Nobody would ever challenge me to a duel!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut if they were to, would you be dreadfully frightened?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI dare say I should beâ\\x80\\x94much alarmed!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSeriously? Then are you a coward?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cN-no!â\\x80\\x94I donâ\\x80\\x99t think so. A coward is a man who is afraid and runs away;\\r\\nthe man who is frightened but does not run away, is not quite a\\r\\ncoward,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince with a smile, after a momentâ\\x80\\x99s thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd you wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t run away?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNoâ\\x80\\x94I donâ\\x80\\x99t think I should run away,â\\x80\\x9d replied the prince, laughing\\r\\noutright at last at Aglayaâ\\x80\\x99s questions.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThough I am a woman, I should certainly not run away for anything,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nsaid Aglaya, in a slightly pained voice. â\\x80\\x9cHowever, I see you are\\r\\nlaughing at me and twisting your face up as usual in order to make\\r\\nyourself look more interesting. Now tell me, they generally shoot at\\r\\ntwenty paces, donâ\\x80\\x99t they? At ten, sometimes? I suppose if at ten they\\r\\nmust be either wounded or killed, mustnâ\\x80\\x99t they?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t think they often kill each other at duels.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey killed Pushkin that way.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat may have been an accident.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot a bit of it; it was a duel to the death, and he was killed.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe bullet struck so low down that probably his antagonist would never\\r\\nhave aimed at that part of himâ\\x80\\x94people never do; he would have aimed at\\r\\nhis chest or head; so that probably the bullet hit him accidentally. I\\r\\nhave been told this by competent authorities.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, a soldier once told me that they were always ordered to aim at\\r\\nthe middle of the body. So you see they donâ\\x80\\x99t aim at the chest or head;\\r\\nthey aim lower on purpose. I asked some officer about this afterwards,\\r\\nand he said it was perfectly true.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is probably when they fire from a long distance.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCan you shoot at all?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I have never shot in my life.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCanâ\\x80\\x99t you even load a pistol?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo! That is, I understand how itâ\\x80\\x99s done, of course, but I have never\\r\\ndone it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen, you donâ\\x80\\x99t know how, for it is a matter that needs practice. Now\\r\\nlisten and learn; in the first place buy good powder, not damp (they\\r\\nsay it mustnâ\\x80\\x99t be at all damp, but very dry), some fine kind it isâ\\x80\\x94you\\r\\nmust ask for _pistol_ powder, not the stuff they load cannons with.\\r\\nThey say one makes the bullets oneself, somehow or other. Have you got\\r\\na pistol?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNoâ\\x80\\x94and I donâ\\x80\\x99t want one,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, laughing.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, what _nonsense!_ You must buy one. French or English are the best,\\r\\nthey say. Then take a little powder, about a thimbleful, or perhaps\\r\\ntwo, and pour it into the barrel. Better put plenty. Then push in a bit\\r\\nof felt (it _must_ be felt, for some reason or other); you can easily\\r\\nget a bit off some old mattress, or off a door; itâ\\x80\\x99s used to keep the\\r\\ncold out. Well, when you have pushed the felt down, put the bullet in;\\r\\ndo you hear now? The bullet last and the powder first, not the other\\r\\nway, or the pistol wonâ\\x80\\x99t shoot. What are you laughing at? I wish you to\\r\\nbuy a pistol and practise every day, and you must learn to hit a mark\\r\\nfor _certain_; will you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince only laughed. Aglaya stamped her foot with annoyance.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer serious air, however, during this conversation had surprised him\\r\\nconsiderably. He had a feeling that he ought to be asking her\\r\\nsomething, that there was something he wanted to find out far more\\r\\nimportant than how to load a pistol; but his thoughts had all\\r\\nscattered, and he was only aware that she was sitting by him, and\\r\\ntalking to him, and that he was looking at her; as to what she happened\\r\\nto be saying to him, that did not matter in the least.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general now appeared on the verandah, coming from upstairs. He was\\r\\non his way out, with an expression of determination on his face, and of\\r\\npreoccupation and worry also.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh! Lef Nicolaievitch, itâ\\x80\\x99s you, is it? Where are you off to now?â\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nasked, oblivious of the fact that the prince had not showed the least\\r\\nsign of moving. â\\x80\\x9cCome along with me; I want to say a word or two to\\r\\nyou.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Au revoir_, then!â\\x80\\x9d said Aglaya, holding out her hand to the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was quite dark now, and Muishkin could not see her face clearly, but\\r\\na minute or two later, when he and the general had left the villa, he\\r\\nsuddenly flushed up, and squeezed his right hand tightly.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt appeared that he and the general were going in the same direction.\\r\\nIn spite of the lateness of the hour, the general was hurrying away to\\r\\ntalk to someone upon some important subject. Meanwhile he talked\\r\\nincessantly but disconnectedly to the prince, and continually brought\\r\\nin the name of Lizabetha Prokofievna.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the prince had been in a condition to pay more attention to what the\\r\\ngeneral was saying, he would have discovered that the latter was\\r\\ndesirous of drawing some information out of him, or indeed of asking\\r\\nhim some question outright; but that he could not make up his mind to\\r\\ncome to the point.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuishkin was so absent, that from the very first he could not attend to\\r\\na word the other was saying; and when the general suddenly stopped\\r\\nbefore him with some excited question, he was obliged to confess,\\r\\nignominiously, that he did not know in the least what he had been\\r\\ntalking about.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general shrugged his shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow strange everyone, yourself included, has become of late,â\\x80\\x9d said he.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was telling you that I cannot in the least understand Lizabetha\\r\\nProkofievnaâ\\x80\\x99s ideas and agitations. She is in hysterics up there, and\\r\\nmoans and says that we have been â\\x80\\x98shamed and disgraced.â\\x80\\x99 How? Why?\\r\\nWhen? By whom? I confess that I am very much to blame myself; I do not\\r\\nconceal the fact; but the conduct, the outrageous behaviour of this\\r\\nwoman, must really be kept within limits, by the police if necessary,\\r\\nand I am just on my way now to talk the question over and make some\\r\\narrangements. It can all be managed quietly and gently, even kindly,\\r\\nand without the slightest fuss or scandal. I foresee that the future is\\r\\npregnant with events, and that there is much that needs explanation.\\r\\nThere is intrigue in the wind; but if on one side nothing is known, on\\r\\nthe other side nothing will be explained. If I have heard nothing about\\r\\nit, nor have _you_, nor _he_, nor _she_â\\x80\\x94who _has_ heard about it, I\\r\\nshould like to know? How _can_ all this be explained except by the fact\\r\\nthat half of it is mirage or moonshine, or some hallucination of that\\r\\nsort?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_She_ is insane,â\\x80\\x9d muttered the prince, suddenly recollecting all that\\r\\nhad passed, with a spasm of pain at his heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI too had that idea, and I slept in peace. But now I see that their\\r\\nopinion is more correct. I do not believe in the theory of madness! The\\r\\nwoman has no common sense; but she is not only not insane, she is\\r\\nartful to a degree. Her outburst of this evening about Evgenieâ\\x80\\x99s uncle\\r\\nproves that conclusively. It was _villainous_, simply jesuitical, and\\r\\nit was all for some special purpose.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat about Evgenieâ\\x80\\x99s uncle?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy goodness, Lef Nicolaievitch, why, you canâ\\x80\\x99t have heard a single\\r\\nword I said! Look at me, Iâ\\x80\\x99m still trembling all over with the dreadful\\r\\nshock! It is that that kept me in town so late. Evgenie Pavlovitchâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nuncleâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell?â\\x80\\x9d cried the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShot himself this morning, at seven oâ\\x80\\x99clock. A respected, eminent old\\r\\nman of seventy; and exactly point for point as she described it; a sum\\r\\nof money, a considerable sum of government money, missing!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, how could sheâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat, know of it? Ha, ha, ha! Why, there was a whole crowd round her\\r\\nthe moment she appeared on the scenes here. You know what sort of\\r\\npeople surround her nowadays, and solicit the honour of her\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98acquaintance.â\\x80\\x99 Of course she might easily have heard the news from\\r\\nsomeone coming from town. All Petersburg, if not all Pavlofsk, knows it\\r\\nby now. Look at the slyness of her observation about Evgenieâ\\x80\\x99s uniform!\\r\\nI mean, her remark that he had retired just in time! Thereâ\\x80\\x99s a venomous\\r\\nhint for you, if you like! No, no! thereâ\\x80\\x99s no insanity there! Of course\\r\\nI refuse to believe that Evgenie Pavlovitch could have known beforehand\\r\\nof the catastrophe; that is, that at such and such a day at seven\\r\\noâ\\x80\\x99clock, and all that; but he might well have had a presentiment of the\\r\\ntruth. And Iâ\\x80\\x94all of usâ\\x80\\x94Prince S. and everybody, believed that he was to\\r\\ninherit a large fortune from this uncle. Itâ\\x80\\x99s dreadful, horrible! Mind,\\r\\nI donâ\\x80\\x99t suspect Evgenie of anything, be quite clear on that point; but\\r\\nthe thing is a little suspicious, nevertheless. Prince S. canâ\\x80\\x99t get\\r\\nover it. Altogether it is a very extraordinary combination of\\r\\ncircumstances.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat suspicion attaches to Evgenie Pavlovitch?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, none at all! He has behaved very well indeed. I didnâ\\x80\\x99t mean to\\r\\ndrop any sort of hint. His own fortune is intact, I believe. Lizabetha\\r\\nProkofievna, of course, refuses to listen to anything. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s the worst\\r\\nof it all, these family catastrophes or quarrels, or whatever you like\\r\\nto call them. You know, prince, you are a friend of the family, so I\\r\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t mind telling you; it now appears that Evgenie Pavlovitch proposed\\r\\nto Aglaya a month ago, and was refused.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cImpossible!â\\x80\\x9d cried the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy? Do you know anything about it? Look here,â\\x80\\x9d continued the general,\\r\\nmore agitated than ever, and trembling with excitement, â\\x80\\x9cmaybe I have\\r\\nbeen letting the cat out of the bag too freely with you, if so, it is\\r\\nbecause you areâ\\x80\\x94that sort of man, you know! Perhaps you have some\\r\\nspecial information?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know nothing about Evgenie Pavlovitch!â\\x80\\x9d said the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNor do I! They always try to bury me underground when thereâ\\x80\\x99s anything\\r\\ngoing on; they donâ\\x80\\x99t seem to reflect that it is unpleasant to a man to\\r\\nbe treated so! I wonâ\\x80\\x99t stand it! We have just had a terrible\\r\\nscene!â\\x80\\x94mind, I speak to you as I would to my own son! Aglaya laughs at\\r\\nher mother. Her sisters guessed about Evgenie having proposed and been\\r\\nrejected, and told Lizabetha.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI tell you, my dear fellow, Aglaya is such an extraordinary, such a\\r\\nself-willed, fantastical little creature, you wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t believe it!\\r\\nEvery high quality, every brilliant trait of heart and mind, are to be\\r\\nfound in her, and, with it all, so much caprice and mockery, such wild\\r\\nfanciesâ\\x80\\x94indeed, a little devil! She has just been laughing at her\\r\\nmother to her very face, and at her sisters, and at Prince S., and\\r\\neverybodyâ\\x80\\x94and of course she always laughs at me! You know I love the\\r\\nchildâ\\x80\\x94I love her even when she laughs at me, and I believe the wild\\r\\nlittle creature has a special fondness for me for that very reason. She\\r\\nis fonder of me than any of the others. I dare swear she has had a good\\r\\nlaugh at _you_ before now! You were having a quiet talk just now, I\\r\\nobserved, after all the thunder and lightning upstairs. She was sitting\\r\\nwith you just as though there had been no row at all.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince blushed painfully in the darkness, and closed his right hand\\r\\ntightly, but he said nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear good Prince Lef Nicolaievitch,â\\x80\\x9d began the general again,\\r\\nsuddenly, â\\x80\\x9cboth I and Lizabetha Prokofievnaâ\\x80\\x94(who has begun to respect\\r\\nyou once more, and me through you, goodness knows why!)â\\x80\\x94we both love\\r\\nyou very sincerely, and esteem you, in spite of any appearances to the\\r\\ncontrary. But youâ\\x80\\x99ll admit what a riddle it must have been for us when\\r\\nthat calm, cold, little spitfire, Aglayaâ\\x80\\x94(for she stood up to her\\r\\nmother and answered her questions with inexpressible contempt, and mine\\r\\nstill more so, because, like a fool, I thought it my duty to assert\\r\\nmyself as head of the family)â\\x80\\x94when Aglaya stood up of a sudden and\\r\\ninformed us that â\\x80\\x98that madwomanâ\\x80\\x99 (strangely enough, she used exactly\\r\\nthe same expression as you did) â\\x80\\x98has taken it into her head to marry me\\r\\nto Prince Lef Nicolaievitch, and therefore is doing her best to choke\\r\\nEvgenie Pavlovitch off, and rid the house of him.â\\x80\\x99 Thatâ\\x80\\x99s what she\\r\\nsaid. She would not give the slightest explanation; she burst out\\r\\nlaughing, banged the door, and went away. We all stood there with our\\r\\nmouths open. Well, I was told afterwards of your little passage with\\r\\nAglaya this afternoon, andâ\\x80\\x94andâ\\x80\\x94dear princeâ\\x80\\x94you are a good, sensible\\r\\nfellow, donâ\\x80\\x99t be angry if I speak outâ\\x80\\x94she is laughing at you, my boy!\\r\\nShe is enjoying herself like a child, at your expense, and therefore,\\r\\nsince she is a child, donâ\\x80\\x99t be angry with her, and donâ\\x80\\x99t think anything\\r\\nof it. I assure you, she is simply making a fool of you, just as she\\r\\ndoes with one and all of us out of pure lack of something better to do.\\r\\nWellâ\\x80\\x94good-bye! You know our feelings, donâ\\x80\\x99t youâ\\x80\\x94our sincere feelings\\r\\nfor yourself? They are unalterable, you know, dear boy, under all\\r\\ncircumstances, butâ\\x80\\x94Well, here we part; I must go down to the right.\\r\\nRarely have I sat so uncomfortably in my saddle, as they say, as I now\\r\\nsit. And people talk of the charms of a country holiday!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLeft to himself at the cross-roads, the prince glanced around him,\\r\\nquickly crossed the road towards the lighted window of a neighbouring\\r\\nhouse, and unfolded a tiny scrap of paper which he had held clasped in\\r\\nhis right hand during the whole of his conversation with the general.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe read the note in the uncertain rays that fell from the window. It\\r\\nwas as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTomorrow morning, I shall be at the green bench in the park at seven,\\r\\nand shall wait there for you. I have made up my mind to speak to you\\r\\nabout a most important matter which closely concerns yourself.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cP.S.â\\x80\\x94I trust that you will not show this note to anyone. Though I am\\r\\nashamed of giving you such instructions, I feel that I must do so,\\r\\nconsidering what you are. I therefore write the words, and blush for\\r\\nyour simple character.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cP.P.S.â\\x80\\x94It is the same green bench that I showed you before. There!\\r\\narenâ\\x80\\x99t you ashamed of yourself? I felt that it was necessary to repeat\\r\\neven that information.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe note was written and folded anyhow, evidently in a great hurry, and\\r\\nprobably just before Aglaya had come down to the verandah.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn inexpressible agitation, amounting almost to fear, the prince\\r\\nslipped quickly away from the window, away from the light, like a\\r\\nfrightened thief, but as he did so he collided violently with some\\r\\ngentleman who seemed to spring from the earth at his feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was watching for you, prince,â\\x80\\x9d said the individual.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs that you, Keller?â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, in surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been looking for you. I waited for you at the Epanchinsâ\\x80\\x99\\r\\nhouse, but of course I could not come in. I dogged you from behind as\\r\\nyou walked along with the general. Well, prince, here is Keller,\\r\\nabsolutely at your serviceâ\\x80\\x94command him!â\\x80\\x94ready to sacrifice himselfâ\\x80\\x94even\\r\\nto die in case of need.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cButâ\\x80\\x94why?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, why?â\\x80\\x94Of course youâ\\x80\\x99ll be challenged! That was young Lieutenant\\r\\nMoloftsoff. I know him, or rather of him; he wonâ\\x80\\x99t pass an insult. He\\r\\nwill take no notice of Rogojin and myself, and, therefore, you are the\\r\\nonly one left to account for. Youâ\\x80\\x99ll have to pay the piper, prince. He\\r\\nhas been asking about you, and undoubtedly his friend will call on you\\r\\ntomorrowâ\\x80\\x94perhaps he is at your house already. If you would do me the\\r\\nhonour to have me for a second, prince, I should be happy. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s why I\\r\\nhave been looking for you now.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDuel! Youâ\\x80\\x99ve come to talk about a duel, too!â\\x80\\x9d The prince burst out\\r\\nlaughing, to the great astonishment of Keller. He laughed\\r\\nunrestrainedly, and Keller, who had been on pins and needles, and in a\\r\\nfever of excitement to offer himself as â\\x80\\x9csecond,â\\x80\\x9d was very near being\\r\\noffended.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou caught him by the arms, you know, prince. No man of proper pride\\r\\ncan stand that sort of treatment in public.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, and he gave me a fearful dig in the chest,â\\x80\\x9d cried the prince,\\r\\nstill laughing. â\\x80\\x9cWhat are we to fight about? I shall beg his pardon,\\r\\nthatâ\\x80\\x99s all. But if we must fightâ\\x80\\x94weâ\\x80\\x99ll fight! Let him have a shot at\\r\\nme, by all means; I should rather like it. Ha, ha, ha! I know how to\\r\\nload a pistol now; do you know how to load a pistol, Keller? First, you\\r\\nhave to buy the powder, you know; it mustnâ\\x80\\x99t be wet, and it mustnâ\\x80\\x99t be\\r\\nthat coarse stuff that they load cannons withâ\\x80\\x94it must be pistol powder.\\r\\nThen you pour the powder in, and get hold of a bit of felt from some\\r\\ndoor, and then shove the bullet in. But donâ\\x80\\x99t shove the bullet in\\r\\nbefore the powder, because the thing wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t go offâ\\x80\\x94do you hear,\\r\\nKeller, the thing wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t go off! Ha, ha, ha! Isnâ\\x80\\x99t that a grand\\r\\nreason, Keller, my friend, eh? Do you know, my dear fellow, I really\\r\\nmust kiss you, and embrace you, this very moment. Ha, ha! How was it\\r\\nyou so suddenly popped up in front of me as you did? Come to my house\\r\\nas soon as you can, and weâ\\x80\\x99ll have some champagne. Weâ\\x80\\x99ll all get drunk!\\r\\nDo you know I have a dozen of champagne in Lebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s cellar? Lebedeff\\r\\nsold them to me the day after I arrived. I took the lot. Weâ\\x80\\x99ll invite\\r\\neverybody! Are you going to do any sleeping tonight?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAs much as usual, princeâ\\x80\\x94why?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPleasant dreams thenâ\\x80\\x94ha, ha!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince crossed the road, and disappeared into the park, leaving the\\r\\nastonished Keller in a state of ludicrous wonder. He had never before\\r\\nseen the prince in such a strange condition of mind, and could not have\\r\\nimagined the possibility of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFever, probably,â\\x80\\x9d he said to himself, â\\x80\\x9cfor the man is all nerves, and\\r\\nthis business has been a little too much for him. He is not _afraid_,\\r\\nthatâ\\x80\\x99s clear; that sort never funks! Hâ\\x80\\x99m! champagne! That was an\\r\\ninteresting item of news, at all events!â\\x80\\x94Twelve bottles! Dear me,\\r\\nthatâ\\x80\\x99s a very respectable little stock indeed! I bet anything Lebedeff\\r\\nlent somebody money on deposit of this dozen of champagne. Hum! heâ\\x80\\x99s a\\r\\nnice fellow, is this prince! I like this sort of man. Well, I neednâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nbe wasting time here, and if itâ\\x80\\x99s a case of champagne, whyâ\\x80\\x94thereâ\\x80\\x99s no\\r\\ntime like the present!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThat the prince was almost in a fever was no more than the truth. He\\r\\nwandered about the park for a long while, and at last came to himself\\r\\nin a lonely avenue. He was vaguely conscious that he had already paced\\r\\nthis particular walkâ\\x80\\x94from that large, dark tree to the bench at the\\r\\nother endâ\\x80\\x94about a hundred yards altogetherâ\\x80\\x94at least thirty times\\r\\nbackwards and forwards.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to recollecting what he had been thinking of all that time, he could\\r\\nnot. He caught himself, however, indulging in one thought which made\\r\\nhim roar with laughter, though there was nothing really to laugh at in\\r\\nit; but he felt that he must laugh, and go on laughing.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt struck him that the idea of the duel might not have occurred to\\r\\nKeller alone, but that his lesson in the art of pistol-loading might\\r\\nhave been not altogether accidental! â\\x80\\x9cPooh! nonsense!â\\x80\\x9d he said to\\r\\nhimself, struck by another thought, of a sudden. â\\x80\\x9cWhy, she was\\r\\nimmensely surprised to find me there on the verandah, and laughed and\\r\\ntalked about _tea!_ And yet she had this little note in her hand,\\r\\ntherefore she must have known that I was sitting there. So why was she\\r\\nsurprised? Ha, ha, ha!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe pulled the note out and kissed it; then paused and reflected. â\\x80\\x9cHow\\r\\nstrange it all is! how strange!â\\x80\\x9d he muttered, melancholy enough now. In\\r\\nmoments of great joy, he invariably felt a sensation of melancholy come\\r\\nover himâ\\x80\\x94he could not tell why.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked intently around him, and wondered why he had come here; he\\r\\nwas very tired, so he approached the bench and sat down on it. Around\\r\\nhim was profound silence; the music in the Vauxhall was over. The park\\r\\nseemed quite empty, though it was not, in reality, later than half-past\\r\\neleven. It was a quiet, warm, clear nightâ\\x80\\x94a real Petersburg night of\\r\\nearly June; but in the dense avenue, where he was sitting, it was\\r\\nalmost pitch dark.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf anyone had come up at this moment and told him that he was in love,\\r\\npassionately in love, he would have rejected the idea with\\r\\nastonishment, and, perhaps, with irritation. And if anyone had added\\r\\nthat Aglayaâ\\x80\\x99s note was a love-letter, and that it contained an\\r\\nappointment to a loverâ\\x80\\x99s rendezvous, he would have blushed with shame\\r\\nfor the speaker, and, probably, have challenged him to a duel.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this would have been perfectly sincere on his part. He had never\\r\\nfor a moment entertained the idea of the possibility of this girl\\r\\nloving him, or even of such a thing as himself falling in love with\\r\\nher. The possibility of being loved himself, â\\x80\\x9ca man like me,â\\x80\\x9d as he put\\r\\nit, he ranked among ridiculous suppositions. It appeared to him that it\\r\\nwas simply a joke on Aglayaâ\\x80\\x99s part, if there really were anything in it\\r\\nat all; but that seemed to him quite natural. His preoccupation was\\r\\ncaused by something different.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to the few words which the general had let slip about Aglaya\\r\\nlaughing at everybody, and at himself most of allâ\\x80\\x94he entirely believed\\r\\nthem. He did not feel the slightest sensation of offence; on the\\r\\ncontrary, he was quite certain that it was as it should be.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis whole thoughts were now as to next morning early; he would see her;\\r\\nhe would sit by her on that little green bench, and listen to how\\r\\npistols were loaded, and look at her. He wanted nothing more.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe question as to what she might have to say of special interest to\\r\\nhimself occurred to him once or twice. He did not doubt, for a moment,\\r\\nthat she really had some such subject of conversation in store, but so\\r\\nvery little interested in the matter was he that it did not strike him\\r\\nto wonder what it could be. The crunch of gravel on the path suddenly\\r\\ncaused him to raise his head.\\r\\n\\r\\nA man, whose face it was difficult to see in the gloom, approached the\\r\\nbench, and sat down beside him. The prince peered into his face, and\\r\\nrecognized the livid features of Rogojin.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI knew youâ\\x80\\x99d be wandering about somewhere here. I didnâ\\x80\\x99t have to look\\r\\nfor you very long,â\\x80\\x9d muttered the latter between his teeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the first time they had met since the encounter on the staircase\\r\\nat the hotel.\\r\\n\\r\\nPainfully surprised as he was at this sudden apparition of Rogojin, the\\r\\nprince, for some little while, was unable to collect his thoughts.\\r\\nRogojin, evidently, saw and understood the impression he had made; and\\r\\nthough he seemed more or less confused at first, yet he began talking\\r\\nwith what looked like assumed ease and freedom. However, the prince\\r\\nsoon changed his mind on this score, and thought that there was not\\r\\nonly no affectation of indifference, but that Rogojin was not even\\r\\nparticularly agitated. If there were a little apparent awkwardness, it\\r\\nwas only in his words and gestures. The man could not change his heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow did youâ\\x80\\x94find me here?â\\x80\\x9d asked the prince for the sake of saying\\r\\nsomething.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cKeller told me (I found him at your place) that you were in the park.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Of course he is!â\\x80\\x99 I thought.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy so?â\\x80\\x9d asked the prince uneasily.\\r\\n\\r\\nRogojin smiled, but did not explain.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI received your letter, Lef Nicolaievitchâ\\x80\\x94whatâ\\x80\\x99s the good of all\\r\\nthat?â\\x80\\x94Itâ\\x80\\x99s no use, you know. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve come to you from _her_,â\\x80\\x94she bade me\\r\\ntell you that she must see you, she has something to say to you. She\\r\\ntold me to find you today.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll come tomorrow. Now Iâ\\x80\\x99m going homeâ\\x80\\x94are you coming to my house?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy should I? Iâ\\x80\\x99ve given you the message.â\\x80\\x94Goodbye!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWonâ\\x80\\x99t you come?â\\x80\\x9d asked the prince in a gentle voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat an extraordinary man you are! I wonder at you!â\\x80\\x9d Rogojin laughed\\r\\nsarcastically.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy do you hate me so?â\\x80\\x9d asked the prince, sadly. â\\x80\\x9cYou know yourself\\r\\nthat all you suspected is quite unfounded. I felt you were still angry\\r\\nwith me, though. Do you know why? Because you tried to kill meâ\\x80\\x94thatâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nwhy you canâ\\x80\\x99t shake off your wrath against me. I tell you that I only\\r\\nremember the Parfen Rogojin with whom I exchanged crosses, and vowed\\r\\nbrotherhood. I wrote you this in yesterdayâ\\x80\\x99s letter, in order that you\\r\\nmight forget all that madness on your part, and that you might not feel\\r\\ncalled to talk about it when we met. Why do you avoid me? Why do you\\r\\nhold your hand back from me? I tell you again, I consider all that has\\r\\npassed a delirium, an insane dream. I can understand all you did, and\\r\\nall you felt that day, as if it were myself. What you were then\\r\\nimagining was not the case, and could never be the case. Why, then,\\r\\nshould there be anger between us?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou donâ\\x80\\x99t know what anger is!â\\x80\\x9d laughed Rogojin, in reply to the\\r\\nprinceâ\\x80\\x99s heated words.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had moved a pace or two away, and was hiding his hands behind him.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, it is impossible for me to come to your house again,â\\x80\\x9d he added\\r\\nslowly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy? Do you hate me so much as all that?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t love you, Lef Nicolaievitch, and, therefore, what would be the\\r\\nuse of my coming to see you? You are just like a childâ\\x80\\x94you want a\\r\\nplaything, and it must be taken out and given youâ\\x80\\x94and then you donâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nknow how to work it. You are simply repeating all you said in your\\r\\nletter, and whatâ\\x80\\x99s the use? Of course I believe every word you say, and\\r\\nI know perfectly well that you neither did or ever can deceive me in\\r\\nany way, and yet, I donâ\\x80\\x99t love you. You write that youâ\\x80\\x99ve forgotten\\r\\neverything, and only remember your brother Parfen, with whom you\\r\\nexchanged crosses, and that you donâ\\x80\\x99t remember anything about the\\r\\nRogojin who aimed a knife at your throat. What do you know about my\\r\\nfeelings, eh?â\\x80\\x9d (Rogojin laughed disagreeably.) â\\x80\\x9cHere you are holding\\r\\nout your brotherly forgiveness to me for a thing that I have perhaps\\r\\nnever repented of in the slightest degree. I did not think of it again\\r\\nall that evening; all my thoughts were centred on something elseâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot think of it again? Of course you didnâ\\x80\\x99t!â\\x80\\x9d cried the prince. â\\x80\\x9cAnd I\\r\\ndare swear that you came straight away down here to Pavlofsk to listen\\r\\nto the music and dog her about in the crowd, and stare at her, just as\\r\\nyou did today. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing surprising in that! If you hadnâ\\x80\\x99t been\\r\\nin that condition of mind that you could think of nothing but one\\r\\nsubject, you would, probably, never have raised your knife against me.\\r\\nI had a presentiment of what you would do, that day, ever since I saw\\r\\nyou first in the morning. Do you know yourself what you looked like? I\\r\\nknew you would try to murder me even at the very moment when we\\r\\nexchanged crosses. What did you take me to your mother for? Did you\\r\\nthink to stay your hand by doing so? Perhaps you did not put your\\r\\nthoughts into words, but you and I were thinking the same thing, or\\r\\nfeeling the same thing looming over us, at the same moment. What should\\r\\nyou think of me now if you had not raised your knife to meâ\\x80\\x94the knife\\r\\nwhich God averted from my throat? I would have been guilty of\\r\\nsuspecting you all the sameâ\\x80\\x94and you would have intended the murder all\\r\\nthe same; therefore we should have been mutually guilty in any case.\\r\\nCome, donâ\\x80\\x99t frown; you neednâ\\x80\\x99t laugh at me, either. You say you havenâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98repented.â\\x80\\x99 Repented! You probably couldnâ\\x80\\x99t, if you were to try; you\\r\\ndislike me too much for that. Why, if I were an angel of light, and as\\r\\ninnocent before you as a babe, you would still loathe me if you\\r\\nbelieved that _she_ loved me, instead of loving yourself. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\njealousyâ\\x80\\x94that is the real jealousy.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut do you know what I have been thinking out during this last week,\\r\\nParfen? Iâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you. What if she loves you now better than anyone?\\r\\nAnd what if she torments you _because_ she loves you, and in proportion\\r\\nto her love for you, so she torments you the more? She wonâ\\x80\\x99t tell you\\r\\nthis, of course; you must have eyes to see. Why do you suppose she\\r\\nconsents to marry you? She must have a reason, and that reason she will\\r\\ntell you some day. Some women desire the kind of love you give her, and\\r\\nshe is probably one of these. Your love and your wild nature impress\\r\\nher. Do you know that a woman is capable of driving a man crazy almost,\\r\\nwith her cruelties and mockeries, and feels not one single pang of\\r\\nregret, because she looks at him and says to herself, â\\x80\\x98There! Iâ\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\ntorment this man nearly into his grave, and then, oh! how Iâ\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\ncompensate him for it all with my love!â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRogojin listened to the end, and then burst out laughing:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, prince, I declare you must have had a taste of this sort of thing\\r\\nyourselfâ\\x80\\x94havenâ\\x80\\x99t you? I have heard tell of something of the kind, you\\r\\nknow; is it true?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat? What can you have heard?â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, stammering.\\r\\n\\r\\nRogojin continued to laugh loudly. He had listened to the princeâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nspeech with curiosity and some satisfaction. The speakerâ\\x80\\x99s impulsive\\r\\nwarmth had surprised and even comforted him.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve not only heard of it; I see it for myself,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cWhen\\r\\nhave you ever spoken like that before? It wasnâ\\x80\\x99t like yourself, prince.\\r\\nWhy, if I hadnâ\\x80\\x99t heard this report about you, I should never have come\\r\\nall this way into the parkâ\\x80\\x94at midnight, too!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t understand you in the least, Parfen.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, _she_ told me all about it long ago, and tonight I saw for myself.\\r\\nI saw you at the music, you know, and whom you were sitting with. She\\r\\nswore to me yesterday, and again today, that you are madly in love with\\r\\nAglaya Ivanovna. But thatâ\\x80\\x99s all the same to me, prince, and itâ\\x80\\x99s not my\\r\\naffair at all; for if you have ceased to love _her_, _she_ has not\\r\\nceased to love _you_. You know, of course, that she wants to marry you\\r\\nto that girl? Sheâ\\x80\\x99s sworn to it! Ha, ha! She says to me, â\\x80\\x98Until then I\\r\\nwonâ\\x80\\x99t marry you. When they go to church, weâ\\x80\\x99ll go tooâ\\x80\\x94and not before.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nWhat on earth does she mean by it? I donâ\\x80\\x99t know, and I never did.\\r\\nEither she loves you without limits orâ\\x80\\x94yet, if she loves you, why does\\r\\nshe wish to marry you to another girl? She says, â\\x80\\x98I want to see him\\r\\nhappy,â\\x80\\x99 which is to sayâ\\x80\\x94she loves you.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI wrote, and I say to you once more, that she is not in her right\\r\\nmind,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, who had listened with anguish to what Rogojin\\r\\nsaid.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGoodness knowsâ\\x80\\x94you may be wrong there! At all events, she named the\\r\\nday this evening, as we left the gardens. â\\x80\\x98In three weeks,â\\x80\\x99 says she,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98and perhaps sooner, we shall be married.â\\x80\\x99 She swore to it, took off\\r\\nher cross and kissed it. So it all depends upon you now, prince, You\\r\\nsee! Ha, ha!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s all madness. What you say about me, Parfen, never can and never\\r\\nwill be. Tomorrow, I shall come and see youâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow can she be mad,â\\x80\\x9d Rogojin interrupted, â\\x80\\x9cwhen she is sane enough for\\r\\nother people and only mad for you? How can she write letters to _her_,\\r\\nif sheâ\\x80\\x99s mad? If she were insane they would observe it in her letters.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat letters?â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, alarmed.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe writes to _her_â\\x80\\x94and the girl reads the letters. Havenâ\\x80\\x99t you\\r\\nheard?â\\x80\\x94You are sure to hear; sheâ\\x80\\x99s sure to show you the letters\\r\\nherself.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI wonâ\\x80\\x99t believe this!â\\x80\\x9d cried the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, prince, youâ\\x80\\x99ve only gone a few steps along this road, I perceive.\\r\\nYou are evidently a mere beginner. Wait a bit! Before long, youâ\\x80\\x99ll have\\r\\nyour own detectives, youâ\\x80\\x99ll watch day and night, and youâ\\x80\\x99ll know every\\r\\nlittle thing that goes on thereâ\\x80\\x94that is, ifâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDrop that subject, Rogojin, and never mention it again. And listen: as\\r\\nI have sat here, and talked, and listened, it has suddenly struck me\\r\\nthat tomorrow is my birthday. It must be about twelve oâ\\x80\\x99clock, now;\\r\\ncome home with meâ\\x80\\x94do, and weâ\\x80\\x99ll see the day in! Weâ\\x80\\x99ll have some wine,\\r\\nand you shall wish meâ\\x80\\x94I donâ\\x80\\x99t know whatâ\\x80\\x94but you, especially you, must\\r\\nwish me a good wish, and I shall wish you full happiness in return.\\r\\nOtherwise, hand me my cross back again. You didnâ\\x80\\x99t return it to me next\\r\\nday. Havenâ\\x80\\x99t you got it on now?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I have,â\\x80\\x9d said Rogojin.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome along, then. I donâ\\x80\\x99t wish to meet my new year without youâ\\x80\\x94my new\\r\\nlife, I should say, for a new life is beginning for me. Did you know,\\r\\nParfen, that a new life had begun for me?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI see for myself that it is soâ\\x80\\x94and I shall tell _her_. But you are not\\r\\nquite yourself, Lef Nicolaievitch.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIV.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince observed with great surprise, as he approached his villa,\\r\\naccompanied by Rogojin, that a large number of people were assembled on\\r\\nhis verandah, which was brilliantly lighted up. The company seemed\\r\\nmerry and were noisily laughing and talkingâ\\x80\\x94even quarrelling, to judge\\r\\nfrom the sounds. At all events they were clearly enjoying themselves,\\r\\nand the prince observed further on closer investigationâ\\x80\\x94that all had\\r\\nbeen drinking champagne. To judge from the lively condition of some of\\r\\nthe party, it was to be supposed that a considerable quantity of\\r\\nchampagne had been consumed already.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the guests were known to the prince; but the curious part of the\\r\\nmatter was that they had all arrived on the same evening, as though\\r\\nwith one accord, although he had only himself recollected the fact that\\r\\nit was his birthday a few moments since.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou must have told somebody you were going to trot out the champagne,\\r\\nand thatâ\\x80\\x99s why they are all come!â\\x80\\x9d muttered Rogojin, as the two entered\\r\\nthe verandah. â\\x80\\x9cWe know all about that! Youâ\\x80\\x99ve only to whistle and they\\r\\ncome up in shoals!â\\x80\\x9d he continued, almost angrily. He was doubtless\\r\\nthinking of his own late experiences with his boon companions.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll surrounded the prince with exclamations of welcome, and, on hearing\\r\\nthat it was his birthday, with cries of congratulation and delight;\\r\\nmany of them were very noisy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe presence of certain of those in the room surprised the prince\\r\\nvastly, but the guest whose advent filled him with the greatest\\r\\nwonderâ\\x80\\x94almost amounting to alarmâ\\x80\\x94was Evgenie Pavlovitch. The prince\\r\\ncould not believe his eyes when he beheld the latter, and could not\\r\\nhelp thinking that something was wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nLebedeff ran up promptly to explain the arrival of all these gentlemen.\\r\\nHe was himself somewhat intoxicated, but the prince gathered from his\\r\\nlong-winded periods that the party had assembled quite naturally, and\\r\\naccidentally.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst of all Hippolyte had arrived, early in the evening, and feeling\\r\\ndecidedly better, had determined to await the prince on the verandah.\\r\\nThere Lebedeff had joined him, and his household had followedâ\\x80\\x94that is,\\r\\nhis daughters and General Ivolgin. Burdovsky had brought Hippolyte, and\\r\\nstayed on with him. Gania and Ptitsin had dropped in accidentally later\\r\\non; then came Keller, and he and Colia insisted on having champagne.\\r\\nEvgenie Pavlovitch had only dropped in half an hour or so ago. Lebedeff\\r\\nhad served the champagne readily.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy own though, prince, my own, mind,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cand thereâ\\x80\\x99ll be some\\r\\nsupper later on; my daughter is getting it ready now. Come and sit\\r\\ndown, prince, we are all waiting for you, we want you with us. Fancy\\r\\nwhat we have been discussing! You know the question, â\\x80\\x98to be or not to\\r\\nbe,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x94out of Hamlet! A contemporary theme! Quite up-to-date! Mr.\\r\\nHippolyte has been eloquent to a degree. He wonâ\\x80\\x99t go to bed, but he has\\r\\nonly drunk a little champagne, and that canâ\\x80\\x99t do him any harm. Come\\r\\nalong, prince, and settle the question. Everyone is waiting for you,\\r\\nsighing for the light of your luminous intelligence...â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince noticed the sweet, welcoming look on Vera Lebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s face,\\r\\nas she made her way towards him through the crowd. He held out his hand\\r\\nto her. She took it, blushing with delight, and wished him â\\x80\\x9ca happy\\r\\nlife from that day forward.â\\x80\\x9d Then she ran off to the kitchen, where her\\r\\npresence was necessary to help in the preparations for supper. Before\\r\\nthe princeâ\\x80\\x99s arrival she had spent some time on the terrace, listening\\r\\neagerly to the conversation, though the visitors, mostly under the\\r\\ninfluence of wine, were discussing abstract subjects far beyond her\\r\\ncomprehension. In the next room her younger sister lay on a wooden\\r\\nchest, sound asleep, with her mouth wide open; but the boy, Lebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nson, had taken up his position close beside Colia and Hippolyte, his\\r\\nface lit up with interest in the conversation of his father and the\\r\\nrest, to which he would willingly have listened for ten hours at a\\r\\nstretch.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have waited for you on purpose, and am very glad to see you arrive\\r\\nso happy,â\\x80\\x9d said Hippolyte, when the prince came forward to press his\\r\\nhand, immediately after greeting Vera.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd how do you know that I am â\\x80\\x98so happyâ\\x80\\x99?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI can see it by your face! Say â\\x80\\x98how do you doâ\\x80\\x99 to the others, and come\\r\\nand sit down here, quickâ\\x80\\x94Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been waiting for you!â\\x80\\x9d he added,\\r\\naccentuating the fact that he had waited. On the princeâ\\x80\\x99s asking, â\\x80\\x9cWill\\r\\nit not be injurious to you to sit out so late?â\\x80\\x9d he replied that he\\r\\ncould not believe that he had thought himself dying three days or so\\r\\nago, for he never had felt better than this evening.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurdovsky next jumped up and explained that he had come in by accident,\\r\\nhaving escorted Hippolyte from town. He murmured that he was glad he\\r\\nhad â\\x80\\x9cwritten nonsenseâ\\x80\\x9d in his letter, and then pressed the princeâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nhand warmly and sat down again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince approached Evgenie Pavlovitch last of all. The latter\\r\\nimmediately took his arm.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have a couple of words to say to you,â\\x80\\x9d he began, â\\x80\\x9cand those on a\\r\\nvery important matter; letâ\\x80\\x99s go aside for a minute or two.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cJust a couple of words!â\\x80\\x9d whispered another voice in the princeâ\\x80\\x99s other\\r\\near, and another hand took his other arm. Muishkin turned, and to his\\r\\ngreat surprise observed a red, flushed face and a droll-looking figure\\r\\nwhich he recognized at once as that of Ferdishenko. Goodness knows\\r\\nwhere he had turned up from!\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you remember Ferdishenko?â\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhere have you dropped from?â\\x80\\x9d cried the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe is sorry for his sins now, prince,â\\x80\\x9d cried Keller. â\\x80\\x9cHe did not want\\r\\nto let you know he was here; he was hidden over there in the\\r\\ncorner,â\\x80\\x94but he repents now, he feels his guilt.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, what has he done?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI met him outside and brought him inâ\\x80\\x94heâ\\x80\\x99s a gentleman who doesnâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\noften allow his friends to see him, of lateâ\\x80\\x94but heâ\\x80\\x99s sorry now.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDelighted, Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure!â\\x80\\x94Iâ\\x80\\x99ll come back directly, gentlemen,â\\x80\\x94sit down\\r\\nthere with the others, please,â\\x80\\x94excuse me one moment,â\\x80\\x9d said the host,\\r\\ngetting away with difficulty in order to follow Evgenie.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are very gay here,â\\x80\\x9d began the latter, â\\x80\\x9cand I have had quite a\\r\\npleasant half-hour while I waited for you. Now then, my dear Lef\\r\\nNicolaievitch, this is whatâ\\x80\\x99s the matter. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve arranged it all with\\r\\nMoloftsoff, and have just come in to relieve your mind on that score.\\r\\nYou need be under no apprehensions. He was very sensible, as he should\\r\\nbe, of course, for I think he was entirely to blame himself.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat Moloftsoff?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe young fellow whose arms you held, donâ\\x80\\x99t you know? He was so wild\\r\\nwith you that he was going to send a friend to you tomorrow morning.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat nonsense!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course it is nonsense, and in nonsense it would have ended,\\r\\ndoubtless; but you know these fellows, theyâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExcuse me, but I think you must have something else that you wished to\\r\\nspeak about, Evgenie Pavlovitch?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course, I have!â\\x80\\x9d said the other, laughing. â\\x80\\x9cYou see, my dear\\r\\nfellow, tomorrow, very early in the morning, I must be off to town\\r\\nabout this unfortunate business (my uncle, you know!). Just imagine, my\\r\\ndear sir, it is all trueâ\\x80\\x94word for wordâ\\x80\\x94and, of course, everybody knew\\r\\nit excepting myself. All this has been such a blow to me that I have\\r\\nnot managed to call in at the Epanchinsâ\\x80\\x99. Tomorrow I shall not see them\\r\\neither, because I shall be in town. I may not be here for three days or\\r\\nmore; in a word, my affairs are a little out of gear. But though my\\r\\ntown business is, of course, most pressing, still I determined not to\\r\\ngo away until I had seen you, and had a clear understanding with you\\r\\nupon certain points; and that without loss of time. I will wait now, if\\r\\nyou will allow me, until the company departs; I may just as well, for I\\r\\nhave nowhere else to go to, and I shall certainly not do any sleeping\\r\\ntonight; Iâ\\x80\\x99m far too excited. And finally, I must confess that, though\\r\\nI know it is bad form to pursue a man in this way, I have come to beg\\r\\nyour friendship, my dear prince. You are an unusual sort of a person;\\r\\nyou donâ\\x80\\x99t lie at every step, as some men do; in fact, you donâ\\x80\\x99t lie at\\r\\nall, and there is a matter in which I need a true and sincere friend,\\r\\nfor I really may claim to be among the number of bona fide unfortunates\\r\\njust now.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe laughed again.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut the trouble is,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, after a slight pause for\\r\\nreflection, â\\x80\\x9cthat goodness only knows when this party will break up.\\r\\nHadnâ\\x80\\x99t we better stroll into the park? Iâ\\x80\\x99ll excuse myself, thereâ\\x80\\x99s no\\r\\ndanger of their going away.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, no! I have my reasons for wishing them not to suspect us of being\\r\\nengaged in any specially important conversation. There are gentry\\r\\npresent who are a little too much interested in us. You are not aware\\r\\nof that perhaps, prince? It will be a great deal better if they see\\r\\nthat we are friendly just in an ordinary way. Theyâ\\x80\\x99ll all go in a\\r\\ncouple of hours, and then Iâ\\x80\\x99ll ask you to give me twenty minutesâ\\x80\\x94half\\r\\nan hour at most.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBy all means! I assure you I am delightedâ\\x80\\x94you need not have entered\\r\\ninto all these explanations. As for your remarks about friendship with\\r\\nmeâ\\x80\\x94thanks, very much indeed. You must excuse my being a little absent\\r\\nthis evening. Do you know, I cannot somehow be attentive to anything\\r\\njust now?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI see, I see,â\\x80\\x9d said Evgenie, smiling gently. His mirth seemed very\\r\\nnear the surface this evening.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat do you see?â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, startled.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t want you to suspect that I have simply come here to deceive\\r\\nyou and pump information out of you!â\\x80\\x9d said Evgenie, still smiling, and\\r\\nwithout making any direct reply to the question.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, but I havenâ\\x80\\x99t the slightest doubt that you did come to pump me,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nsaid the prince, laughing himself, at last; â\\x80\\x9cand I dare say you are\\r\\nquite prepared to deceive me too, so far as that goes. But what of\\r\\nthat? Iâ\\x80\\x99m not afraid of you; besides, youâ\\x80\\x99ll hardly believe it, I feel\\r\\nas though I really didnâ\\x80\\x99t care a scrap one way or the other, just\\r\\nnow!â\\x80\\x94Andâ\\x80\\x94andâ\\x80\\x94and as you are a capital fellow, I am convinced of that, I\\r\\ndare say we really shall end by being good friends. I like you very\\r\\nmuch Evgenie Pavlovitch; I consider you a very good fellow indeed.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, in any case, you are a most delightful man to have to deal with,\\r\\nbe the business what it may,â\\x80\\x9d concluded Evgenie. â\\x80\\x9cCome along now, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\ndrink a glass to your health. Iâ\\x80\\x99m charmed to have entered into alliance\\r\\nwith you. By-the-by,â\\x80\\x9d he added suddenly, â\\x80\\x9chas this young Hippolyte come\\r\\ndown to stay with you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s not going to die at once, I should think, is he?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, I donâ\\x80\\x99t know. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been half an hour here with him, and heâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHippolyte had been waiting for the prince all this time, and had never\\r\\nceased looking at him and Evgenie Pavlovitch as they conversed in the\\r\\ncorner. He became much excited when they approached the table once\\r\\nmore. He was disturbed in his mind, it seemed; perspiration stood in\\r\\nlarge drops on his forehead; in his gleaming eyes it was easy to read\\r\\nimpatience and agitation; his gaze wandered from face to face of those\\r\\npresent, and from object to object in the room, apparently without aim.\\r\\nHe had taken a part, and an animated one, in the noisy conversation of\\r\\nthe company; but his animation was clearly the outcome of fever. His\\r\\ntalk was almost incoherent; he would break off in the middle of a\\r\\nsentence which he had begun with great interest, and forget what he had\\r\\nbeen saying. The prince discovered to his dismay that Hippolyte had\\r\\nbeen allowed to drink two large glasses of champagne; the one now\\r\\nstanding by him being the third. All this he found out afterwards; at\\r\\nthe moment he did not notice anything, very particularly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you know I am specially glad that today is your birthday!â\\x80\\x9d cried\\r\\nHippolyte.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ll soon see. Dâ\\x80\\x99you know I had a feeling that there would be a lot\\r\\nof people here tonight? Itâ\\x80\\x99s not the first time that my presentiments\\r\\nhave been fulfilled. I wish I had known it was your birthday, Iâ\\x80\\x99d have\\r\\nbrought you a presentâ\\x80\\x94perhaps I have got a present for you! Who knows?\\r\\nHa, ha! How long is it now before daylight?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot a couple of hours,â\\x80\\x9d said Ptitsin, looking at his watch. â\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nthe good of daylight now? One can read all night in the open air\\r\\nwithout it,â\\x80\\x9d said someone.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe good of it! Well, I want just to see a ray of the sun,â\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nHippolyte. â\\x80\\x9cCan one drink to the sunâ\\x80\\x99s health, do you think, prince?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, I dare say one can; but you had better be calm and lie down,\\r\\nHippolyteâ\\x80\\x94thatâ\\x80\\x99s much more important.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are always preaching about resting; you are a regular nurse to me,\\r\\nprince. As soon as the sun begins to â\\x80\\x98resoundâ\\x80\\x99 in the skyâ\\x80\\x94what poet\\r\\nsaid that? â\\x80\\x98The sun resounded in the sky.â\\x80\\x99 It is beautiful, though\\r\\nthereâ\\x80\\x99s no sense in it!â\\x80\\x94then we will go to bed. Lebedeff, tell me, is\\r\\nthe sun the source of life? What does the source, or â\\x80\\x98spring,â\\x80\\x99 of life\\r\\nreally mean in the Apocalypse? You have heard of the â\\x80\\x98Star that is\\r\\ncalled Wormwood,â\\x80\\x99 prince?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have heard that Lebedeff explains it as the railroads that cover\\r\\nEurope like a net.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEverybody laughed, and Lebedeff got up abruptly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo! Allow me, that is not what we are discussing!â\\x80\\x9d he cried, waving\\r\\nhis hand to impose silence. â\\x80\\x9cAllow me! With these gentlemen... all\\r\\nthese gentlemen,â\\x80\\x9d he added, suddenly addressing the prince, â\\x80\\x9con certain\\r\\npoints... that is...â\\x80\\x9d He thumped the table repeatedly, and the laughter\\r\\nincreased. Lebedeff was in his usual evening condition, and had just\\r\\nended a long and scientific argument, which had left him excited and\\r\\nirritable. On such occasions he was apt to evince a supreme contempt\\r\\nfor his opponents.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is not right! Half an hour ago, prince, it was agreed among us that\\r\\nno one should interrupt, no one should laugh, that each person was to\\r\\nexpress his thoughts freely; and then at the end, when everyone had\\r\\nspoken, objections might be made, even by the atheists. We chose the\\r\\ngeneral as president. Now without some such rule and order, anyone\\r\\nmight be shouted down, even in the loftiest and most profound\\r\\nthought....â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGo on! Go on! Nobody is going to interrupt you!â\\x80\\x9d cried several voices.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSpeak, but keep to the point!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat is this â\\x80\\x98starâ\\x80\\x99?â\\x80\\x9d asked another.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have no idea,â\\x80\\x9d replied General Ivolgin, who presided with much\\r\\ngravity.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI love these arguments, prince,â\\x80\\x9d said Keller, also more than half\\r\\nintoxicated, moving restlessly in his chair. â\\x80\\x9cScientific and\\r\\npolitical.â\\x80\\x9d Then, turning suddenly towards Evgenie Pavlovitch, who was\\r\\nseated near him: â\\x80\\x9cDo you know, I simply adore reading the accounts of\\r\\nthe debates in the English parliament. Not that the discussions\\r\\nthemselves interest me; I am not a politician, you know; but it\\r\\ndelights me to see how they address each other â\\x80\\x98the noble lord who\\r\\nagrees with me,â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98my honourable opponent who astonished Europe with his\\r\\nproposal,â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98the noble viscount sitting oppositeâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x94all these expressions,\\r\\nall this parliamentarism of a free people, has an enormous attraction\\r\\nfor me. It fascinates me, prince. I have always been an artist in the\\r\\ndepths of my soul, I assure you, Evgenie Pavlovitch.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you mean to say,â\\x80\\x9d cried Gania, from the other corner, â\\x80\\x9cdo you mean\\r\\nto say that railways are accursed inventions, that they are a source of\\r\\nruin to humanity, a poison poured upon the earth to corrupt the springs\\r\\nof life?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nGavrila Ardalionovitch was in high spirits that evening, and it seemed\\r\\nto the prince that his gaiety was mingled with triumph. Of course he\\r\\nwas only joking with Lebedeff, meaning to egg him on, but he grew\\r\\nexcited himself at the same time.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot the railways, oh dear, no!â\\x80\\x9d replied Lebedeff, with a mixture of\\r\\nviolent anger and extreme enjoyment. â\\x80\\x9cConsidered alone, the railways\\r\\nwill not pollute the springs of life, but as a whole they are accursed.\\r\\nThe whole tendency of our latest centuries, in its scientific and\\r\\nmaterialistic aspect, is most probably accursed.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs it certainly accursed?... or do you only mean it might be? That is\\r\\nan important point,â\\x80\\x9d said Evgenie Pavlovitch.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is accursed, certainly accursed!â\\x80\\x9d replied the clerk, vehemently.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t go so fast, Lebedeff; you are much milder in the morning,â\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nPtitsin, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut, on the other hand, more frank in the evening! In the evening\\r\\nsincere and frank,â\\x80\\x9d repeated Lebedeff, earnestly. â\\x80\\x9cMore candid, more\\r\\nexact, more honest, more honourable, and... although I may show you my\\r\\nweak side, I challenge you all; you atheists, for instance! How are you\\r\\ngoing to save the world? How find a straight road of progress, you men\\r\\nof science, of industry, of cooperation, of trades unions, and all the\\r\\nrest? How are you going to save it, I say? By what? By credit? What is\\r\\ncredit? To what will credit lead you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are too inquisitive,â\\x80\\x9d remarked Evgenie Pavlovitch.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, anyone who does not interest himself in questions such as this\\r\\nis, in my opinion, a mere fashionable dummy.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut it will lead at least to solidarity, and balance of interests,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nsaid Ptitsin.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou will reach that with nothing to help you but credit? Without\\r\\nrecourse to any moral principle, having for your foundation only\\r\\nindividual selfishness, and the satisfaction of material desires?\\r\\nUniversal peace, and the happiness of mankind as a whole, being the\\r\\nresult! Is it really so that I may understand you, sir?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut the universal necessity of living, of drinking, of eatingâ\\x80\\x94in\\r\\nshort, the whole scientific conviction that this necessity can only be\\r\\nsatisfied by universal co-operation and the solidarity of interestsâ\\x80\\x94is,\\r\\nit seems to me, a strong enough idea to serve as a basis, so to speak,\\r\\nand a â\\x80\\x98spring of life,â\\x80\\x99 for humanity in future centuries,â\\x80\\x9d said Gavrila\\r\\nArdalionovitch, now thoroughly roused.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe necessity of eating and drinking, that is to say, solely the\\r\\ninstinct of self-preservation...â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs not that enough? The instinct of self-preservation is the normal\\r\\nlaw of humanity...â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWho told you that?â\\x80\\x9d broke in Evgenie Pavlovitch.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is a law, doubtless, but a law neither more nor less normal than\\r\\nthat of destruction, even self-destruction. Is it possible that the\\r\\nwhole normal law of humanity is contained in this sentiment of\\r\\nself-preservation?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh!â\\x80\\x9d cried Hippolyte, turning towards Evgenie Pavlovitch, and looking\\r\\nat him with a queer sort of curiosity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen seeing that Radomski was laughing, he began to laugh himself,\\r\\nnudged Colia, who was sitting beside him, with his elbow, and again\\r\\nasked what time it was. He even pulled Coliaâ\\x80\\x99s silver watch out of his\\r\\nhand, and looked at it eagerly. Then, as if he had forgotten\\r\\neverything, he stretched himself out on the sofa, put his hands behind\\r\\nhis head, and looked up at the sky. After a minute or two he got up and\\r\\ncame back to the table to listen to Lebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s outpourings, as the\\r\\nlatter passionately commentated on Evgenie Pavlovitchâ\\x80\\x99s paradox.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is an artful and traitorous idea. A smart notion,â\\x80\\x9d vociferated\\r\\nthe clerk, â\\x80\\x9cthrown out as an apple of discord. But it is just. You are\\r\\na scoffer, a man of the world, a cavalry officer, and, though not\\r\\nwithout brains, you do not realize how profound is your thought, nor\\r\\nhow true. Yes, the laws of self-preservation and of self-destruction\\r\\nare equally powerful in this world. The devil will hold his empire over\\r\\nhumanity until a limit of time which is still unknown. You laugh? You\\r\\ndo not believe in the devil? Scepticism as to the devil is a French\\r\\nidea, and it is also a frivolous idea. Do you know who the devil is? Do\\r\\nyou know his name? Although you donâ\\x80\\x99t know his name you make a mockery\\r\\nof his form, following the example of Voltaire. You sneer at his hoofs,\\r\\nat his tail, at his hornsâ\\x80\\x94all of them the produce of your imagination!\\r\\nIn reality the devil is a great and terrible spirit, with neither\\r\\nhoofs, nor tail, nor horns; it is you who have endowed him with these\\r\\nattributes! But... he is not the question just now!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow do you know he is not the question now?â\\x80\\x9d cried Hippolyte, laughing\\r\\nhysterically.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnother excellent idea, and worth considering!â\\x80\\x9d replied Lebedeff.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut, again, that is not the question. The question at this moment is\\r\\nwhether we have not weakened â\\x80\\x98the springs of lifeâ\\x80\\x99 by the extension...â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf railways?â\\x80\\x9d put in Colia eagerly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot railways, properly speaking, presumptuous youth, but the general\\r\\ntendency of which railways may be considered as the outward expression\\r\\nand symbol. We hurry and push and hustle, for the good of humanity!\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98The world is becoming too noisy, too commercial!â\\x80\\x99 groans some solitary\\r\\nthinker. â\\x80\\x98Undoubtedly it is, but the noise of waggons bearing bread to\\r\\nstarving humanity is of more value than tranquillity of soul,â\\x80\\x99 replies\\r\\nanother triumphantly, and passes on with an air of pride. As for me, I\\r\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t believe in these waggons bringing bread to humanity. For, founded\\r\\non no moral principle, these may well, even in the act of carrying\\r\\nbread to humanity, coldly exclude a considerable portion of humanity\\r\\nfrom enjoying it; that has been seen more than once.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat, these waggons may coldly exclude?â\\x80\\x9d repeated someone.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat has been seen already,â\\x80\\x9d continued Lebedeff, not deigning to\\r\\nnotice the interruption. â\\x80\\x9cMalthus was a friend of humanity, but, with\\r\\nill-founded moral principles, the friend of humanity is the devourer of\\r\\nhumanity, without mentioning his pride; for, touch the vanity of one of\\r\\nthese numberless philanthropists, and to avenge his self-esteem, he\\r\\nwill be ready at once to set fire to the whole globe; and to tell the\\r\\ntruth, we are all more or less like that. I, perhaps, might be the\\r\\nfirst to set a light to the fuel, and then run away. But, again, I must\\r\\nrepeat, that is not the question.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat is it then, for goodnessâ\\x80\\x99 sake?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe is boring us!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe question is connected with the following anecdote of past times;\\r\\nfor I am obliged to relate a story. In our times, and in our country,\\r\\nwhich I hope you love as much as I do, for as far as I am concerned, I\\r\\nam ready to shed the last drop of my blood...\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGo on! Go on!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn our dear country, as indeed in the whole of Europe, a famine visits\\r\\nhumanity about four times a century, as far as I can remember; once in\\r\\nevery twenty-five years. I wonâ\\x80\\x99t swear to this being the exact figure,\\r\\nbut anyhow they have become comparatively rare.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cComparatively to what?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTo the twelfth century, and those immediately preceding and following\\r\\nit. We are told by historians that widespread famines occurred in those\\r\\ndays every two or three years, and such was the condition of things\\r\\nthat men actually had recourse to cannibalism, in secret, of course.\\r\\nOne of these cannibals, who had reached a good age, declared of his own\\r\\nfree will that during the course of his long and miserable life he had\\r\\npersonally killed and eaten, in the most profound secrecy, sixty monks,\\r\\nnot to mention several children; the number of the latter he thought\\r\\nwas about six, an insignificant total when compared with the enormous\\r\\nmass of ecclesiastics consumed by him. As to adults, laymen that is to\\r\\nsay, he had never touched them.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe president joined in the general outcry.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s impossible!â\\x80\\x9d said he in an aggrieved tone. â\\x80\\x9cI am often\\r\\ndiscussing subjects of this nature with him, gentlemen, but for the\\r\\nmost part he talks nonsense enough to make one deaf: this story has no\\r\\npretence of being true.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGeneral, remember the siege of Kars! And you, gentlemen, I assure you\\r\\nmy anecdote is the naked truth. I may remark that reality, although it\\r\\nis governed by invariable law, has at times a resemblance to falsehood.\\r\\nIn fact, the truer a thing is the less true it sounds.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut could anyone possibly eat sixty monks?â\\x80\\x9d objected the scoffing\\r\\nlisteners.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is quite clear that he did not eat them all at once, but in a space\\r\\nof fifteen or twenty years: from that point of view the thing is\\r\\ncomprehensible and natural...â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNatural?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd natural,â\\x80\\x9d repeated Lebedeff with pedantic obstinacy. â\\x80\\x9cBesides, a\\r\\nCatholic monk is by nature excessively curious; it would be quite easy\\r\\ntherefore to entice him into a wood, or some secret place, on false\\r\\npretences, and there to deal with him as said. But I do not dispute in\\r\\nthe least that the number of persons consumed appears to denote a spice\\r\\nof greediness.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is perhaps true, gentlemen,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, quietly. He had been\\r\\nlistening in silence up to that moment without taking part in the\\r\\nconversation, but laughing heartily with the others from time to time.\\r\\nEvidently he was delighted to see that everybody was amused, that\\r\\neverybody was talking at once, and even that everybody was drinking. It\\r\\nseemed as if he were not intending to speak at all, when suddenly he\\r\\nintervened in such a serious voice that everyone looked at him with\\r\\ninterest.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is true that there were frequent famines at that time, gentlemen. I\\r\\nhave often heard of them, though I do not know much history. But it\\r\\nseems to me that it must have been so. When I was in Switzerland I used\\r\\nto look with astonishment at the many ruins of feudal castles perched\\r\\non the top of steep and rocky heights, half a mile at least above\\r\\nsea-level, so that to reach them one had to climb many miles of stony\\r\\ntracks. A castle, as you know, is, a kind of mountain of stonesâ\\x80\\x94a\\r\\ndreadful, almost an impossible, labour! Doubtless the builders were all\\r\\npoor men, vassals, and had to pay heavy taxes, and to keep up the\\r\\npriesthood. How, then, could they provide for themselves, and when had\\r\\nthey time to plough and sow their fields? The greater number must,\\r\\nliterally, have died of starvation. I have sometimes asked myself how\\r\\nit was that these communities were not utterly swept off the face of\\r\\nthe earth, and how they could possibly survive. Lebedeff is not\\r\\nmistaken, in my opinion, when he says that there were cannibals in\\r\\nthose days, perhaps in considerable numbers; but I do not understand\\r\\nwhy he should have dragged in the monks, nor what he means by that.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is undoubtedly because, in the twelfth century, monks were the only\\r\\npeople one could eat; they were the fat, among many lean,â\\x80\\x9d said Gavrila\\r\\nArdalionovitch.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA brilliant idea, and most true!â\\x80\\x9d cried Lebedeff, â\\x80\\x9cfor he never even\\r\\ntouched the laity. Sixty monks, and not a single layman! It is a\\r\\nterrible idea, but it is historic, it is statistic; it is indeed one of\\r\\nthose facts which enables an intelligent historian to reconstruct the\\r\\nphysiognomy of a special epoch, for it brings out this further point\\r\\nwith mathematical accuracy, that the clergy were in those days sixty\\r\\ntimes richer and more flourishing than the rest of humanity and perhaps\\r\\nsixty times fatter also...â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are exaggerating, you are exaggerating, Lebedeff!â\\x80\\x9d cried his\\r\\nhearers, amid laughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI admit that it is an historic thought, but what is your conclusion?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nasked the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe spoke so seriously in addressing Lebedeff, that his tone contrasted\\r\\nquite comically with that of the others. They were very nearly laughing\\r\\nat him, too, but he did not notice it.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t you see he is a lunatic, prince?â\\x80\\x9d whispered Evgenie Pavlovitch\\r\\nin his ear. â\\x80\\x9cSomeone told me just now that he is a bit touched on the\\r\\nsubject of lawyers, that he has a mania for making speeches and intends\\r\\nto pass the examinations. I am expecting a splendid burlesque now.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy conclusion is vast,â\\x80\\x9d replied Lebedeff, in a voice like thunder.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLet us examine first the psychological and legal position of the\\r\\ncriminal. We see that in spite of the difficulty of finding other food,\\r\\nthe accused, or, as we may say, my client, has often during his\\r\\npeculiar life exhibited signs of repentance, and of wishing to give up\\r\\nthis clerical diet. Incontrovertible facts prove this assertion. He has\\r\\neaten five or six children, a relatively insignificant number, no\\r\\ndoubt, but remarkable enough from another point of view. It is manifest\\r\\nthat, pricked by remorseâ\\x80\\x94for my client is religious, in his way, and\\r\\nhas a conscience, as I shall prove laterâ\\x80\\x94and desiring to extenuate his\\r\\nsin as far as possible, he has tried six times at least to substitute\\r\\nlay nourishment for clerical. That this was merely an experiment we can\\r\\nhardly doubt: for if it had been only a question of gastronomic\\r\\nvariety, six would have been too few; why only six? Why not thirty? But\\r\\nif we regard it as an experiment, inspired by the fear of committing\\r\\nnew sacrilege, then this number six becomes intelligible. Six attempts\\r\\nto calm his remorse, and the pricking of his conscience, would amply\\r\\nsuffice, for these attempts could scarcely have been happy ones. In my\\r\\nhumble opinion, a child is too small; I should say, not sufficient;\\r\\nwhich would result in four or five times more lay children than monks\\r\\nbeing required in a given time. The sin, lessened on the one hand,\\r\\nwould therefore be increased on the other, in quantity, not in quality.\\r\\nPlease understand, gentlemen, that in reasoning thus, I am taking the\\r\\npoint of view which might have been taken by a criminal of the middle\\r\\nages. As for myself, a man of the late nineteenth century, I, of\\r\\ncourse, should reason differently; I say so plainly, and therefore you\\r\\nneed not jeer at me nor mock me, gentlemen. As for you, general, it is\\r\\nstill more unbecoming on your part. In the second place, and giving my\\r\\nown personal opinion, a childâ\\x80\\x99s flesh is not a satisfying diet; it is\\r\\ntoo insipid, too sweet; and the criminal, in making these experiments,\\r\\ncould have satisfied neither his conscience nor his appetite. I am\\r\\nabout to conclude, gentlemen; and my conclusion contains a reply to one\\r\\nof the most important questions of that day and of our own! This\\r\\ncriminal ended at last by denouncing himself to the clergy, and giving\\r\\nhimself up to justice. We cannot but ask, remembering the penal system\\r\\nof that day, and the tortures that awaited himâ\\x80\\x94the wheel, the stake,\\r\\nthe fire!â\\x80\\x94we cannot but ask, I repeat, what induced him to accuse\\r\\nhimself of this crime? Why did he not simply stop short at the number\\r\\nsixty, and keep his secret until his last breath? Why could he not\\r\\nsimply leave the monks alone, and go into the desert to repent? Or why\\r\\nnot become a monk himself? That is where the puzzle comes in! There\\r\\nmust have been something stronger than the stake or the fire, or even\\r\\nthan the habits of twenty years! There must have been an idea more\\r\\npowerful than all the calamities and sorrows of this world, famine or\\r\\ntorture, leprosy or plagueâ\\x80\\x94an idea which entered into the heart,\\r\\ndirected and enlarged the springs of life, and made even that hell\\r\\nsupportable to humanity! Show me a force, a power like that, in this\\r\\nour century of vices and railways! I might say, perhaps, in our century\\r\\nof steamboats and railways, but I repeat in our century of vices and\\r\\nrailways, because I am drunk but truthful! Show me a single idea which\\r\\nunites men nowadays with half the strength that it had in those\\r\\ncenturies, and dare to maintain that the â\\x80\\x98springs of lifeâ\\x80\\x99 have not\\r\\nbeen polluted and weakened beneath this â\\x80\\x98star,â\\x80\\x99 beneath this network in\\r\\nwhich men are entangled! Donâ\\x80\\x99t talk to me about your prosperity, your\\r\\nriches, the rarity of famine, the rapidity of the means of transport!\\r\\nThere is more of riches, but less of force. The idea uniting heart and\\r\\nsoul to heart and soul exists no more. All is loose, soft, limpâ\\x80\\x94we are\\r\\nall of us limp.... Enough, gentlemen! I have done. That is not the\\r\\nquestion. No, the question is now, excellency, I believe, to sit down\\r\\nto the banquet you are about to provide for us!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLebedeff had roused great indignation in some of his auditors (it\\r\\nshould be remarked that the bottles were constantly uncorked during his\\r\\nspeech); but this unexpected conclusion calmed even the most turbulent\\r\\nspirits. â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s how a clever barrister makes a good point!â\\x80\\x9d said he,\\r\\nwhen speaking of his peroration later on. The visitors began to laugh\\r\\nand chatter once again; the committee left their seats, and stretched\\r\\ntheir legs on the terrace. Keller alone was still disgusted with\\r\\nLebedeff and his speech; he turned from one to another, saying in a\\r\\nloud voice:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe attacks education, he boasts of the fanaticism of the twelfth\\r\\ncentury, he makes absurd grimaces, and added to that he is by no means\\r\\nthe innocent he makes himself out to be. How did he get the money to\\r\\nbuy this house, allow me to ask?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn another corner was the general, holding forth to a group of hearers,\\r\\namong them Ptitsin, whom he had buttonholed. â\\x80\\x9cI have known,â\\x80\\x9d said he,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9ca real interpreter of the Apocalypse, the late Gregory Semeonovitch\\r\\nBurmistroff, and heâ\\x80\\x94he pierced the heart like a fiery flash! He began\\r\\nby putting on his spectacles, then he opened a large black book; his\\r\\nwhite beard, and his two medals on his breast, recalling acts of\\r\\ncharity, all added to his impressiveness. He began in a stern voice,\\r\\nand before him generals, hard men of the world, bowed down, and ladies\\r\\nfell to the ground fainting. But this one hereâ\\x80\\x94he ends by announcing a\\r\\nbanquet! That is not the real thing!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPtitsin listened and smiled, then turned as if to get his hat; but if\\r\\nhe had intended to leave, he changed his mind. Before the others had\\r\\nrisen from the table, Gania had suddenly left off drinking, and pushed\\r\\naway his glass, a dark shadow seemed to come over his face. When they\\r\\nall rose, he went and sat down by Rogojin. It might have been believed\\r\\nthat quite friendly relations existed between them. Rogojin, who had\\r\\nalso seemed on the point of going away now sat motionless, his head\\r\\nbent, seeming to have forgotten his intention. He had drunk no wine,\\r\\nand appeared absorbed in reflection. From time to time he raised his\\r\\neyes, and examined everyone present; one might have imagined that he\\r\\nwas expecting something very important to himself, and that he had\\r\\ndecided to wait for it. The prince had taken two or three glasses of\\r\\nchampagne, and seemed cheerful. As he rose he noticed Evgenie\\r\\nPavlovitch, and, remembering the appointment he had made with him,\\r\\nsmiled pleasantly. Evgenie Pavlovitch made a sign with his head towards\\r\\nHippolyte, whom he was attentively watching. The invalid was fast\\r\\nasleep, stretched out on the sofa.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTell me, prince, why on earth did this boy intrude himself upon you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nhe asked, with such annoyance and irritation in his voice that the\\r\\nprince was quite surprised. â\\x80\\x9cI wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t mind laying odds that he is up\\r\\nto some mischief.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have observed,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, â\\x80\\x9cthat he seems to be an object of\\r\\nvery singular interest to you, Evgenie Pavlovitch. Why is it?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou may add that I have surely enough to think of, on my own account,\\r\\nwithout him; and therefore it is all the more surprising that I cannot\\r\\ntear my eyes and thoughts away from his detestable physiognomy.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, come! He has a handsome face.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, look at himâ\\x80\\x94look at him now!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince glanced again at Evgenie Pavlovitch with considerable\\r\\nsurprise.\\r\\n\\r\\nV.\\r\\n\\r\\nHippolyte, who had fallen asleep during Lebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s discourse, now\\r\\nsuddenly woke up, just as though someone had jogged him in the side. He\\r\\nshuddered, raised himself on his arm, gazed around, and grew very pale.\\r\\nA look almost of terror crossed his face as he recollected.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat! are they all off? Is it all over? Is the sun up?â\\x80\\x9d He trembled,\\r\\nand caught at the princeâ\\x80\\x99s hand. â\\x80\\x9cWhat time is it? Tell me, quick, for\\r\\ngoodnessâ\\x80\\x99 sake! How long have I slept?â\\x80\\x9d he added, almost in despair,\\r\\njust as though he had overslept something upon which his whole fate\\r\\ndepended.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have slept seven or perhaps eight minutes,â\\x80\\x9d said Evgenie\\r\\nPavlovitch.\\r\\n\\r\\nHippolyte gazed eagerly at the latter, and mused for a few moments.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, is that all?â\\x80\\x9d he said at last. â\\x80\\x9cThen Iâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe drew a long, deep breath of relief, as it seemed. He realized that\\r\\nall was not over as yet, that the sun had not risen, and that the\\r\\nguests had merely gone to supper. He smiled, and two hectic spots\\r\\nappeared on his cheeks.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo you counted the minutes while I slept, did you, Evgenie\\r\\nPavlovitch?â\\x80\\x9d he said, ironically. â\\x80\\x9cYou have not taken your eyes off me\\r\\nall the eveningâ\\x80\\x94I have noticed that much, you see! Ah, Rogojin! Iâ\\x80\\x99ve\\r\\njust been dreaming about him, prince,â\\x80\\x9d he added, frowning. â\\x80\\x9cYes, by the\\r\\nby,â\\x80\\x9d starting up, â\\x80\\x9cwhereâ\\x80\\x99s the orator? Whereâ\\x80\\x99s Lebedeff? Has he\\r\\nfinished? What did he talk about? Is it true, prince, that you once\\r\\ndeclared that â\\x80\\x98beauty would save the worldâ\\x80\\x99? Great Heaven! The prince\\r\\nsays that beauty saves the world! And I declare that he only has such\\r\\nplayful ideas because heâ\\x80\\x99s in love! Gentlemen, the prince is in love. I\\r\\nguessed it the moment he came in. Donâ\\x80\\x99t blush, prince; you make me\\r\\nsorry for you. What beauty saves the world? Colia told me that you are\\r\\na zealous Christian; is it so? Colia says you call yourself a\\r\\nChristian.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince regarded him attentively, but said nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou donâ\\x80\\x99t answer me; perhaps you think I am very fond of you?â\\x80\\x9d added\\r\\nHippolyte, as though the words had been drawn from him.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I donâ\\x80\\x99t think that. I know you donâ\\x80\\x99t love me.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat, after yesterday? Wasnâ\\x80\\x99t I honest with you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI knew yesterday that you didnâ\\x80\\x99t love me.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy so? why so? Because I envy you, eh? You always think that, I know.\\r\\nBut do you know why I am saying all this? Look here! I must have some\\r\\nmore champagneâ\\x80\\x94pour me out some, Keller, will you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, youâ\\x80\\x99re not to drink any more, Hippolyte. I wonâ\\x80\\x99t let you.â\\x80\\x9d The\\r\\nprince moved the glass away.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell perhaps youâ\\x80\\x99re right,â\\x80\\x9d said Hippolyte, musing. â\\x80\\x9cThey might\\r\\nsayâ\\x80\\x94yet, devil take them! what does it matter?â\\x80\\x94prince, what can it\\r\\nmatter what people will say of us _then_, eh? I believe Iâ\\x80\\x99m half\\r\\nasleep. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve had such a dreadful dreamâ\\x80\\x94Iâ\\x80\\x99ve only just remembered it.\\r\\nPrince, I donâ\\x80\\x99t wish you such dreams as that, though sure enough,\\r\\nperhaps, I _donâ\\x80\\x99t_ love you. Why wish a man evil, though you do not\\r\\nlove him, eh? Give me your handâ\\x80\\x94let me press it sincerely. Thereâ\\x80\\x94youâ\\x80\\x99ve\\r\\ngiven me your handâ\\x80\\x94you must feel that I _do_ press it sincerely, donâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nyou? I donâ\\x80\\x99t think I shall drink any more. What time is it? Never mind,\\r\\nI know the time. The time has come, at all events. What! they are\\r\\nlaying supper over there, are they? Then this table is free? Capital,\\r\\ngentlemen! Iâ\\x80\\x94hem! these gentlemen are not listening. Prince, I will\\r\\njust read over an article I have here. Supper is more interesting, of\\r\\ncourse, butâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Hippolyte suddenly, and most unexpectedly, pulled out of his\\r\\nbreast-pocket a large sealed paper. This imposing-looking document he\\r\\nplaced upon the table before him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe effect of this sudden action upon the company was instantaneous.\\r\\nEvgenie Pavlovitch almost bounded off his chair in excitement. Rogojin\\r\\ndrew nearer to the table with a look on his face as if he knew what was\\r\\ncoming. Gania came nearer too; so did Lebedeff and the othersâ\\x80\\x94the paper\\r\\nseemed to be an object of great interest to the company in general.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat have you got there?â\\x80\\x9d asked the prince, with some anxiety.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAt the first glimpse of the rising sun, prince, I will go to bed. I\\r\\ntold you I would, word of honour! You shall see!â\\x80\\x9d cried Hippolyte. â\\x80\\x9cYou\\r\\nthink Iâ\\x80\\x99m not capable of opening this packet, do you?â\\x80\\x9d He glared\\r\\ndefiantly round at the audience in general.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince observed that he was trembling all over.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNone of us ever thought such a thing!â\\x80\\x9d Muishkin replied for all. â\\x80\\x9cWhy\\r\\nshould you suppose it of us? And what are you going to read, Hippolyte?\\r\\nWhat is it?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, what is it?â\\x80\\x9d asked others. The packet sealed with red wax seemed\\r\\nto attract everyone, as though it were a magnet.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI wrote this yesterday, myself, just after I saw you, prince, and told\\r\\nyou I would come down here. I wrote all day and all night, and finished\\r\\nit this morning early. Afterwards I had a dream.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHadnâ\\x80\\x99t we better hear it tomorrow?â\\x80\\x9d asked the prince timidly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTomorrow â\\x80\\x98there will be no more time!â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d laughed Hippolyte,\\r\\nhysterically. â\\x80\\x9cYou neednâ\\x80\\x99t be afraid; I shall get through the whole\\r\\nthing in forty minutes, at most an hour! Look how interested everybody\\r\\nis! Everybody has drawn near. Look! look at them all staring at my\\r\\nsealed packet! If I hadnâ\\x80\\x99t sealed it up it wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have been half so\\r\\neffective! Ha, ha! thatâ\\x80\\x99s mystery, that is! Now then, gentlemen, shall\\r\\nI break the seal or not? Say the word; itâ\\x80\\x99s a mystery, I tell youâ\\x80\\x94a\\r\\nsecret! Prince, you know who said there would be â\\x80\\x98no more timeâ\\x80\\x99? It was\\r\\nthe great and powerful angel in the Apocalypse.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBetter not read it now,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, putting his hand on the\\r\\npacket.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, donâ\\x80\\x99t read it!â\\x80\\x9d cried Evgenie suddenly. He appeared so strangely\\r\\ndisturbed that many of those present could not help wondering.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cReading? None of your reading now!â\\x80\\x9d said somebody; â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s supper-time.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat sort of an article is it? For a paper? Probably itâ\\x80\\x99s very dull,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nsaid another. But the princeâ\\x80\\x99s timid gesture had impressed even\\r\\nHippolyte.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen Iâ\\x80\\x99m not to read it?â\\x80\\x9d he whispered, nervously. â\\x80\\x9cAm I not to read\\r\\nit?â\\x80\\x9d he repeated, gazing around at each face in turn. â\\x80\\x9cWhat are you\\r\\nafraid of, prince?â\\x80\\x9d he turned and asked the latter suddenly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat should I be afraid of?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHas anyone a coin about them? Give me a twenty-copeck piece,\\r\\nsomebody!â\\x80\\x9d And Hippolyte leapt from his chair.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHere you are,â\\x80\\x9d said Lebedeff, handing him one; he thought the boy had\\r\\ngone mad.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVera Lukianovna,â\\x80\\x9d said Hippolyte, â\\x80\\x9ctoss it, will you? Heads, I read,\\r\\ntails, I donâ\\x80\\x99t.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nVera Lebedeff tossed the coin into the air and let it fall on the\\r\\ntable.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was â\\x80\\x9cheads.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen I read it,â\\x80\\x9d said Hippolyte, in the tone of one bowing to the fiat\\r\\nof destiny. He could not have grown paler if a verdict of death had\\r\\nsuddenly been presented to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut after all, what is it? Is it possible that I should have just\\r\\nrisked my fate by tossing up?â\\x80\\x9d he went on, shuddering; and looked round\\r\\nhim again. His eyes had a curious expression of sincerity. â\\x80\\x9cThat is an\\r\\nastonishing psychological fact,â\\x80\\x9d he cried, suddenly addressing the\\r\\nprince, in a tone of the most intense surprise. â\\x80\\x9cIt is... it is\\r\\nsomething quite inconceivable, prince,â\\x80\\x9d he repeated with growing\\r\\nanimation, like a man regaining consciousness. â\\x80\\x9cTake note of it,\\r\\nprince, remember it; you collect, I am told, facts concerning capital\\r\\npunishment... They told me so. Ha, ha! My God, how absurd!â\\x80\\x9d He sat down\\r\\non the sofa, put his elbows on the table, and laid his head on his\\r\\nhands. â\\x80\\x9cIt is shamefulâ\\x80\\x94though what does it matter to me if it is\\r\\nshameful?\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGentlemen, gentlemen! I am about to break the seal,â\\x80\\x9d he continued,\\r\\nwith determination. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x94Iâ\\x80\\x94of course I donâ\\x80\\x99t insist upon anyone listening\\r\\nif they do not wish to.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWith trembling fingers he broke the seal and drew out several sheets of\\r\\npaper, smoothed them out before him, and began sorting them.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat on earth does all this mean? Whatâ\\x80\\x99s he going to read?â\\x80\\x9d muttered\\r\\nseveral voices. Others said nothing; but one and all sat down and\\r\\nwatched with curiosity. They began to think something strange might\\r\\nreally be about to happen. Vera stood and trembled behind her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nchair, almost in tears with fright; Colia was nearly as much alarmed as\\r\\nshe was. Lebedeff jumped up and put a couple of candles nearer to\\r\\nHippolyte, so that he might see better.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGentlemen, thisâ\\x80\\x94youâ\\x80\\x99ll soon see what this is,â\\x80\\x9d began Hippolyte, and\\r\\nsuddenly commenced his reading.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s headed, â\\x80\\x98A Necessary Explanation,â\\x80\\x99 with the motto, â\\x80\\x98_AprÃ¨s moi le\\r\\ndÃ©luge!_â\\x80\\x99 Oh, deuce take it all! Surely I can never have seriously\\r\\nwritten such a silly motto as that? Look here, gentlemen, I beg to give\\r\\nnotice that all this is very likely terrible nonsense. It is only a few\\r\\nideas of mine. If you think that there is anything mysterious comingâ\\x80\\x94or\\r\\nin a wordâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBetter read on without any more beating about the bush,â\\x80\\x9d said Gania.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAffectation!â\\x80\\x9d remarked someone else.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cToo much talk,â\\x80\\x9d said Rogojin, breaking the silence for the first time.\\r\\n\\r\\nHippolyte glanced at him suddenly, and when their eyes met Rogojin\\r\\nshowed his teeth in a disagreeable smile, and said the following\\r\\nstrange words: â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s not the way to settle this business, my friend;\\r\\nthatâ\\x80\\x99s not the way at all.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course nobody knew what Rogojin meant by this; but his words made a\\r\\ndeep impression upon all. Everyone seemed to see in a flash the same\\r\\nidea.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for Hippolyte, their effect upon him was astounding. He trembled so\\r\\nthat the prince was obliged to support him, and would certainly have\\r\\ncried out, but that his voice seemed to have entirely left him for the\\r\\nmoment. For a minute or two he could not speak at all, but panted and\\r\\nstared at Rogojin. At last he managed to ejaculate:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen it was _you_ who cameâ\\x80\\x94_you_â\\x80\\x94_you?_â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCame where? What do you mean?â\\x80\\x9d asked Rogojin, amazed. But Hippolyte,\\r\\npanting and choking with excitement, interrupted him violently.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_You_ came to me last week, in the night, at two oâ\\x80\\x99clock, the day I\\r\\nwas with you in the morning! Confess it was you!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLast week? In the night? Have you gone cracked, my good friend?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHippolyte paused and considered a moment. Then a smile of\\r\\ncunningâ\\x80\\x94almost triumphâ\\x80\\x94crossed his lips.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was you,â\\x80\\x9d he murmured, almost in a whisper, but with absolute\\r\\nconviction. â\\x80\\x9cYes, it was you who came to my room and sat silently on a\\r\\nchair at my window for a whole hourâ\\x80\\x94more! It was between one and two at\\r\\nnight; you rose and went out at about three. It was you, you! Why you\\r\\nshould have frightened me so, why you should have wished to torment me\\r\\nlike that, I cannot tellâ\\x80\\x94but you it was.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was absolute hatred in his eyes as he said this, but his look of\\r\\nfear and his trembling had not left him.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou shall hear all this directly, gentlemen. Iâ\\x80\\x94Iâ\\x80\\x94listen!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe seized his paper in a desperate hurry; he fidgeted with it, and\\r\\ntried to sort it, but for a long while his trembling hands could not\\r\\ncollect the sheets together. â\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s either mad or delirious,â\\x80\\x9d murmured\\r\\nRogojin. At last he began.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the first five minutes the readerâ\\x80\\x99s voice continued to tremble, and\\r\\nhe read disconnectedly and unevenly; but gradually his voice\\r\\nstrengthened. Occasionally a violent fit of coughing stopped him, but\\r\\nhis animation grew with the progress of the readingâ\\x80\\x94as did also the\\r\\ndisagreeable impression which it made upon his audience,â\\x80\\x94until it\\r\\nreached the highest pitch of excitement.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere is the article.\\r\\n\\r\\nMY NECESSARY EXPLANATION.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_AprÃ¨s moi le dÃ©luge._\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYesterday morning the prince came to see me. Among other things he\\r\\nasked me to come down to his villa. I knew he would come and persuade\\r\\nme to this step, and that he would adduce the argument that it would be\\r\\neasier for me to die â\\x80\\x98among people and green trees,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x94as he expressed\\r\\nit. But today he did not say â\\x80\\x98die,â\\x80\\x99 he said â\\x80\\x98live.â\\x80\\x99 It is pretty much\\r\\nthe same to me, in my position, which he says. When I asked him why he\\r\\nmade such a point of his â\\x80\\x98green trees,â\\x80\\x99 he told me, to my astonishment,\\r\\nthat he had heard that last time I was in Pavlofsk I had said that I\\r\\nhad come â\\x80\\x98to have a last look at the trees.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen I observed that it was all the same whether one died among trees\\r\\nor in front of a blank brick wall, as here, and that it was not worth\\r\\nmaking any fuss over a fortnight, he agreed at once. But he insisted\\r\\nthat the good air at Pavlofsk and the greenness would certainly cause a\\r\\nphysical change for the better, and that my excitement, and my\\r\\n_dreams_, would be perhaps relieved. I remarked to him, with a smile,\\r\\nthat he spoke like a materialist, and he answered that he had always\\r\\nbeen one. As he never tells a lie, there must be something in his\\r\\nwords. His smile is a pleasant one. I have had a good look at him. I\\r\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t know whether I like him or not; and I have no time to waste over\\r\\nthe question. The hatred which I felt for him for five months has\\r\\nbecome considerably modified, I may say, during the last month. Who\\r\\nknows, perhaps I am going to Pavlofsk on purpose to see him! But why do\\r\\nI leave my chamber? Those who are sentenced to death should not leave\\r\\ntheir cells. If I had not formed a final resolve, but had decided to\\r\\nwait until the last minute, I should not leave my room, or accept his\\r\\ninvitation to come and die at Pavlofsk. I must be quick and finish this\\r\\nexplanation before tomorrow. I shall have no time to read it over and\\r\\ncorrect it, for I must read it tomorrow to the prince and two or three\\r\\nwitnesses whom I shall probably find there.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAs it will be absolutely true, without a touch of falsehood, I am\\r\\ncurious to see what impression it will make upon me myself at the\\r\\nmoment when I read it out. This is my â\\x80\\x98last and solemnâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x94but why need I\\r\\ncall it that? There is no question about the truth of it, for it is not\\r\\nworthwhile lying for a fortnight; a fortnight of life is not itself\\r\\nworth having, which is a proof that I write nothing here but pure\\r\\ntruth.\\r\\n\\r\\n(â\\x80\\x9cN.B.â\\x80\\x94Let me remember to consider; am I mad at this moment, or not? or\\r\\nrather at these moments? I have been told that consumptives sometimes\\r\\ndo go out of their minds for a while in the last stages of the malady.\\r\\nI can prove this tomorrow when I read it out, by the impression it\\r\\nmakes upon the audience. I must settle this question once and for all,\\r\\notherwise I canâ\\x80\\x99t go on with anything.)\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI believe I have just written dreadful nonsense; but thereâ\\x80\\x99s no time\\r\\nfor correcting, as I said before. Besides that, I have made myself a\\r\\npromise not to alter a single word of what I write in this paper, even\\r\\nthough I find that I am contradicting myself every five lines. I wish\\r\\nto verify the working of the natural logic of my ideas tomorrow during\\r\\nthe readingâ\\x80\\x94whether I am capable of detecting logical errors, and\\r\\nwhether all that I have meditated over during the last six months be\\r\\ntrue, or nothing but delirium.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf two months since I had been called upon to leave my room and the\\r\\nview of Meyerâ\\x80\\x99s wall opposite, I verily believe I should have been\\r\\nsorry. But now I have no such feeling, and yet I am leaving this room\\r\\nand Meyerâ\\x80\\x99s brick wall _for ever_. So that my conclusion, that it is\\r\\nnot worth while indulging in grief, or any other emotion, for a\\r\\nfortnight, has proved stronger than my very nature, and has taken over\\r\\nthe direction of my feelings. But is it so? Is it the case that my\\r\\nnature is conquered entirely? If I were to be put on the rack now, I\\r\\nshould certainly cry out. I should not say that it is not worth while\\r\\nto yell and feel pain because I have but a fortnight to live.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut is it true that I have but a fortnight of life left to me? I know\\r\\nI told some of my friends that Doctor B. had informed me that this was\\r\\nthe case; but I now confess that I lied; B. has not even seen me.\\r\\nHowever, a week ago, I called in a medical student, Kislorodoff, who is\\r\\na Nationalist, an Atheist, and a Nihilist, by conviction, and that is\\r\\nwhy I had him. I needed a man who would tell me the bare truth without\\r\\nany humbug or ceremonyâ\\x80\\x94and so he didâ\\x80\\x94indeed, almost with pleasure\\r\\n(which I thought was going a little too far).\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, he plumped out that I had about a month left me; it might be a\\r\\nlittle more, he said, under favourable circumstances, but it might also\\r\\nbe considerably less. According to his opinion I might die quite\\r\\nsuddenlyâ\\x80\\x94tomorrow, for instanceâ\\x80\\x94there had been such cases. Only a day\\r\\nor two since a young lady at Colomna who suffered from consumption, and\\r\\nwas about on a par with myself in the march of the disease, was going\\r\\nout to market to buy provisions, when she suddenly felt faint, lay down\\r\\non the sofa, gasped once, and died.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cKislorodoff told me all this with a sort of exaggerated devil-may-care\\r\\nnegligence, and as though he did me great honour by talking to me so,\\r\\nbecause it showed that he considered me the same sort of exalted\\r\\nNihilistic being as himself, to whom death was a matter of no\\r\\nconsequence whatever, either way.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAt all events, the fact remainedâ\\x80\\x94a month of life and no more! That he\\r\\nis right in his estimation I am absolutely persuaded.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt puzzles me much to think how on earth the prince guessed yesterday\\r\\nthat I have had bad dreams. He said to me, â\\x80\\x98Your excitement and dreams\\r\\nwill find relief at Pavlofsk.â\\x80\\x99 Why did he say â\\x80\\x98dreamsâ\\x80\\x99? Either he is a\\r\\ndoctor, or else he is a man of exceptional intelligence and wonderful\\r\\npowers of observation. (But that he is an â\\x80\\x98idiot,â\\x80\\x99 at bottom there can\\r\\nbe no doubt whatever.) It so happened that just before he arrived I had\\r\\na delightful little dream; one of a kind that I have hundreds of just\\r\\nnow. I had fallen asleep about an hour before he came in, and dreamed\\r\\nthat I was in some room, not my own. It was a large room, well\\r\\nfurnished, with a cupboard, chest of drawers, sofa, and my bed, a fine\\r\\nwide bed covered with a silken counterpane. But I observed in the room\\r\\na dreadful-looking creature, a sort of monster. It was a little like a\\r\\nscorpion, but was not a scorpion, but far more horrible, and especially\\r\\nso, because there are no creatures anything like it in nature, and\\r\\nbecause it had appeared to me for a purpose, and bore some mysterious\\r\\nsignification. I looked at the beast well; it was brown in colour and\\r\\nhad a shell; it was a crawling kind of reptile, about eight inches\\r\\nlong, and narrowed down from the head, which was about a couple of\\r\\nfingers in width, to the end of the tail, which came to a fine point.\\r\\nOut of its trunk, about a couple of inches below its head, came two\\r\\nlegs at an angle of forty-five degrees, each about three inches long,\\r\\nso that the beast looked like a trident from above. It had eight hard\\r\\nneedle-like whiskers coming out from different parts of its body; it\\r\\nwent along like a snake, bending its body about in spite of the shell\\r\\nit wore, and its motion was very quick and very horrible to look at. I\\r\\nwas dreadfully afraid it would sting me; somebody had told me, I\\r\\nthought, that it was venomous; but what tormented me most of all was\\r\\nthe wondering and wondering as to who had sent it into my room, and\\r\\nwhat was the mystery which I felt it contained.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt hid itself under the cupboard and under the chest of drawers, and\\r\\ncrawled into the corners. I sat on a chair and kept my legs tucked\\r\\nunder me. Then the beast crawled quietly across the room and\\r\\ndisappeared somewhere near my chair. I looked about for it in terror,\\r\\nbut I still hoped that as my feet were safely tucked away it would not\\r\\nbe able to touch me.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSuddenly I heard behind me, and about on a level with my head, a sort\\r\\nof rattling sound. I turned sharp round and saw that the brute had\\r\\ncrawled up the wall as high as the level of my face, and that its\\r\\nhorrible tail, which was moving incredibly fast from side to side, was\\r\\nactually touching my hair! I jumped upâ\\x80\\x94and it disappeared. I did not\\r\\ndare lie down on my bed for fear it should creep under my pillow. My\\r\\nmother came into the room, and some friends of hers. They began to hunt\\r\\nfor the reptile and were more composed than I was; they did not seem to\\r\\nbe afraid of it. But they did not understand as I did.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSuddenly the monster reappeared; it crawled slowly across the room and\\r\\nmade for the door, as though with some fixed intention, and with a slow\\r\\nmovement that was more horrible than ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen my mother opened the door and called my dog, Norma. Norma was a\\r\\ngreat Newfoundland, and died five years ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe sprang forward and stood still in front of the reptile as if she\\r\\nhad been turned to stone. The beast stopped too, but its tail and claws\\r\\nstill moved about. I believe animals are incapable of feeling\\r\\nsupernatural frightâ\\x80\\x94if I have been rightly informed,â\\x80\\x94but at this moment\\r\\nthere appeared to me to be something more than ordinary about Normaâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nterror, as though it must be supernatural; and as though she felt, just\\r\\nas I did myself, that this reptile was connected with some mysterious\\r\\nsecret, some fatal omen.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNorma backed slowly and carefully away from the brute, which followed\\r\\nher, creeping deliberately after her as though it intended to make a\\r\\nsudden dart and sting her.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn spite of Normaâ\\x80\\x99s terror she looked furious, though she trembled in\\r\\nall her limbs. At length she slowly bared her terrible teeth, opened\\r\\nher great red jaws, hesitatedâ\\x80\\x94took courage, and seized the beast in her\\r\\nmouth. It seemed to try to dart out of her jaws twice, but Norma caught\\r\\nat it and half swallowed it as it was escaping. The shell cracked in\\r\\nher teeth; and the tail and legs stuck out of her mouth and shook about\\r\\nin a horrible manner. Suddenly Norma gave a piteous whine; the reptile\\r\\nhad bitten her tongue. She opened her mouth wide with the pain, and I\\r\\nsaw the beast lying across her tongue, and out of its body, which was\\r\\nalmost bitten in two, came a hideous white-looking substance, oozing\\r\\nout into Normaâ\\x80\\x99s mouth; it was of the consistency of a crushed\\r\\nblack-beetle. Just then I awoke and the prince entered the room.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGentlemen!â\\x80\\x9d said Hippolyte, breaking off here, â\\x80\\x9cI have not done yet,\\r\\nbut it seems to me that I have written down a great deal here that is\\r\\nunnecessary,â\\x80\\x94this dreamâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have indeed!â\\x80\\x9d said Gania.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere is too much about myself, I know, butâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d As Hippolyte said this\\r\\nhis face wore a tired, pained look, and he wiped the sweat off his\\r\\nbrow.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d said Lebedeff, â\\x80\\x9cyou certainly think a great deal too much about\\r\\nyourself.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWellâ\\x80\\x94gentlemenâ\\x80\\x94I do not force anyone to listen! If any of you are\\r\\nunwilling to sit it out, please go away, by all means!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe turns people out of a house that isnâ\\x80\\x99t his own,â\\x80\\x9d muttered Rogojin.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSuppose we all go away?â\\x80\\x9d said Ferdishenko suddenly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHippolyte clutched his manuscript, and gazing at the last speaker with\\r\\nglittering eyes, said: â\\x80\\x9cYou donâ\\x80\\x99t like me at all!â\\x80\\x9d A few laughed at\\r\\nthis, but not all.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHippolyte,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, â\\x80\\x9cgive me the papers, and go to bed like a\\r\\nsensible fellow. Weâ\\x80\\x99ll have a good talk tomorrow, but you really\\r\\nmustnâ\\x80\\x99t go on with this reading; it is not good for you!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow can I? How can I?â\\x80\\x9d cried Hippolyte, looking at him in amazement.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGentlemen! I was a fool! I wonâ\\x80\\x99t break off again. Listen, everyone who\\r\\nwants to!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe gulped down some water out of a glass standing near, bent over the\\r\\ntable, in order to hide his face from the audience, and recommenced.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe idea that it is not worth while living for a few weeks took\\r\\npossession of me a month ago, when I was told that I had four weeks to\\r\\nlive, but only partially so at that time. The idea quite overmastered\\r\\nme three days since, that evening at Pavlofsk. The first time that I\\r\\nfelt really impressed with this thought was on the terrace at the\\r\\nprinceâ\\x80\\x99s, at the very moment when I had taken it into my head to make a\\r\\nlast trial of life. I wanted to see people and trees (I believe I said\\r\\nso myself), I got excited, I maintained Burdovskyâ\\x80\\x99s rights, â\\x80\\x98my\\r\\nneighbour!â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x94I dreamt that one and all would open their arms, and\\r\\nembrace me, that there would be an indescribable exchange of\\r\\nforgiveness between us all! In a word, I behaved like a fool, and then,\\r\\nat that very same instant, I felt my â\\x80\\x98last conviction.â\\x80\\x99 I ask myself\\r\\nnow how I could have waited six months for that conviction! I knew that\\r\\nI had a disease that spares no one, and I really had no illusions; but\\r\\nthe more I realized my condition, the more I clung to life; I wanted to\\r\\nlive at any price. I confess I might well have resented that blind,\\r\\ndeaf fate, which, with no apparent reason, seemed to have decided to\\r\\ncrush me like a fly; but why did I not stop at resentment? Why did I\\r\\nbegin to live, knowing that it was not worthwhile to begin? Why did I\\r\\nattempt to do what I knew to be an impossibility? And yet I could not\\r\\neven read a book to the end; I had given up reading. What is the good\\r\\nof reading, what is the good of learning anything, for just six months?\\r\\nThat thought has made me throw aside a book more than once.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, that wall of Meyerâ\\x80\\x99s could tell a tale if it liked. There was no\\r\\nspot on its dirty surface that I did not know by heart. Accursed wall!\\r\\nand yet it is dearer to me than all the Pavlofsk trees!â\\x80\\x94That isâ\\x80\\x94it\\r\\n_would_ be dearer if it were not all the same to me, now!\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI remember now with what hungry interest I began to watch the lives of\\r\\nother peopleâ\\x80\\x94interest that I had never felt before! I used to wait for\\r\\nColiaâ\\x80\\x99s arrival impatiently, for I was so ill myself, then, that I\\r\\ncould not leave the house. I so threw myself into every little detail\\r\\nof news, and took so much interest in every report and rumour, that I\\r\\nbelieve I became a regular gossip! I could not understand, among other\\r\\nthings, how all these peopleâ\\x80\\x94with so much life in and before themâ\\x80\\x94do\\r\\nnot become _rich_â\\x80\\x94and I donâ\\x80\\x99t understand it now. I remember being told\\r\\nof a poor wretch I once knew, who had died of hunger. I was almost\\r\\nbeside myself with rage! I believe if I could have resuscitated him I\\r\\nwould have done so for the sole purpose of murdering him!\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOccasionally I was so much better that I could go out; but the streets\\r\\nused to put me in such a rage that I would lock myself up for days\\r\\nrather than go out, even if I were well enough to do so! I could not\\r\\nbear to see all those preoccupied, anxious-looking creatures\\r\\ncontinuously surging along the streets past me! Why are they always\\r\\nanxious? What is the meaning of their eternal care and worry? It is\\r\\ntheir wickedness, their perpetual detestable maliceâ\\x80\\x94thatâ\\x80\\x99s what it\\r\\nisâ\\x80\\x94they are all full of malice, malice!\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhose fault is it that they are all miserable, that they donâ\\x80\\x99t know\\r\\nhow to live, though they have fifty or sixty years of life before them?\\r\\nWhy did that fool allow himself to die of hunger with sixty years of\\r\\nunlived life before him?\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd everyone of them shows his rags, his toil-worn hands, and yells in\\r\\nhis wrath: â\\x80\\x98Here are we, working like cattle all our lives, and always\\r\\nas hungry as dogs, and there are others who do not work, and are fat\\r\\nand rich!â\\x80\\x99 The eternal refrain! And side by side with them trots along\\r\\nsome wretched fellow who has known better days, doing light porterâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nwork from morn to night for a living, always blubbering and saying that\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98his wife died because he had no money to buy medicine with,â\\x80\\x99 and his\\r\\nchildren dying of cold and hunger, and his eldest daughter gone to the\\r\\nbad, and so on. Oh! I have no pity and no patience for these fools of\\r\\npeople. Why canâ\\x80\\x99t they be Rothschilds? Whose fault is it that a man has\\r\\nnot got millions of money like Rothschild? If he has life, all this\\r\\nmust be in his power! Whose fault is it that he does not know how to\\r\\nlive his life?\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh! itâ\\x80\\x99s all the same to me nowâ\\x80\\x94_now!_ But at that time I would soak\\r\\nmy pillow at night with tears of mortification, and tear at my blanket\\r\\nin my rage and fury. Oh, how I longed at that time to be turned\\r\\noutâ\\x80\\x94_me_, eighteen years old, poor, half-clothed, turned out into the\\r\\nstreet, quite alone, without lodging, without work, without a crust of\\r\\nbread, without relations, without a single acquaintance, in some large\\r\\ntownâ\\x80\\x94hungry, beaten (if you like), but in good healthâ\\x80\\x94and _then_ I\\r\\nwould show themâ\\x80\\x94\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat would I show them?\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, donâ\\x80\\x99t think that I have no sense of my own humiliation! I have\\r\\nsuffered already in reading so far. Which of you all does not think me\\r\\na fool at this momentâ\\x80\\x94a young fool who knows nothing of lifeâ\\x80\\x94forgetting\\r\\nthat to live as I have lived these last six months is to live longer\\r\\nthan grey-haired old men. Well, let them laugh, and say it is all\\r\\nnonsense, if they please. They may say it is all fairy-tales, if they\\r\\nlike; and I have spent whole nights telling myself fairy-tales. I\\r\\nremember them all. But how can I tell fairy-tales now? The time for\\r\\nthem is over. They amused me when I found that there was not even time\\r\\nfor me to learn the Greek grammar, as I wanted to do. â\\x80\\x98I shall die\\r\\nbefore I get to the syntax,â\\x80\\x99 I thought at the first pageâ\\x80\\x94and threw the\\r\\nbook under the table. It is there still, for I forbade anyone to pick\\r\\nit up.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf this â\\x80\\x98Explanationâ\\x80\\x99 gets into anybodyâ\\x80\\x99s hands, and they have\\r\\npatience to read it through, they may consider me a madman, or a\\r\\nschoolboy, or, more likely, a man condemned to die, who thought it only\\r\\nnatural to conclude that all men, excepting himself, esteem life far\\r\\ntoo lightly, live it far too carelessly and lazily, and are, therefore,\\r\\none and all, unworthy of it. Well, I affirm that my reader is wrong\\r\\nagain, for my convictions have nothing to do with my sentence of death.\\r\\nAsk them, ask any one of them, or all of them, what they mean by\\r\\nhappiness! Oh, you may be perfectly sure that if Columbus was happy, it\\r\\nwas not after he had discovered America, but when he was discovering\\r\\nit! You may be quite sure that he reached the culminating point of his\\r\\nhappiness three days before he saw the New World with his actual eyes,\\r\\nwhen his mutinous sailors wanted to tack about, and return to Europe!\\r\\nWhat did the New World matter after all? Columbus had hardly seen it\\r\\nwhen he died, and in reality he was entirely ignorant of what he had\\r\\ndiscovered. The important thing is lifeâ\\x80\\x94life and nothing else! What is\\r\\nany â\\x80\\x98discoveryâ\\x80\\x99 whatever compared with the incessant, eternal discovery\\r\\nof life?\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut what is the use of talking? Iâ\\x80\\x99m afraid all this is so commonplace\\r\\nthat my confession will be taken for a schoolboy exerciseâ\\x80\\x94the work of\\r\\nsome ambitious lad writing in the hope of his work â\\x80\\x98seeing the lightâ\\x80\\x99;\\r\\nor perhaps my readers will say that â\\x80\\x98I had perhaps something to say,\\r\\nbut did not know how to express it.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLet me add to this that in every idea emanating from genius, or even\\r\\nin every serious human ideaâ\\x80\\x94born in the human brainâ\\x80\\x94there always\\r\\nremains somethingâ\\x80\\x94some sedimentâ\\x80\\x94which cannot be expressed to others,\\r\\nthough one wrote volumes and lectured upon it for five-and-thirty\\r\\nyears. There is always a something, a remnant, which will never come\\r\\nout from your brain, but will remain there with you, and you alone, for\\r\\never and ever, and you will die, perhaps, without having imparted what\\r\\nmay be the very essence of your idea to a single living soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo that if I cannot now impart all that has tormented me for the last\\r\\nsix months, at all events you will understand that, having reached my\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98last convictions,â\\x80\\x99 I must have paid a very dear price for them. That\\r\\nis what I wished, for reasons of my own, to make a point of in this my\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Explanation.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut let me resume.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nVI.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI will not deceive you. â\\x80\\x98Realityâ\\x80\\x99 got me so entrapped in its meshes\\r\\nnow and again during the past six months, that I forgot my â\\x80\\x98sentenceâ\\x80\\x99\\r\\n(or perhaps I did not wish to think of it), and actually busied myself\\r\\nwith affairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA word as to my circumstances. When, eight months since, I became very\\r\\nill, I threw up all my old connections and dropped all my old\\r\\ncompanions. As I was always a gloomy, morose sort of individual, my\\r\\nfriends easily forgot me; of course, they would have forgotten me all\\r\\nthe same, without that excuse. My position at home was solitary enough.\\r\\nFive months ago I separated myself entirely from the family, and no one\\r\\ndared enter my room except at stated times, to clean and tidy it, and\\r\\nso on, and to bring me my meals. My mother dared not disobey me; she\\r\\nkept the children quiet, for my sake, and beat them if they dared to\\r\\nmake any noise and disturb me. I so often complained of them that I\\r\\nshould think they must be very fond, indeed, of me by this time. I\\r\\nthink I must have tormented â\\x80\\x98my faithful Coliaâ\\x80\\x99 (as I called him) a\\r\\ngood deal too. He tormented me of late; I could see that he always bore\\r\\nmy tempers as though he had determined to â\\x80\\x98spare the poor invalid.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nThis annoyed me, naturally. He seemed to have taken it into his head to\\r\\nimitate the prince in Christian meekness! Surikoff, who lived above us,\\r\\nannoyed me, too. He was so miserably poor, and I used to prove to him\\r\\nthat he had no one to blame but himself for his poverty. I used to be\\r\\nso angry that I think I frightened him eventually, for he stopped\\r\\ncoming to see me. He was a most meek and humble fellow, was Surikoff.\\r\\n(N.B.â\\x80\\x94They say that meekness is a great power. I must ask the prince\\r\\nabout this, for the expression is his.) But I remember one day in\\r\\nMarch, when I went up to his lodgings to see whether it was true that\\r\\none of his children had been starved and frozen to death, I began to\\r\\nhold forth to him about his poverty being his own fault, and, in the\\r\\ncourse of my remarks, I accidentally smiled at the corpse of his child.\\r\\nWell, the poor wretchâ\\x80\\x99s lips began to tremble, and he caught me by the\\r\\nshoulder, and pushed me to the door. â\\x80\\x98Go out,â\\x80\\x99 he said, in a whisper. I\\r\\nwent out, of course, and I declare I _liked_ it. I liked it at the very\\r\\nmoment when I was turned out. But his words filled me with a strange\\r\\nsort of feeling of disdainful pity for him whenever I thought of themâ\\x80\\x94a\\r\\nfeeling which I did not in the least desire to entertain. At the very\\r\\nmoment of the insult (for I admit that I did insult him, though I did\\r\\nnot mean to), this man could not lose his temper. His lips had\\r\\ntrembled, but I swear it was not with rage. He had taken me by the arm,\\r\\nand said, â\\x80\\x98Go out,â\\x80\\x99 without the least anger. There was dignity, a great\\r\\ndeal of dignity, about him, and it was so inconsistent with the look of\\r\\nhim that, I assure you, it was quite comical. But there was no anger.\\r\\nPerhaps he merely began to despise me at that moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSince that time he has always taken off his hat to me on the stairs,\\r\\nwhenever I met him, which is a thing he never did before; but he always\\r\\ngets away from me as quickly as he can, as though he felt confused. If\\r\\nhe did despise me, he despised me â\\x80\\x98meekly,â\\x80\\x99 after his own fashion.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI dare say he only took his hat off out of fear, as it were, to the\\r\\nson of his creditor; for he always owed my mother money. I thought of\\r\\nhaving an explanation with him, but I knew that if I did, he would\\r\\nbegin to apologize in a minute or two, so I decided to let him alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cJust about that time, that is, the middle of March, I suddenly felt\\r\\nvery much better; this continued for a couple of weeks. I used to go\\r\\nout at dusk. I like the dusk, especially in March, when the night frost\\r\\nbegins to harden the dayâ\\x80\\x99s puddles, and the gas is burning.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, one night in the Shestilavochnaya, a man passed me with a paper\\r\\nparcel under his arm. I did not take stock of him very carefully, but\\r\\nhe seemed to be dressed in some shabby summer dust-coat, much too light\\r\\nfor the season. When he was opposite the lamp-post, some ten yards\\r\\naway, I observed something fall out of his pocket. I hurried forward to\\r\\npick it up, just in time, for an old wretch in a long kaftan rushed up\\r\\ntoo. He did not dispute the matter, but glanced at what was in my hand\\r\\nand disappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was a large old-fashioned pocket-book, stuffed full; but I guessed,\\r\\nat a glance, that it had anything in the world inside it, except money.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe owner was now some forty yards ahead of me, and was very soon lost\\r\\nin the crowd. I ran after him, and began calling out; but as I knew\\r\\nnothing to say excepting â\\x80\\x98hey!â\\x80\\x99 he did not turn round. Suddenly he\\r\\nturned into the gate of a house to the left; and when I darted in after\\r\\nhim, the gateway was so dark that I could see nothing whatever. It was\\r\\none of those large houses built in small tenements, of which there must\\r\\nhave been at least a hundred.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen I entered the yard I thought I saw a man going along on the far\\r\\nside of it; but it was so dark I could not make out his figure.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI crossed to that corner and found a dirty dark staircase. I heard a\\r\\nman mounting up above me, some way higher than I was, and thinking I\\r\\nshould catch him before his door would be opened to him, I rushed after\\r\\nhim. I heard a door open and shut on the fifth storey, as I panted\\r\\nalong; the stairs were narrow, and the steps innumerable, but at last I\\r\\nreached the door I thought the right one. Some moments passed before I\\r\\nfound the bell and got it to ring.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAn old peasant woman opened the door; she was busy lighting the\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98samovarâ\\x80\\x99 in a tiny kitchen. She listened silently to my questions, did\\r\\nnot understand a word, of course, and opened another door leading into\\r\\na little bit of a room, low and scarcely furnished at all, but with a\\r\\nlarge, wide bed in it, hung with curtains. On this bed lay one\\r\\nTerentich, as the woman called him, drunk, it appeared to me. On the\\r\\ntable was an end of candle in an iron candlestick, and a half-bottle of\\r\\nvodka, nearly finished. Terentich muttered something to me, and signed\\r\\ntowards the next room. The old woman had disappeared, so there was\\r\\nnothing for me to do but to open the door indicated. I did so, and\\r\\nentered the next room.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis was still smaller than the other, so cramped that I could\\r\\nscarcely turn round; a narrow single bed at one side took up nearly all\\r\\nthe room. Besides the bed there were only three common chairs, and a\\r\\nwretched old kitchen-table standing before a small sofa. One could\\r\\nhardly squeeze through between the table and the bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOn the table, as in the other room, burned a tallow candle-end in an\\r\\niron candlestick; and on the bed there whined a baby of scarcely three\\r\\nweeks old. A pale-looking woman was dressing the child, probably the\\r\\nmother; she looked as though she had not as yet got over the trouble of\\r\\nchildbirth, she seemed so weak and was so carelessly dressed. Another\\r\\nchild, a little girl of about three years old, lay on the sofa, covered\\r\\nover with what looked like a manâ\\x80\\x99s old dress-coat.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAt the table stood a man in his shirt sleeves; he had thrown off his\\r\\ncoat; it lay upon the bed; and he was unfolding a blue paper parcel in\\r\\nwhich were a couple of pounds of bread, and some little sausages.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOn the table along with these things were a few old bits of black\\r\\nbread, and some tea in a pot. From under the bed there protruded an\\r\\nopen portmanteau full of bundles of rags. In a word, the confusion and\\r\\nuntidiness of the room were indescribable.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt appeared to me, at the first glance, that both the man and the\\r\\nwoman were respectable people, but brought to that pitch of poverty\\r\\nwhere untidiness seems to get the better of every effort to cope with\\r\\nit, till at last they take a sort of bitter satisfaction in it. When I\\r\\nentered the room, the man, who had entered but a moment before me, and\\r\\nwas still unpacking his parcels, was saying something to his wife in an\\r\\nexcited manner. The news was apparently bad, as usual, for the woman\\r\\nbegan whimpering. The manâ\\x80\\x99s face seemed to me to be refined and even\\r\\npleasant. He was dark-complexioned, and about twenty-eight years of\\r\\nage; he wore black whiskers, and his lip and chin were shaved. He\\r\\nlooked morose, but with a sort of pride of expression. A curious scene\\r\\nfollowed.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere are people who find satisfaction in their own touchy feelings,\\r\\nespecially when they have just taken the deepest offence; at such\\r\\nmoments they feel that they would rather be offended than not. These\\r\\neasily-ignited natures, if they are wise, are always full of remorse\\r\\nafterwards, when they reflect that they have been ten times as angry as\\r\\nthey need have been.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe gentleman before me gazed at me for some seconds in amazement, and\\r\\nhis wife in terror; as though there was something alarmingly\\r\\nextraordinary in the fact that anyone could come to see them. But\\r\\nsuddenly he fell upon me almost with fury; I had had no time to mutter\\r\\nmore than a couple of words; but he had doubtless observed that I was\\r\\ndecently dressed and, therefore, took deep offence because I had dared\\r\\nenter his den so unceremoniously, and spy out the squalor and\\r\\nuntidiness of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course he was delighted to get hold of someone upon whom to vent\\r\\nhis rage against things in general.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFor a moment I thought he would assault me; he grew so pale that he\\r\\nlooked like a woman about to have hysterics; his wife was dreadfully\\r\\nalarmed.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98How dare you come in so? Be off!â\\x80\\x99 he shouted, trembling all over with\\r\\nrage and scarcely able to articulate the words. Suddenly, however, he\\r\\nobserved his pocketbook in my hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98I think you dropped this,â\\x80\\x99 I remarked, as quietly and drily as I\\r\\ncould. (I thought it best to treat him so.) For some while he stood\\r\\nbefore me in downright terror, and seemed unable to understand. He then\\r\\nsuddenly grabbed at his side-pocket, opened his mouth in alarm, and\\r\\nbeat his forehead with his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98My God!â\\x80\\x99 he cried, â\\x80\\x98where did you find it? How?â\\x80\\x99 I explained in as\\r\\nfew words as I could, and as drily as possible, how I had seen it and\\r\\npicked it up; how I had run after him, and called out to him, and how I\\r\\nhad followed him upstairs and groped my way to his door.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Gracious Heaven!â\\x80\\x99 he cried, â\\x80\\x98all our papers are in it! My dear sir,\\r\\nyou little know what you have done for us. I should have been\\r\\nlostâ\\x80\\x94lost!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI had taken hold of the door-handle meanwhile, intending to leave the\\r\\nroom without reply; but I was panting with my run upstairs, and my\\r\\nexhaustion came to a climax in a violent fit of coughing, so bad that I\\r\\ncould hardly stand.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI saw how the man dashed about the room to find me an empty chair, how\\r\\nhe kicked the rags off a chair which was covered up by them, brought it\\r\\nto me, and helped me to sit down; but my cough went on for another\\r\\nthree minutes or so. When I came to myself he was sitting by me on\\r\\nanother chair, which he had also cleared of the rubbish by throwing it\\r\\nall over the floor, and was watching me intently.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99m afraid you are ill?â\\x80\\x99 he remarked, in the tone which doctors use\\r\\nwhen they address a patient. â\\x80\\x98I am myself a medical manâ\\x80\\x99 (he did not\\r\\nsay â\\x80\\x98doctorâ\\x80\\x99), with which words he waved his hands towards the room and\\r\\nits contents as though in protest at his present condition. â\\x80\\x98I see that\\r\\nyouâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99m in consumption,â\\x80\\x99 I said laconically, rising from my seat.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe jumped up, too.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Perhaps you are exaggeratingâ\\x80\\x94if you were to take proper measures\\r\\nperhapsâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe was terribly confused and did not seem able to collect his\\r\\nscattered senses; the pocket-book was still in his left hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Oh, donâ\\x80\\x99t mind me,â\\x80\\x99 I said. â\\x80\\x98Dr. Bâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94 saw me last weekâ\\x80\\x99 (I lugged him\\r\\nin again), â\\x80\\x98and my hash is quite settled; pardon meâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x99 I took hold of\\r\\nthe door-handle again. I was on the point of opening the door and\\r\\nleaving my grateful but confused medical friend to himself and his\\r\\nshame, when my damnable cough got hold of me again.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy doctor insisted on my sitting down again to get my breath. He now\\r\\nsaid something to his wife who, without leaving her place, addressed a\\r\\nfew words of gratitude and courtesy to me. She seemed very shy over it,\\r\\nand her sickly face flushed up with confusion. I remained, but with the\\r\\nair of a man who knows he is intruding and is anxious to get away. The\\r\\ndoctorâ\\x80\\x99s remorse at last seemed to need a vent, I could see.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98If Iâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x99 he began, breaking off abruptly every other moment, and\\r\\nstarting another sentence. â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x94I am so very grateful to you, and I am so\\r\\nmuch to blame in your eyes, I feel sure, Iâ\\x80\\x94you seeâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x99 (he pointed to the\\r\\nroom again) â\\x80\\x98at this moment I am in such a positionâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Oh!â\\x80\\x99 I said, â\\x80\\x98thereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing to see; itâ\\x80\\x99s quite a clear caseâ\\x80\\x94youâ\\x80\\x99ve\\r\\nlost your post and have come up to make explanations and get another,\\r\\nif you can!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98How do you know that?â\\x80\\x99 he asked in amazement.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Oh, it was evident at the first glance,â\\x80\\x99 I said ironically, but not\\r\\nintentionally so. â\\x80\\x98There are lots of people who come up from the\\r\\nprovinces full of hope, and run about town, and have to live as best\\r\\nthey can.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe began to talk at once excitedly and with trembling lips; he began\\r\\ncomplaining and telling me his story. He interested me, I confess; I\\r\\nsat there nearly an hour. His story was a very ordinary one. He had\\r\\nbeen a provincial doctor; he had a civil appointment, and had no sooner\\r\\ntaken it up than intrigues began. Even his wife was dragged into these.\\r\\nHe was proud, and flew into a passion; there was a change of local\\r\\ngovernment which acted in favour of his opponents; his position was\\r\\nundermined, complaints were made against him; he lost his post and came\\r\\nup to Petersburg with his last remaining money, in order to appeal to\\r\\nhigher authorities. Of course nobody would listen to him for a long\\r\\ntime; he would come and tell his story one day and be refused promptly;\\r\\nanother day he would be fed on false promises; again he would be\\r\\ntreated harshly; then he would be told to sign some documents; then he\\r\\nwould sign the paper and hand it in, and they would refuse to receive\\r\\nit, and tell him to file a formal petition. In a word he had been\\r\\ndriven about from office to office for five months and had spent every\\r\\nfarthing he had; his wifeâ\\x80\\x99s last rags had just been pawned; and\\r\\nmeanwhile a child had been born to them andâ\\x80\\x94and today I have a final\\r\\nrefusal to my petition, and I have hardly a crumb of bread leftâ\\x80\\x94I have\\r\\nnothing left; my wife has had a baby latelyâ\\x80\\x94and Iâ\\x80\\x94Iâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe sprang up from his chair and turned away. His wife was crying in\\r\\nthe corner; the child had begun to moan again. I pulled out my\\r\\nnote-book and began writing in it. When I had finished and rose from my\\r\\nchair he was standing before me with an expression of alarmed\\r\\ncuriosity.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98I have jotted down your name,â\\x80\\x99 I told him, â\\x80\\x98and all the rest of\\r\\nitâ\\x80\\x94the place you served at, the district, the date, and all. I have a\\r\\nfriend, Bachmatoff, whose uncle is a councillor of state and has to do\\r\\nwith these matters, one Peter Matveyevitch Bachmatoff.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Peter Matveyevitch Bachmatoff!â\\x80\\x99 he cried, trembling all over with\\r\\nexcitement. â\\x80\\x98Why, nearly everything depends on that very man!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is very curious, this story of the medical man, and my visit, and\\r\\nthe happy termination to which I contributed by accident! Everything\\r\\nfitted in, as in a novel. I told the poor people not to put much hope\\r\\nin me, because I was but a poor schoolboy myselfâ\\x80\\x94(I am not really, but\\r\\nI humiliated myself as much as possible in order to make them less\\r\\nhopeful)â\\x80\\x94but that I would go at once to the Vassili Ostroff and see my\\r\\nfriend; and that as I knew for certain that his uncle adored him, and\\r\\nwas absolutely devoted to him as the last hope and branch of the\\r\\nfamily, perhaps the old man might do something to oblige his nephew.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98If only they would allow me to explain all to his excellency! If I\\r\\ncould but be permitted to tell my tale to him!â\\x80\\x9d he cried, trembling\\r\\nwith feverish agitation, and his eyes flashing with excitement. I\\r\\nrepeated once more that I could not hold out much hopeâ\\x80\\x94that it would\\r\\nprobably end in smoke, and if I did not turn up next morning they must\\r\\nmake up their minds that there was no more to be done in the matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey showed me out with bows and every kind of respect; they seemed\\r\\nquite beside themselves. I shall never forget the expression of their\\r\\nfaces!\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI took a droshky and drove over to the Vassili Ostroff at once. For\\r\\nsome years I had been at enmity with this young Bachmatoff, at school.\\r\\nWe considered him an aristocrat; at all events I called him one. He\\r\\nused to dress smartly, and always drove to school in a private trap. He\\r\\nwas a good companion, and was always merry and jolly, sometimes even\\r\\nwitty, though he was not very intellectual, in spite of the fact that\\r\\nhe was always top of the class; I myself was never top in anything! All\\r\\nhis companions were very fond of him, excepting myself. He had several\\r\\ntimes during those years come up to me and tried to make friends; but I\\r\\nhad always turned sulkily away and refused to have anything to do with\\r\\nhim. I had not seen him for a whole year now; he was at the university.\\r\\nWhen, at nine oâ\\x80\\x99clock, or so, this evening, I arrived and was shown up\\r\\nto him with great ceremony, he first received me with astonishment, and\\r\\nnot too affably, but he soon cheered up, and suddenly gazed intently at\\r\\nme and burst out laughing.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Why, what on earth can have possessed you to come and see _me_,\\r\\nTerentieff?â\\x80\\x99 he cried, with his usual pleasant, sometimes audacious,\\r\\nbut never offensive familiarity, which I liked in reality, but for\\r\\nwhich I also detested him. â\\x80\\x98Why whatâ\\x80\\x99s the matter?â\\x80\\x99 he cried in alarm.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Are you ill?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat confounded cough of mine had come on again; I fell into a chair,\\r\\nand with difficulty recovered my breath. â\\x80\\x98Itâ\\x80\\x99s all right, itâ\\x80\\x99s only\\r\\nconsumptionâ\\x80\\x99 I said. â\\x80\\x98I have come to you with a petition!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe sat down in amazement, and I lost no time in telling him the\\r\\nmedical manâ\\x80\\x99s history; and explained that he, with the influence which\\r\\nhe possessed over his uncle, might do some good to the poor fellow.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99ll do itâ\\x80\\x94Iâ\\x80\\x99ll do it, of course!â\\x80\\x99 he said. â\\x80\\x98I shall attack my uncle\\r\\nabout it tomorrow morning, and Iâ\\x80\\x99m very glad you told me the story. But\\r\\nhow was it that you thought of coming to me about it, Terentieff?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98So much depends upon your uncle,â\\x80\\x99 I said. â\\x80\\x98And besides we have always\\r\\nbeen enemies, Bachmatoff; and as you are a generous sort of fellow, I\\r\\nthought you would not refuse my request because I was your enemy!â\\x80\\x99 I\\r\\nadded with irony.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Like Napoleon going to England, eh?â\\x80\\x99 cried he, laughing. â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99ll do it\\r\\nthoughâ\\x80\\x94of course, and at once, if I can!â\\x80\\x99 he added, seeing that I rose\\r\\nseriously from my chair at this point.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd sure enough the matter ended as satisfactorily as possible. A\\r\\nmonth or so later my medical friend was appointed to another post. He\\r\\ngot his travelling expenses paid, and something to help him to start\\r\\nlife with once more. I think Bachmatoff must have persuaded the doctor\\r\\nto accept a loan from himself. I saw Bachmatoff two or three times,\\r\\nabout this period, the third time being when he gave a farewell dinner\\r\\nto the doctor and his wife before their departure, a champagne dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBachmatoff saw me home after the dinner and we crossed the Nicolai\\r\\nbridge. We were both a little drunk. He told me of his joy, the joyful\\r\\nfeeling of having done a good action; he said that it was all thanks to\\r\\nmyself that he could feel this satisfaction; and held forth about the\\r\\nfoolishness of the theory that individual charity is useless.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI, too, was burning to have my say!\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98In Moscow,â\\x80\\x99 I said, â\\x80\\x98there was an old state counsellor, a civil\\r\\ngeneral, who, all his life, had been in the habit of visiting the\\r\\nprisons and speaking to criminals. Every party of convicts on its way\\r\\nto Siberia knew beforehand that on the Vorobeef Hills the â\\x80\\x9cold generalâ\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nwould pay them a visit. He did all he undertook seriously and\\r\\ndevotedly. He would walk down the rows of the unfortunate prisoners,\\r\\nstop before each individual and ask after his needsâ\\x80\\x94he never sermonized\\r\\nthem; he spoke kindly to themâ\\x80\\x94he gave them money; he brought them all\\r\\nsorts of necessaries for the journey, and gave them devotional books,\\r\\nchoosing those who could read, under the firm conviction that they\\r\\nwould read to those who could not, as they went along.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98He scarcely ever talked about the particular crimes of any of them,\\r\\nbut listened if any volunteered information on that point. All the\\r\\nconvicts were equal for him, and he made no distinction. He spoke to\\r\\nall as to brothers, and every one of them looked upon him as a father.\\r\\nWhen he observed among the exiles some poor woman with a child, he\\r\\nwould always come forward and fondle the little one, and make it laugh.\\r\\nHe continued these acts of mercy up to his very death; and by that time\\r\\nall the criminals, all over Russia and Siberia, knew him!\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98A man I knew who had been to Siberia and returned, told me that he\\r\\nhimself had been a witness of how the very most hardened criminals\\r\\nremembered the old general, though, in point of fact, he could never,\\r\\nof course, have distributed more than a few pence to each member of a\\r\\nparty. Their recollection of him was not sentimental or particularly\\r\\ndevoted. Some wretch, for instance, who had been a murdererâ\\x80\\x94cutting the\\r\\nthroat of a dozen fellow-creatures, for instance; or stabbing six\\r\\nlittle children for his own amusement (there have been such men!)â\\x80\\x94would\\r\\nperhaps, without rhyme or reason, suddenly give a sigh and say, â\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nwonder whether that old general is alive still!â\\x80\\x9d Although perhaps he\\r\\nhad not thought of mentioning him for a dozen years before! How can one\\r\\nsay what seed of good may have been dropped into his soul, never to\\r\\ndie?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI continued in that strain for a long while, pointing out to\\r\\nBachmatoff how impossible it is to follow up the effects of any\\r\\nisolated good deed one may do, in all its influences and subtle\\r\\nworkings upon the heart and after-actions of others.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98And to think that you are to be cut off from life!â\\x80\\x99 remarked\\r\\nBachmatoff, in a tone of reproach, as though he would like to find\\r\\nsomeone to pitch into on my account.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe were leaning over the balustrade of the bridge, looking into the\\r\\nNeva at this moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Do you know what has suddenly come into my head?â\\x80\\x99 said I,\\r\\nsuddenlyâ\\x80\\x94leaning further and further over the rail.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Surely not to throw yourself into the river?â\\x80\\x99 cried Bachmatoff in\\r\\nalarm. Perhaps he read my thought in my face.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98No, not yet. At present nothing but the following consideration. You\\r\\nsee I have some two or three months left me to liveâ\\x80\\x94perhaps four; well,\\r\\nsupposing that when I have but a month or two more, I take a fancy for\\r\\nsome â\\x80\\x9cgood deedâ\\x80\\x9d that needs both trouble and time, like this business\\r\\nof our doctor friend, for instance: why, I shall have to give up the\\r\\nidea of it and take to something elseâ\\x80\\x94some _little_ good deed, _more\\r\\nwithin my means_, eh? Isnâ\\x80\\x99t that an amusing idea!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPoor Bachmatoff was much impressedâ\\x80\\x94painfully so. He took me all the\\r\\nway home; not attempting to console me, but behaving with the greatest\\r\\ndelicacy. On taking leave he pressed my hand warmly and asked\\r\\npermission to come and see me. I replied that if he came to me as a\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98comforter,â\\x80\\x99 so to speak (for he would be in that capacity whether he\\r\\nspoke to me in a soothing manner or only kept silence, as I pointed out\\r\\nto him), he would but remind me each time of my approaching death! He\\r\\nshrugged his shoulders, but quite agreed with me; and we parted better\\r\\nfriends than I had expected.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut that evening and that night were sown the first seeds of my â\\x80\\x98last\\r\\nconviction.â\\x80\\x99 I seized greedily on my new idea; I thirstily drank in all\\r\\nits different aspects (I did not sleep a wink that night!), and the\\r\\ndeeper I went into it the more my being seemed to merge itself in it,\\r\\nand the more alarmed I became. A dreadful terror came over me at last,\\r\\nand did not leave me all next day.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSometimes, thinking over this, I became quite numb with the terror of\\r\\nit; and I might well have deduced from this fact, that my â\\x80\\x98last\\r\\nconvictionâ\\x80\\x99 was eating into my being too fast and too seriously, and\\r\\nwould undoubtedly come to its climax before long. And for the climax I\\r\\nneeded greater determination than I yet possessed.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHowever, within three weeks my determination was taken, owing to a\\r\\nvery strange circumstance.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHere on my paper, I make a note of all the figures and dates that come\\r\\ninto my explanation. Of course, it is all the same to me, but just\\r\\nnowâ\\x80\\x94and perhaps only at this momentâ\\x80\\x94I desire that all those who are to\\r\\njudge of my action should see clearly out of how logical a sequence of\\r\\ndeductions has at length proceeded my â\\x80\\x98last conviction.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have said above that the determination needed by me for the\\r\\naccomplishment of my final resolve, came to hand not through any\\r\\nsequence of causes, but thanks to a certain strange circumstance which\\r\\nhad perhaps no connection whatever with the matter at issue. Ten days\\r\\nago Rogojin called upon me about certain business of his own with which\\r\\nI have nothing to do at present. I had never seen Rogojin before, but\\r\\nhad often heard about him.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI gave him all the information he needed, and he very soon took his\\r\\ndeparture; so that, since he only came for the purpose of gaining the\\r\\ninformation, the matter might have been expected to end there.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut he interested me too much, and all that day I was under the\\r\\ninfluence of strange thoughts connected with him, and I determined to\\r\\nreturn his visit the next day.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cRogojin was evidently by no means pleased to see me, and hinted,\\r\\ndelicately, that he saw no reason why our acquaintance should continue.\\r\\nFor all that, however, I spent a very interesting hour, and so, I dare\\r\\nsay, did he. There was so great a contrast between us that I am sure we\\r\\nmust both have felt it; anyhow, I felt it acutely. Here was I, with my\\r\\ndays numbered, and he, a man in the full vigour of life, living in the\\r\\npresent, without the slightest thought for â\\x80\\x98final convictions,â\\x80\\x99 or\\r\\nnumbers, or days, or, in fact, for anything but that which-whichâ\\x80\\x94well,\\r\\nwhich he was mad about, if he will excuse me the expressionâ\\x80\\x94as a feeble\\r\\nauthor who cannot express his ideas properly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn spite of his lack of amiability, I could not help seeing, in\\r\\nRogojin a man of intellect and sense; and although, perhaps, there was\\r\\nlittle in the outside world which was of interest to him, still he was\\r\\nclearly a man with eyes to see.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI hinted nothing to him about my â\\x80\\x98final conviction,â\\x80\\x99 but it appeared\\r\\nto me that he had guessed it from my words. He remained silentâ\\x80\\x94he is a\\r\\nterribly silent man. I remarked to him, as I rose to depart, that, in\\r\\nspite of the contrast and the wide differences between us two, les\\r\\nextremites se touchent (â\\x80\\x98extremes meet,â\\x80\\x99 as I explained to him in\\r\\nRussian); so that maybe he was not so far from my final conviction as\\r\\nappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHis only reply to this was a sour grimace. He rose and looked for my\\r\\ncap, and placed it in my hand, and led me out of the houseâ\\x80\\x94that\\r\\ndreadful gloomy house of hisâ\\x80\\x94to all appearances, of course, as though I\\r\\nwere leaving of my own accord, and he were simply seeing me to the door\\r\\nout of politeness. His house impressed me much; it is like a\\r\\nburial-ground, he seems to like it, which is, however, quite natural.\\r\\nSuch a full life as he leads is so overflowing with absorbing interests\\r\\nthat he has little need of assistance from his surroundings.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe visit to Rogojin exhausted me terribly. Besides, I had felt ill\\r\\nsince the morning; and by evening I was so weak that I took to my bed,\\r\\nand was in high fever at intervals, and even delirious. Colia sat with\\r\\nme until eleven oâ\\x80\\x99clock.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYet I remember all he talked about, and every word we said, though\\r\\nwhenever my eyes closed for a moment I could picture nothing but the\\r\\nimage of Surikoff just in the act of finding a million roubles. He\\r\\ncould not make up his mind what to do with the money, and tore his hair\\r\\nover it. He trembled with fear that somebody would rob him, and at last\\r\\nhe decided to bury it in the ground. I persuaded him that, instead of\\r\\nputting it all away uselessly underground, he had better melt it down\\r\\nand make a golden coffin out of it for his starved child, and then dig\\r\\nup the little one and put her into the golden coffin. Surikoff accepted\\r\\nthis suggestion, I thought, with tears of gratitude, and immediately\\r\\ncommenced to carry out my design.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI thought I spat on the ground and left him in disgust. Colia told me,\\r\\nwhen I quite recovered my senses, that I had not been asleep for a\\r\\nmoment, but that I had spoken to him about Surikoff the whole while.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAt moments I was in a state of dreadful weakness and misery, so that\\r\\nColia was greatly disturbed when he left me.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen I arose to lock the door after him, I suddenly called to mind a\\r\\npicture I had noticed at Rogojinâ\\x80\\x99s in one of his gloomiest rooms, over\\r\\nthe door. He had pointed it out to me himself as we walked past it, and\\r\\nI believe I must have stood a good five minutes in front of it. There\\r\\nwas nothing artistic about it, but the picture made me feel strangely\\r\\nuncomfortable. It represented Christ just taken down from the cross. It\\r\\nseems to me that painters as a rule represent the Saviour, both on the\\r\\ncross and taken down from it, with great beauty still upon His face.\\r\\nThis marvellous beauty they strive to preserve even in His moments of\\r\\ndeepest agony and passion. But there was no such beauty in Rogojinâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\npicture. This was the presentment of a poor mangled body which had\\r\\nevidently suffered unbearable anguish even before its crucifixion, full\\r\\nof wounds and bruises, marks of the violence of soldiers and people,\\r\\nand of the bitterness of the moment when He had fallen with the\\r\\ncrossâ\\x80\\x94all this combined with the anguish of the actual crucifixion.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe face was depicted as though still suffering; as though the body,\\r\\nonly just dead, was still almost quivering with agony. The picture was\\r\\none of pure nature, for the face was not beautified by the artist, but\\r\\nwas left as it would naturally be, whosoever the sufferer, after such\\r\\nanguish.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know that the earliest Christian faith taught that the Saviour\\r\\nsuffered actually and not figuratively, and that nature was allowed her\\r\\nown way even while His body was on the cross.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is strange to look on this dreadful picture of the mangled corpse\\r\\nof the Saviour, and to put this question to oneself: â\\x80\\x98Supposing that\\r\\nthe disciples, the future apostles, the women who had followed Him and\\r\\nstood by the cross, all of whom believed in and worshipped\\r\\nHimâ\\x80\\x94supposing that they saw this tortured body, this face so mangled\\r\\nand bleeding and bruised (and they _must_ have so seen it)â\\x80\\x94how could\\r\\nthey have gazed upon the dreadful sight and yet have believed that He\\r\\nwould rise again?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe thought steps in, whether one likes it or no, that death is so\\r\\nterrible and so powerful, that even He who conquered it in His miracles\\r\\nduring life was unable to triumph over it at the last. He who called to\\r\\nLazarus, â\\x80\\x98Lazarus, come forth!â\\x80\\x99 and the dead man livedâ\\x80\\x94He was now\\r\\nHimself a prey to nature and death. Nature appears to one, looking at\\r\\nthis picture, as some huge, implacable, dumb monster; or still betterâ\\x80\\x94a\\r\\nstranger simileâ\\x80\\x94some enormous mechanical engine of modern days which\\r\\nhas seized and crushed and swallowed up a great and invaluable Being, a\\r\\nBeing worth nature and all her laws, worth the whole earth, which was\\r\\nperhaps created merely for the sake of the advent of that Being.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis blind, dumb, implacable, eternal, unreasoning force is well shown\\r\\nin the picture, and the absolute subordination of all men and things to\\r\\nit is so well expressed that the idea unconsciously arises in the mind\\r\\nof anyone who looks at it. All those faithful people who were gazing at\\r\\nthe cross and its mutilated occupant must have suffered agony of mind\\r\\nthat evening; for they must have felt that all their hopes and almost\\r\\nall their faith had been shattered at a blow. They must have separated\\r\\nin terror and dread that night, though each perhaps carried away with\\r\\nhim one great thought which was never eradicated from his mind for ever\\r\\nafterwards. If this great Teacher of theirs could have seen Himself\\r\\nafter the Crucifixion, how could He have consented to mount the Cross\\r\\nand to die as He did? This thought also comes into the mind of the man\\r\\nwho gazes at this picture. I thought of all this by snatches probably\\r\\nbetween my attacks of deliriumâ\\x80\\x94for an hour and a half or so before\\r\\nColiaâ\\x80\\x99s departure.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCan there be an appearance of that which has no form? And yet it\\r\\nseemed to me, at certain moments, that I beheld in some strange and\\r\\nimpossible form, that dark, dumb, irresistibly powerful, eternal force.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI thought someone led me by the hand and showed me, by the light of a\\r\\ncandle, a huge, loathsome insect, which he assured me was that very\\r\\nforce, that very almighty, dumb, irresistible Power, and laughed at the\\r\\nindignation with which I received this information. In my room they\\r\\nalways light the little lamp before my icon for the night; it gives a\\r\\nfeeble flicker of light, but it is strong enough to see by dimly, and\\r\\nif you sit just under it you can even read by it. I think it was about\\r\\ntwelve or a little past that night. I had not slept a wink, and was\\r\\nlying with my eyes wide open, when suddenly the door opened, and in\\r\\ncame Rogojin.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe entered, and shut the door behind him. Then he silently gazed at me\\r\\nand went quickly to the corner of the room where the lamp was burning\\r\\nand sat down underneath it.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was much surprised, and looked at him expectantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cRogojin only leaned his elbow on the table and silently stared at me.\\r\\nSo passed two or three minutes, and I recollect that his silence hurt\\r\\nand offended me very much. Why did he not speak?\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat his arrival at this time of night struck me as more or less\\r\\nstrange may possibly be the case; but I remember I was by no means\\r\\namazed at it. On the contrary, though I had not actually told him my\\r\\nthought in the morning, yet I know he understood it; and this thought\\r\\nwas of such a character that it would not be anything very remarkable,\\r\\nif one were to come for further talk about it at any hour of night,\\r\\nhowever late.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI thought he must have come for this purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn the morning we had parted not the best of friends; I remember he\\r\\nlooked at me with disagreeable sarcasm once or twice; and this same\\r\\nlook I observed in his eyes nowâ\\x80\\x94which was the cause of the annoyance I\\r\\nfelt.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI did not for a moment suspect that I was delirious and that this\\r\\nRogojin was but the result of fever and excitement. I had not the\\r\\nslightest idea of such a theory at first.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMeanwhile he continued to sit and stare jeeringly at me.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI angrily turned round in bed and made up my mind that I would not say\\r\\na word unless he did; so I rested silently on my pillow determined to\\r\\nremain dumb, if it were to last till morning. I felt resolved that he\\r\\nshould speak first. Probably twenty minutes or so passed in this way.\\r\\nSuddenly the idea struck meâ\\x80\\x94what if this is an apparition and not\\r\\nRogojin himself?\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNeither during my illness nor at any previous time had I ever seen an\\r\\napparition;â\\x80\\x94but I had always thought, both when I was a little boy, and\\r\\neven now, that if I were to see one I should die on the spotâ\\x80\\x94though I\\r\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t believe in ghosts. And yet _now_, when the idea struck me that\\r\\nthis was a ghost and not Rogojin at all, I was not in the least\\r\\nalarmed. Nayâ\\x80\\x94the thought actually irritated me. Strangely enough, the\\r\\ndecision of the question as to whether this were a ghost or Rogojin did\\r\\nnot, for some reason or other, interest me nearly so much as it ought\\r\\nto have done;â\\x80\\x94I think I began to muse about something altogether\\r\\ndifferent. For instance, I began to wonder why Rogojin, who had been in\\r\\ndressing-gown and slippers when I saw him at home, had now put on a\\r\\ndress-coat and white waistcoat and tie? I also thought to myself, I\\r\\nrememberâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98if this is a ghost, and I am not afraid of it, why donâ\\x80\\x99t I\\r\\napproach it and verify my suspicions? Perhaps I am afraidâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x99 And no\\r\\nsooner did this last idea enter my head than an icy blast blew over me;\\r\\nI felt a chill down my backbone and my knees shook.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAt this very moment, as though divining my thoughts, Rogojin raised\\r\\nhis head from his arm and began to part his lips as though he were\\r\\ngoing to laughâ\\x80\\x94but he continued to stare at me as persistently as\\r\\nbefore.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI felt so furious with him at this moment that I longed to rush at\\r\\nhim; but as I had sworn that he should speak first, I continued to lie\\r\\nstillâ\\x80\\x94and the more willingly, as I was still by no means satisfied as\\r\\nto whether it really was Rogojin or not.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI cannot remember how long this lasted; I cannot recollect, either,\\r\\nwhether consciousness forsook me at intervals, or not. But at last\\r\\nRogojin rose, staring at me as intently as ever, but not smiling any\\r\\nlonger,â\\x80\\x94and walking very softly, almost on tip-toes, to the door, he\\r\\nopened it, went out, and shut it behind him.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI did not rise from my bed, and I donâ\\x80\\x99t know how long I lay with my\\r\\neyes open, thinking. I donâ\\x80\\x99t know what I thought about, nor how I fell\\r\\nasleep or became insensible; but I awoke next morning after nine\\r\\noâ\\x80\\x99clock when they knocked at my door. My general orders are that if I\\r\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t open the door and call, by nine oâ\\x80\\x99clock, Matreona is to come and\\r\\nbring my tea. When I now opened the door to her, the thought suddenly\\r\\nstruck meâ\\x80\\x94how could he have come in, since the door was locked? I made\\r\\ninquiries and found that Rogojin himself could not possibly have come\\r\\nin, because all our doors were locked for the night.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, this strange circumstanceâ\\x80\\x94which I have described with so much\\r\\ndetailâ\\x80\\x94was the ultimate cause which led me to taking my final\\r\\ndetermination. So that no logic, or logical deductions, had anything to\\r\\ndo with my resolve;â\\x80\\x94it was simply a matter of disgust.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was impossible for me to go on living when life was full of such\\r\\ndetestable, strange, tormenting forms. This ghost had humiliated\\r\\nme;â\\x80\\x94nor could I bear to be subordinate to that dark, horrible force\\r\\nwhich was embodied in the form of the loathsome insect. It was only\\r\\ntowards evening, when I had quite made up my mind on this point, that I\\r\\nbegan to feel easier.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nVII.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI had a small pocket pistol. I had procured it while still a boy, at\\r\\nthat droll age when the stories of duels and highwaymen begin to\\r\\ndelight one, and when one imagines oneself nobly standing fire at some\\r\\nfuture day, in a duel.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere were a couple of old bullets in the bag which contained the\\r\\npistol, and powder enough in an old flask for two or three charges.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe pistol was a wretched thing, very crooked and wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t carry\\r\\nfarther than fifteen paces at the most. However, it would send your\\r\\nskull flying well enough if you pressed the muzzle of it against your\\r\\ntemple.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI determined to die at Pavlofsk at sunrise, in the parkâ\\x80\\x94so as to make\\r\\nno commotion in the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis â\\x80\\x98explanationâ\\x80\\x99 will make the matter clear enough to the police.\\r\\nStudents of psychology, and anyone else who likes, may make what they\\r\\nplease of it. I should not like this paper, however, to be made public.\\r\\nI request the prince to keep a copy himself, and to give a copy to\\r\\nAglaya Ivanovna Epanchin. This is my last will and testament. As for my\\r\\nskeleton, I bequeath it to the Medical Academy for the benefit of\\r\\nscience.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI recognize no jurisdiction over myself, and I know that I am now\\r\\nbeyond the power of laws and judges.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA little while ago a very amusing idea struck me. What if I were now\\r\\nto commit some terrible crimeâ\\x80\\x94murder ten fellow-creatures, for\\r\\ninstance, or anything else that is thought most shocking and dreadful\\r\\nin this worldâ\\x80\\x94what a dilemma my judges would be in, with a criminal who\\r\\nonly has a fortnight to live in any case, now that the rack and other\\r\\nforms of torture are abolished! Why, I should die comfortably in their\\r\\nown hospitalâ\\x80\\x94in a warm, clean room, with an attentive doctorâ\\x80\\x94probably\\r\\nmuch more comfortably than I should at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t understand why people in my position do not oftener indulge in\\r\\nsuch ideasâ\\x80\\x94if only for a joke! Perhaps they do! Who knows! There are\\r\\nplenty of merry souls among us!\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut though I do not recognize any jurisdiction over myself, still I\\r\\nknow that I shall be judged, when I am nothing but a voiceless lump of\\r\\nclay; therefore I do not wish to go before I have left a word of\\r\\nreplyâ\\x80\\x94the reply of a free manâ\\x80\\x94not one forced to justify himselfâ\\x80\\x94oh no!\\r\\nI have no need to ask forgiveness of anyone. I wish to say a word\\r\\nmerely because I happen to desire it of my own free will.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHere, in the first place, comes a strange thought!\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWho, in the name of what Law, would think of disputing my full\\r\\npersonal right over the fortnight of life left to me? What jurisdiction\\r\\ncan be brought to bear upon the case? Who would wish me, not only to be\\r\\nsentenced, but to endure the sentence to the end? Surely there exists\\r\\nno man who would wish such a thingâ\\x80\\x94why should anyone desire it? For the\\r\\nsake of morality? Well, I can understand that if I were to make an\\r\\nattempt upon my own life while in the enjoyment of full health and\\r\\nvigourâ\\x80\\x94my life which might have been â\\x80\\x98useful,â\\x80\\x99 etc., etc.â\\x80\\x94morality\\r\\nmight reproach me, according to the old routine, for disposing of my\\r\\nlife without permissionâ\\x80\\x94or whatever its tenet may be. But now, _now_,\\r\\nwhen my sentence is out and my days numbered! How can morality have\\r\\nneed of my last breaths, and why should I die listening to the\\r\\nconsolations offered by the prince, who, without doubt, would not omit\\r\\nto demonstrate that death is actually a benefactor to me? (Christians\\r\\nlike him always end up with thatâ\\x80\\x94it is their pet theory.) And what do\\r\\nthey want with their ridiculous â\\x80\\x98Pavlofsk treesâ\\x80\\x99? To sweeten my last\\r\\nhours? Cannot they understand that the more I forget myself, the more I\\r\\nlet myself become attached to these last illusions of life and love, by\\r\\nmeans of which they try to hide from me Meyerâ\\x80\\x99s wall, and all that is\\r\\nso plainly written on itâ\\x80\\x94the more unhappy they make me? What is the use\\r\\nof all your nature to meâ\\x80\\x94all your parks and trees, your sunsets and\\r\\nsunrises, your blue skies and your self-satisfied facesâ\\x80\\x94when all this\\r\\nwealth of beauty and happiness begins with the fact that it accounts\\r\\nmeâ\\x80\\x94only meâ\\x80\\x94one too many! What is the good of all this beauty and glory\\r\\nto me, when every second, every moment, I cannot but be aware that this\\r\\nlittle fly which buzzes around my head in the sunâ\\x80\\x99s raysâ\\x80\\x94even this\\r\\nlittle fly is a sharer and participator in all the glory of the\\r\\nuniverse, and knows its place and is happy in it;â\\x80\\x94while Iâ\\x80\\x94only I, am an\\r\\noutcast, and have been blind to the fact hitherto, thanks to my\\r\\nsimplicity! Oh! I know well how the prince and others would like me,\\r\\ninstead of indulging in all these wicked words of my own, to sing, to\\r\\nthe glory and triumph of morality, that well-known verse of Gilbertâ\\x80\\x99s:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98O, puissent voir longtemps votre beautÃ© sacrÃ©e\\r\\nTant dâ\\x80\\x99amis, sourds Ã\\xa0 mes adieux!\\r\\nQuâ\\x80\\x99ils meurent pleins de jours, que leur mort soit pleurÃ©e,\\r\\nQuâ\\x80\\x99un ami leur ferme les yeux!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut believe me, believe me, my simple-hearted friends, that in this\\r\\nhighly moral verse, in this academical blessing to the world in general\\r\\nin the French language, is hidden the intensest gall and bitterness;\\r\\nbut so well concealed is the venom, that I dare say the poet actually\\r\\npersuaded himself that his words were full of the tears of pardon and\\r\\npeace, instead of the bitterness of disappointment and malice, and so\\r\\ndied in the delusion.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you know there is a limit of ignominy, beyond which manâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nconsciousness of shame cannot go, and after which begins satisfaction\\r\\nin shame? Well, of course humility is a great force in that sense, I\\r\\nadmit thatâ\\x80\\x94though not in the sense in which religion accounts humility\\r\\nto be strength!\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cReligion!â\\x80\\x94I admit eternal lifeâ\\x80\\x94and perhaps I always did admit it.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAdmitted that consciousness is called into existence by the will of a\\r\\nHigher Power; admitted that this consciousness looks out upon the world\\r\\nand says â\\x80\\x98I am;â\\x80\\x99 and admitted that the Higher Power wills that the\\r\\nconsciousness so called into existence, be suddenly extinguished (for\\r\\nsoâ\\x80\\x94for some unexplained reasonâ\\x80\\x94it is and must be)â\\x80\\x94still there comes the\\r\\neternal questionâ\\x80\\x94why must I be humble through all this? Is it not\\r\\nenough that I am devoured, without my being expected to bless the power\\r\\nthat devours me? Surelyâ\\x80\\x94surely I need not suppose that\\r\\nSomebodyâ\\x80\\x94thereâ\\x80\\x94will be offended because I do not wish to live out the\\r\\nfortnight allowed me? I donâ\\x80\\x99t believe it.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is much simpler, and far more likely, to believe that my death is\\r\\nneededâ\\x80\\x94the death of an insignificant atomâ\\x80\\x94in order to fulfil the\\r\\ngeneral harmony of the universeâ\\x80\\x94in order to make even some plus or\\r\\nminus in the sum of existence. Just as every day the death of numbers\\r\\nof beings is necessary because without their annihilation the rest\\r\\ncannot live onâ\\x80\\x94(although we must admit that the idea is not a\\r\\nparticularly grand one in itself!)\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHoweverâ\\x80\\x94admit the fact! Admit that without such perpetual devouring of\\r\\none another the world cannot continue to exist, or could never have\\r\\nbeen organizedâ\\x80\\x94I am ever ready to confess that I cannot understand why\\r\\nthis is soâ\\x80\\x94but Iâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you what I _do_ know, for certain. If I have\\r\\nonce been given to understand and realize that I _am_â\\x80\\x94what does it\\r\\nmatter to me that the world is organized on a system full of errors and\\r\\nthat otherwise it cannot be organized at all? Who will or can judge me\\r\\nafter this? Say what you likeâ\\x80\\x94the thing is impossible and unjust!\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd meanwhile I have never been able, in spite of my great desire to\\r\\ndo so, to persuade myself that there is no future existence, and no\\r\\nProvidence.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe fact of the matter is that all this _does_ exist, but that we know\\r\\nabsolutely nothing about the future life and its laws!\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut it is so difficult, and even impossible to understand, that surely\\r\\nI am not to be blamed because I could not fathom the incomprehensible?\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course I know they say that one must be obedient, and of course,\\r\\ntoo, the prince is one of those who say so: that one must be obedient\\r\\nwithout questions, out of pure goodness of heart, and that for my\\r\\nworthy conduct in this matter I shall meet with reward in another\\r\\nworld. We degrade God when we attribute our own ideas to Him, out of\\r\\nannoyance that we cannot fathom His ways.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAgain, I repeat, I cannot be blamed because I am unable to understand\\r\\nthat which it is not given to mankind to fathom. Why am I to be judged\\r\\nbecause I could not comprehend the Will and Laws of Providence? No, we\\r\\nhad better drop religion.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd enough of this. By the time I have got so far in the reading of my\\r\\ndocument the sun will be up and the huge force of his rays will be\\r\\nacting upon the living world. So be it. I shall die gazing straight at\\r\\nthe great Fountain of life and power; I do not want this life!\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf I had had the power to prevent my own birth I should certainly\\r\\nnever have consented to accept existence under such ridiculous\\r\\nconditions. However, I have the power to end my existence, although I\\r\\ndo but give back days that are already numbered. It is an insignificant\\r\\ngift, and my revolt is equally insignificant.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFinal explanation: I die, not in the least because I am unable to\\r\\nsupport these next three weeks. Oh no, I should find strength enough,\\r\\nand if I wished it I could obtain consolation from the thought of the\\r\\ninjury that is done me. But I am not a French poet, and I do not desire\\r\\nsuch consolation. And finally, nature has so limited my capacity for\\r\\nwork or activity of any kind, in allotting me but three weeks of time,\\r\\nthat suicide is about the only thing left that I can begin and end in\\r\\nthe time of my own free will.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPerhaps then I am anxious to take advantage of my last chance of doing\\r\\nsomething for myself. A protest is sometimes no small thing.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe explanation was finished; Hippolyte paused at last.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is, in extreme cases, a final stage of cynical candour when a\\r\\nnervous man, excited, and beside himself with emotion, will be afraid\\r\\nof nothing and ready for any sort of scandal, nay, glad of it. The\\r\\nextraordinary, almost unnatural, tension of the nerves which upheld\\r\\nHippolyte up to this point, had now arrived at this final stage. This\\r\\npoor feeble boy of eighteenâ\\x80\\x94exhausted by diseaseâ\\x80\\x94looked for all the\\r\\nworld as weak and frail as a leaflet torn from its parent tree and\\r\\ntrembling in the breeze; but no sooner had his eye swept over his\\r\\naudience, for the first time during the whole of the last hour, than\\r\\nthe most contemptuous, the most haughty expression of repugnance\\r\\nlighted up his face. He defied them all, as it were. But his hearers\\r\\nwere indignant, too; they rose to their feet with annoyance. Fatigue,\\r\\nthe wine consumed, the strain of listening so long, all added to the\\r\\ndisagreeable impression which the reading had made upon them.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly Hippolyte jumped up as though he had been shot.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe sun is rising,â\\x80\\x9d he cried, seeing the gilded tops of the trees, and\\r\\npointing to them as to a miracle. â\\x80\\x9cSee, it is rising now!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, what then? Did you suppose it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t going to rise?â\\x80\\x9d asked\\r\\nFerdishenko.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s going to be atrociously hot again all day,â\\x80\\x9d said Gania, with an\\r\\nair of annoyance, taking his hat. â\\x80\\x9cA month of this... Are you coming\\r\\nhome, Ptitsin?â\\x80\\x9d Hippolyte listened to this in amazement, almost\\r\\namounting to stupefaction. Suddenly he became deadly pale and\\r\\nshuddered.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou manage your composure too awkwardly. I see you wish to insult me,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nhe cried to Gania. â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x94you are a cur!â\\x80\\x9d He looked at Gania with an\\r\\nexpression of malice.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat on earth is the matter with the boy? What phenomenal\\r\\nfeeble-mindedness!â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Ferdishenko.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, heâ\\x80\\x99s simply a fool,â\\x80\\x9d said Gania.\\r\\n\\r\\nHippolyte braced himself up a little.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI understand, gentlemen,â\\x80\\x9d he began, trembling as before, and stumbling\\r\\nover every word, â\\x80\\x9cthat I have deserved your resentment, andâ\\x80\\x94and am\\r\\nsorry that I should have troubled you with this raving nonsenseâ\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n(pointing to his article), â\\x80\\x9cor rather, I am sorry that I have not\\r\\ntroubled you enough.â\\x80\\x9d He smiled feebly. â\\x80\\x9cHave I troubled you, Evgenie\\r\\nPavlovitch?â\\x80\\x9d He suddenly turned on Evgenie with this question. â\\x80\\x9cTell me\\r\\nnow, have I troubled you or not?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, it was a little drawn out, perhaps; butâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome, speak out! Donâ\\x80\\x99t lie, for once in your lifeâ\\x80\\x94speak out!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\ncontinued Hippolyte, quivering with agitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, my good sir, I assure you itâ\\x80\\x99s entirely the same to me. Please\\r\\nleave me in peace,â\\x80\\x9d said Evgenie, angrily, turning his back on him.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood-night, prince,â\\x80\\x9d said Ptitsin, approaching his host.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat are you thinking of? Donâ\\x80\\x99t go, heâ\\x80\\x99ll blow his brains out in a\\r\\nminute!â\\x80\\x9d cried Vera Lebedeff, rushing up to Hippolyte and catching hold\\r\\nof his hands in a torment of alarm. â\\x80\\x9cWhat are you thinking of? He said\\r\\nhe would blow his brains out at sunrise.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, he wonâ\\x80\\x99t shoot himself!â\\x80\\x9d cried several voices, sarcastically.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGentlemen, youâ\\x80\\x99d better look out,â\\x80\\x9d cried Colia, also seizing Hippolyte\\r\\nby the hand. â\\x80\\x9cJust look at him! Prince, what are you thinking of?â\\x80\\x9d Vera\\r\\nand Colia, and Keller, and Burdovsky were all crowding round Hippolyte\\r\\nnow and holding him down.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe has the rightâ\\x80\\x94the rightâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d murmured Burdovsky. â\\x80\\x9cExcuse me, prince,\\r\\nbut what are your arrangements?â\\x80\\x9d asked Lebedeff, tipsy and exasperated,\\r\\ngoing up to Muishkin.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean by â\\x80\\x98arrangementsâ\\x80\\x99?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, no, excuse me! Iâ\\x80\\x99m master of this house, though I do not wish to\\r\\nlack respect towards you. You are master of the house too, in a way;\\r\\nbut I canâ\\x80\\x99t allow this sort of thingâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe wonâ\\x80\\x99t shoot himself; the boy is only playing the fool,â\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nGeneral Ivolgin, suddenly and unexpectedly, with indignation.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know he wonâ\\x80\\x99t, I know he wonâ\\x80\\x99t, general; but Iâ\\x80\\x94Iâ\\x80\\x99m master here!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cListen, Mr. Terentieff,â\\x80\\x9d said Ptitsin, who had bidden the prince\\r\\ngood-night, and was now holding out his hand to Hippolyte; â\\x80\\x9cI think you\\r\\nremark in that manuscript of yours, that you bequeath your skeleton to\\r\\nthe Academy. Are you referring to your own skeletonâ\\x80\\x94I mean, your very\\r\\nbones?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, my bones, Iâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuite so, I see; because, you know, little mistakes have occurred now\\r\\nand then. There was a caseâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy do you tease him?â\\x80\\x9d cried the prince, suddenly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ve moved him to tears,â\\x80\\x9d added Ferdishenko. But Hippolyte was by no\\r\\nmeans weeping. He was about to move from his place, when his four\\r\\nguards rushed at him and seized him once more. There was a laugh at\\r\\nthis.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe led up to this on purpose. He took the trouble of writing all that\\r\\nso that people should come and grab him by the arm,â\\x80\\x9d observed Rogojin.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood-night, prince. What a time weâ\\x80\\x99ve sat here, my very bones ache!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf you really intended to shoot yourself, Terentieff,â\\x80\\x9d said Evgenie\\r\\nPavlovitch, laughing, â\\x80\\x9cif I were you, after all these compliments, I\\r\\nshould just not shoot myself in order to vex them all.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey are very anxious to see me blow my brains out,â\\x80\\x9d said Hippolyte,\\r\\nbitterly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, theyâ\\x80\\x99ll be awfully annoyed if they donâ\\x80\\x99t see it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen you think they wonâ\\x80\\x99t see it?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am not trying to egg you on. On the contrary, I think it very likely\\r\\nthat you may shoot yourself; but the principal thing is to keep cool,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nsaid Evgenie with a drawl, and with great condescension.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI only now perceive what a terrible mistake I made in reading this\\r\\narticle to them,â\\x80\\x9d said Hippolyte, suddenly, addressing Evgenie, and\\r\\nlooking at him with an expression of trust and confidence, as though he\\r\\nwere applying to a friend for counsel.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, itâ\\x80\\x99s a droll situation; I really donâ\\x80\\x99t know what advice to give\\r\\nyou,â\\x80\\x9d replied Evgenie, laughing. Hippolyte gazed steadfastly at him,\\r\\nbut said nothing. To look at him one might have supposed that he was\\r\\nunconscious at intervals.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExcuse me,â\\x80\\x9d said Lebedeff, â\\x80\\x9cbut did you observe the young gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nstyle? â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99ll go and blow my brains out in the park,â\\x80\\x99 says he, â\\x80\\x98so as\\r\\nnot to disturb anyone.â\\x80\\x99 He thinks he wonâ\\x80\\x99t disturb anybody if he goes\\r\\nthree yards away, into the park, and blows his brains out there.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGentlemenâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d began the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, no, excuse me, most revered prince,â\\x80\\x9d Lebedeff interrupted,\\r\\nexcitedly. â\\x80\\x9cSince you must have observed yourself that this is no joke,\\r\\nand since at least half your guests must also have concluded that after\\r\\nall that has been said this youth _must_ blow his brains out for\\r\\nhonourâ\\x80\\x99s sakeâ\\x80\\x94Iâ\\x80\\x94as master of this house, and before these witnesses,\\r\\nnow call upon you to take steps.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, but what am I to do, Lebedeff? What steps am I to take? I am\\r\\nready.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you. In the first place he must immediately deliver up the\\r\\npistol which he boasted of, with all its appurtenances. If he does this\\r\\nI shall consent to his being allowed to spend the night in this\\r\\nhouseâ\\x80\\x94considering his feeble state of health, and of course\\r\\nconditionally upon his being under proper supervision. But tomorrow he\\r\\nmust go elsewhere. Excuse me, prince! Should he refuse to deliver up\\r\\nhis weapon, then I shall instantly seize one of his arms and General\\r\\nIvolgin the other, and we shall hold him until the police arrive and\\r\\ntake the matter into their own hands. Mr. Ferdishenko will kindly fetch\\r\\nthem.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this there was a dreadful noise; Lebedeff danced about in his\\r\\nexcitement; Ferdishenko prepared to go for the police; Gania\\r\\nfrantically insisted that it was all nonsense, â\\x80\\x9cfor nobody was going to\\r\\nshoot themselves.â\\x80\\x9d Evgenie Pavlovitch said nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPrince,â\\x80\\x9d whispered Hippolyte, suddenly, his eyes all ablaze, â\\x80\\x9cyou\\r\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t suppose that I did not foresee all this hatred?â\\x80\\x9d He looked at the\\r\\nprince as though he expected him to reply, for a moment. â\\x80\\x9cEnough!â\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nadded at length, and addressing the whole company, he cried: â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s all\\r\\nmy fault, gentlemen! Lebedeff, hereâ\\x80\\x99s the key,â\\x80\\x9d (he took out a small\\r\\nbunch of keys); â\\x80\\x9cthis one, the last but oneâ\\x80\\x94Colia will show youâ\\x80\\x94Colia,\\r\\nwhereâ\\x80\\x99s Colia?â\\x80\\x9d he cried, looking straight at Colia and not seeing him.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, heâ\\x80\\x99ll show you; he packed the bag with me this morning. Take him\\r\\nup, Colia; my bag is upstairs in the princeâ\\x80\\x99s study, under the table.\\r\\nHereâ\\x80\\x99s the key, and in the little case youâ\\x80\\x99ll find my pistol and the\\r\\npowder, and all. Colia packed it himself, Mr. Lebedeff; heâ\\x80\\x99ll show you;\\r\\nbut itâ\\x80\\x99s on condition that tomorrow morning, when I leave for\\r\\nPetersburg, you will give me back my pistol, do you hear? I do this for\\r\\nthe princeâ\\x80\\x99s sake, not yours.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCapital, thatâ\\x80\\x99s much better!â\\x80\\x9d cried Lebedeff, and seizing the key he\\r\\nmade off in haste.\\r\\n\\r\\nColia stopped a moment as though he wished to say something; but\\r\\nLebedeff dragged him away.\\r\\n\\r\\nHippolyte looked around at the laughing guests. The prince observed\\r\\nthat his teeth were chattering as though in a violent attack of ague.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat brutes they all are!â\\x80\\x9d he whispered to the prince. Whenever he\\r\\naddressed him he lowered his voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLet them alone, youâ\\x80\\x99re too weak nowâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, directly; Iâ\\x80\\x99ll go away directly. Iâ\\x80\\x99llâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly he embraced Muishkin.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPerhaps you think I am mad, eh?â\\x80\\x9d he asked him, laughing very\\r\\nstrangely.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, but youâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDirectly, directly! Stand still a moment, I wish to look in your eyes;\\r\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t speakâ\\x80\\x94stand soâ\\x80\\x94let me look at you! I am bidding farewell to\\r\\nmankind.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stood so for ten seconds, gazing at the prince, motionless, deadly\\r\\npale, his temples wet with perspiration; he held the princeâ\\x80\\x99s hand in a\\r\\nstrange grip, as though afraid to let him go.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHippolyte, Hippolyte, what is the matter with you?â\\x80\\x9d cried Muishkin.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDirectly! There, thatâ\\x80\\x99s enough. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll lie down directly. I must drink\\r\\nto the sunâ\\x80\\x99s health. I wish toâ\\x80\\x94I insist upon it! Let go!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe seized a glass from the table, broke away from the prince, and in a\\r\\nmoment had reached the terrace steps.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince made after him, but it so happened that at this moment\\r\\nEvgenie Pavlovitch stretched out his hand to say good-night. The next\\r\\ninstant there was a general outcry, and then followed a few moments of\\r\\nindescribable excitement.\\r\\n\\r\\nReaching the steps, Hippolyte had paused, holding the glass in his left\\r\\nhand while he put his right hand into his coat pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\nKeller insisted afterwards that he had held his right hand in his\\r\\npocket all the while, when he was speaking to the prince, and that he\\r\\nhad held the latterâ\\x80\\x99s shoulder with his left hand only. This\\r\\ncircumstance, Keller affirmed, had led him to feel some suspicion from\\r\\nthe first. However this may be, Keller ran after Hippolyte, but he was\\r\\ntoo late.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe caught sight of something flashing in Hippolyteâ\\x80\\x99s right hand, and\\r\\nsaw that it was a pistol. He rushed at him, but at that very instant\\r\\nHippolyte raised the pistol to his temple and pulled the trigger. There\\r\\nfollowed a sharp metallic click, but no report.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Keller seized the would-be suicide, the latter fell forward into\\r\\nhis arms, probably actually believing that he was shot. Keller had hold\\r\\nof the pistol now. Hippolyte was immediately placed in a chair, while\\r\\nthe whole company thronged around excitedly, talking and asking each\\r\\nother questions. Every one of them had heard the snap of the trigger,\\r\\nand yet they saw a live and apparently unharmed man before them.\\r\\n\\r\\nHippolyte himself sat quite unconscious of what was going on, and gazed\\r\\naround with a senseless expression.\\r\\n\\r\\nLebedeff and Colia came rushing up at this moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat is it?â\\x80\\x9d someone asked, breathlesslyâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cA misfire?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPerhaps it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t loaded,â\\x80\\x9d said several voices.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s loaded all right,â\\x80\\x9d said Keller, examining the pistol, â\\x80\\x9cbutâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat! did it miss fire?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere was no cap in it,â\\x80\\x9d Keller announced.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would be difficult to describe the pitiable scene that now followed.\\r\\nThe first sensation of alarm soon gave place to amusement; some burst\\r\\nout laughing loud and heartily, and seemed to find a malicious\\r\\nsatisfaction in the joke. Poor Hippolyte sobbed hysterically; he wrung\\r\\nhis hands; he approached everyone in turnâ\\x80\\x94even Ferdishenkoâ\\x80\\x94and took\\r\\nthem by both hands, and swore solemnly that he had forgottenâ\\x80\\x94absolutely\\r\\nforgottenâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9caccidentally, and not on purpose,â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94to put a cap inâ\\x80\\x94that he\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9chad ten of them, at least, in his pocket.â\\x80\\x9d He pulled them out and\\r\\nshowed them to everyone; he protested that he had not liked to put one\\r\\nin beforehand for fear of an accidental explosion in his pocket. That\\r\\nhe had thought he would have lots of time to put it in afterwardsâ\\x80\\x94when\\r\\nrequiredâ\\x80\\x94and, that, in the heat of the moment, he had forgotten all\\r\\nabout it. He threw himself upon the prince, then on Evgenie Pavlovitch.\\r\\nHe entreated Keller to give him back the pistol, and heâ\\x80\\x99d soon show\\r\\nthem all that â\\x80\\x9chis honourâ\\x80\\x94his honour,â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94but he was â\\x80\\x9cdishonoured, now,\\r\\nfor ever!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe fell senseless at lastâ\\x80\\x94and was carried into the princeâ\\x80\\x99s study.\\r\\n\\r\\nLebedeff, now quite sobered down, sent for a doctor; and he and his\\r\\ndaughter, with Burdovsky and General Ivolgin, remained by the sick\\r\\nmanâ\\x80\\x99s couch.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he was carried away unconscious, Keller stood in the middle of the\\r\\nroom, and made the following declaration to the company in general, in\\r\\na loud tone of voice, with emphasis upon each word.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGentlemen, if any one of you casts any doubt again, before me, upon\\r\\nHippolyteâ\\x80\\x99s good faith, or hints that the cap was forgotten\\r\\nintentionally, or suggests that this unhappy boy was acting a part\\r\\nbefore us, I beg to announce that the person so speaking shall account\\r\\nto me for his words.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe company departed very quickly, in a mass. Ptitsin, Gania, and\\r\\nRogojin went away together.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince was much astonished that Evgenie Pavlovitch changed his\\r\\nmind, and took his departure without the conversation he had requested.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, you wished to have a talk with me when the others left?â\\x80\\x9d he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuite so,â\\x80\\x9d said Evgenie, sitting down suddenly beside him, â\\x80\\x9cbut I have\\r\\nchanged my mind for the time being. I confess, I am too disturbed, and\\r\\nso, I think, are you; and the matter as to which I wished to consult\\r\\nyou is too serious to tackle with oneâ\\x80\\x99s mind even a little disturbed;\\r\\ntoo serious both for myself and for you. You see, prince, for once in\\r\\nmy life I wish to perform an absolutely honest action, that is, an\\r\\naction with no ulterior motive; and I think I am hardly in a condition\\r\\nto talk of it just at this moment, andâ\\x80\\x94andâ\\x80\\x94well, weâ\\x80\\x99ll discuss it\\r\\nanother time. Perhaps the matter may gain in clearness if we wait for\\r\\ntwo or three daysâ\\x80\\x94just the two or three days which I must spend in\\r\\nPetersburg.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHere he rose again from his chair, so that it seemed strange that he\\r\\nshould have thought it worth while to sit down at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince thought, too, that he looked vexed and annoyed, and not\\r\\nnearly so friendly towards himself as he had been earlier in the night.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI suppose you will go to the suffererâ\\x80\\x99s bedside now?â\\x80\\x9d he added.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I am afraid...â\\x80\\x9d began the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, you neednâ\\x80\\x99t fear! Heâ\\x80\\x99ll live another six weeks all right. Very\\r\\nlikely he will recover altogether; but I strongly advise you to pack\\r\\nhim off tomorrow.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think I may have offended him by saying nothing just now. I am\\r\\nafraid he may suspect that I doubted his good faith,â\\x80\\x94about shooting\\r\\nhimself, you know. What do you think, Evgenie Pavlovitch?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot a bit of it! You are much too good to him; you shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t care a\\r\\nhang about what he thinks. I have heard of such things before, but\\r\\nnever came across, till tonight, a man who would actually shoot himself\\r\\nin order to gain a vulgar notoriety, or blow out his brains for spite,\\r\\nif he finds that people donâ\\x80\\x99t care to pat him on the back for his\\r\\nsanguinary intentions. But what astonishes me more than anything is the\\r\\nfellowâ\\x80\\x99s candid confession of weakness. Youâ\\x80\\x99d better get rid of him\\r\\ntomorrow, in any case.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you think he will make another attempt?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh no, not he, not now! But you have to be very careful with this sort\\r\\nof gentleman. Crime is too often the last resource of these petty\\r\\nnonentities. This young fellow is quite capable of cutting the throats\\r\\nof ten people, simply for a lark, as he told us in his â\\x80\\x98explanation.â\\x80\\x99 I\\r\\nassure you those confounded words of his will not let me sleep.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think you disturb yourself too much.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat an extraordinary person you are, prince! Do you mean to say that\\r\\nyou doubt the fact that he is capable of murdering ten men?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI darenâ\\x80\\x99t say, one way or the other; all this is very strangeâ\\x80\\x94butâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, as you like, just as you like,â\\x80\\x9d said Evgenie Pavlovitch,\\r\\nirritably. â\\x80\\x9cOnly you are such a plucky fellow, take care you donâ\\x80\\x99t get\\r\\nincluded among the ten victims!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, he is much more likely not to kill anyone at all,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\r\\nprince, gazing thoughtfully at Evgenie. The latter laughed\\r\\ndisagreeably.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, _au revoir!_ Did you observe that he â\\x80\\x98willedâ\\x80\\x99 a copy of his\\r\\nconfession to Aglaya Ivanovna?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I did; I am thinking of it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn connection with â\\x80\\x98the ten,â\\x80\\x99 eh?â\\x80\\x9d laughed Evgenie, as he left the\\r\\nroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn hour later, towards four oâ\\x80\\x99clock, the prince went into the park. He\\r\\nhad endeavoured to fall asleep, but could not, owing to the painful\\r\\nbeating of his heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had left things quiet and peaceful; the invalid was fast asleep, and\\r\\nthe doctor, who had been called in, had stated that there was no\\r\\nspecial danger. Lebedeff, Colia, and Burdovsky were lying down in the\\r\\nsick-room, ready to take it in turns to watch. There was nothing to\\r\\nfear, therefore, at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the princeâ\\x80\\x99s mental perturbation increased every moment. He\\r\\nwandered about the park, looking absently around him, and paused in\\r\\nastonishment when he suddenly found himself in the empty space with the\\r\\nrows of chairs round it, near the Vauxhall. The look of the place\\r\\nstruck him as dreadful now: so he turned round and went by the path\\r\\nwhich he had followed with the Epanchins on the way to the band, until\\r\\nhe reached the green bench which Aglaya had pointed out for their\\r\\nrendezvous. He sat down on it and suddenly burst into a loud fit of\\r\\nlaughter, immediately followed by a feeling of irritation. His\\r\\ndisturbance of mind continued; he felt that he must go away somewhere,\\r\\nanywhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbove his head some little bird sang out, of a sudden; he began to peer\\r\\nabout for it among the leaves. Suddenly the bird darted out of the tree\\r\\nand away, and instantly he thought of the â\\x80\\x9cfly buzzing about in the\\r\\nsunâ\\x80\\x99s raysâ\\x80\\x9d that Hippolyte had talked of; how that it knew its place\\r\\nand was a participator in the universal life, while he alone was an\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9coutcast.â\\x80\\x9d This picture had impressed him at the time, and he meditated\\r\\nupon it now. An old, forgotten memory awoke in his brain, and suddenly\\r\\nburst into clearness and light. It was a recollection of Switzerland,\\r\\nduring the first year of his cure, the very first months. At that time\\r\\nhe had been pretty nearly an idiot still; he could not speak properly,\\r\\nand had difficulty in understanding when others spoke to him. He\\r\\nclimbed the mountain-side, one sunny morning, and wandered long and\\r\\naimlessly with a certain thought in his brain, which would not become\\r\\nclear. Above him was the blazing sky, below, the lake; all around was\\r\\nthe horizon, clear and infinite. He looked out upon this, long and\\r\\nanxiously. He remembered how he had stretched out his arms towards the\\r\\nbeautiful, boundless blue of the horizon, and wept, and wept. What had\\r\\nso tormented him was the idea that he was a stranger to all this, that\\r\\nhe was outside this glorious festival.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat was this universe? What was this grand, eternal pageant to which\\r\\nhe had yearned from his childhood up, and in which he could never take\\r\\npart? Every morning the same magnificent sun; every morning the same\\r\\nrainbow in the waterfall; every evening the same glow on the\\r\\nsnow-mountains.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery little fly that buzzed in the sunâ\\x80\\x99s rays was a singer in the\\r\\nuniversal chorus, â\\x80\\x9cknew its place, and was happy in it.â\\x80\\x9d Every blade of\\r\\ngrass grew and was happy. Everything knew its path and loved it, went\\r\\nforth with a song and returned with a song; only he knew nothing,\\r\\nunderstood nothing, neither men nor words, nor any of natureâ\\x80\\x99s voices;\\r\\nhe was a stranger and an outcast.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, he could not then speak these words, or express all he felt! He had\\r\\nbeen tormented dumbly; but now it appeared to him that he must have\\r\\nsaid these very wordsâ\\x80\\x94even thenâ\\x80\\x94and that Hippolyte must have taken his\\r\\npicture of the little fly from his tears and words of that time.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was sure of it, and his heart beat excitedly at the thought, he knew\\r\\nnot why.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe fell asleep on the bench; but his mental disquiet continued through\\r\\nhis slumbers.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust before he dozed off, the idea of Hippolyte murdering ten men\\r\\nflitted through his brain, and he smiled at the absurdity of such a\\r\\nthought.\\r\\n\\r\\nAround him all was quiet; only the flutter and whisper of the leaves\\r\\nbroke the silence, but broke it only to cause it to appear yet more\\r\\ndeep and still.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe dreamed many dreams as he sat there, and all were full of disquiet,\\r\\nso that he shuddered every moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length a woman seemed to approach him. He knew her, oh! he knew her\\r\\nonly too well. He could always name her and recognize her anywhere;\\r\\nbut, strange, she seemed to have quite a different face from hers, as\\r\\nhe had known it, and he felt a tormenting desire to be able to say she\\r\\nwas not the same woman. In the face before him there was such dreadful\\r\\nremorse and horror that he thought she must be a criminal, that she\\r\\nmust have just committed some awful crime.\\r\\n\\r\\nTears were trembling on her white cheek. She beckoned him, but placed\\r\\nher finger on her lip as though to warn him that he must follow her\\r\\nvery quietly. His heart froze within him. He wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t, he _couldnâ\\x80\\x99t_\\r\\nconfess her to be a criminal, and yet he felt that something dreadful\\r\\nwould happen the next moment, something which would blast his whole\\r\\nlife.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe seemed to wish to show him something, not far off, in the park.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe rose from his seat in order to follow her, when a bright, clear peal\\r\\nof laughter rang out by his side. He felt somebodyâ\\x80\\x99s hand suddenly in\\r\\nhis own, seized it, pressed it hard, and awoke. Before him stood\\r\\nAglaya, laughing aloud.\\r\\n\\r\\nVIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe laughed, but she was rather angry too.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s asleep! You were asleep,â\\x80\\x9d she said, with contemptuous surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs it really you?â\\x80\\x9d muttered the prince, not quite himself as yet, and\\r\\nrecognizing her with a start of amazement. â\\x80\\x9cOh yes, of course,â\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nadded, â\\x80\\x9cthis is our rendezvous. I fell asleep here.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo I saw.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDid no one awake me besides yourself? Was there no one else here? I\\r\\nthought there was another woman.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere was another woman here?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last he was wide awake.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was a dream, of course,â\\x80\\x9d he said, musingly. â\\x80\\x9cStrange that I should\\r\\nhave a dream like that at such a moment. Sit downâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took her hand and seated her on the bench; then sat down beside her\\r\\nand reflected.\\r\\n\\r\\nAglaya did not begin the conversation, but contented herself with\\r\\nwatching her companion intently.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked back at her, but at times it was clear that he did not see\\r\\nher and was not thinking of her.\\r\\n\\r\\nAglaya began to flush up.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh yes!â\\x80\\x9d cried the prince, starting. â\\x80\\x9cHippolyteâ\\x80\\x99s suicideâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat? At your house?â\\x80\\x9d she asked, but without much surprise. â\\x80\\x9cHe was\\r\\nalive yesterday evening, wasnâ\\x80\\x99t he? How could you sleep here after\\r\\nthat?â\\x80\\x9d she cried, growing suddenly animated.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, but he didnâ\\x80\\x99t kill himself; the pistol didnâ\\x80\\x99t go off.â\\x80\\x9d Aglaya\\r\\ninsisted on hearing the whole story. She hurried the prince along, but\\r\\ninterrupted him with all sorts of questions, nearly all of which were\\r\\nirrelevant. Among other things, she seemed greatly interested in every\\r\\nword that Evgenie Pavlovitch had said, and made the prince repeat that\\r\\npart of the story over and over again.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, thatâ\\x80\\x99ll do; we must be quick,â\\x80\\x9d she concluded, after hearing all.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe have only an hour here, till eight; I must be home by then without\\r\\nfail, so that they may not find out that I came and sat here with you;\\r\\nbut Iâ\\x80\\x99ve come on business. I have a great deal to say to you. But you\\r\\nhave bowled me over considerably with your news. As to Hippolyte, I\\r\\nthink his pistol was bound not to go off; it was more consistent with\\r\\nthe whole affair. Are you sure he really wished to blow his brains out,\\r\\nand that there was no humbug about the matter?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo humbug at all.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery likely. So he wrote that you were to bring me a copy of his\\r\\nconfession, did he? Why didnâ\\x80\\x99t you bring it?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, he didnâ\\x80\\x99t die! Iâ\\x80\\x99ll ask him for it, if you like.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBring it by all means; you neednâ\\x80\\x99t ask him. He will be delighted, you\\r\\nmay be sure; for, in all probability, he shot at himself simply in\\r\\norder that I might read his confession. Donâ\\x80\\x99t laugh at what I say,\\r\\nplease, Lef Nicolaievitch, because it may very well be the case.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m not laughing. I am convinced, myself, that that may have been\\r\\npartly the reason.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are convinced? You donâ\\x80\\x99t really mean to say you think that\\r\\nhonestly?â\\x80\\x9d asked Aglaya, extremely surprised.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe put her questions very quickly and talked fast, every now and then\\r\\nforgetting what she had begun to say, and not finishing her sentence.\\r\\nShe seemed to be impatient to warn the prince about something or other.\\r\\nShe was in a state of unusual excitement, and though she put on a brave\\r\\nand even defiant air, she seemed to be rather alarmed. She was dressed\\r\\nvery simply, but this suited her well. She continually trembled and\\r\\nblushed, and she sat on the very edge of the seat.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fact that the prince confirmed her idea, about Hippolyte shooting\\r\\nhimself that she might read his confession, surprised her greatly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course,â\\x80\\x9d added the prince, â\\x80\\x9che wished us all to applaud his\\r\\nconductâ\\x80\\x94besides yourself.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow do you meanâ\\x80\\x94applaud?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWellâ\\x80\\x94how am I to explain? He was very anxious that we should all come\\r\\naround him, and say we were so sorry for him, and that we loved him\\r\\nvery much, and all that; and that we hoped he wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t kill himself,\\r\\nbut remain alive. Very likely he thought more of you than the rest of\\r\\nus, because he mentioned you at such a moment, though perhaps he did\\r\\nnot know himself that he had you in his mindâ\\x80\\x99s eye.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t understand you. How could he have me in view, and not be aware\\r\\nof it himself? And yet, I donâ\\x80\\x99t knowâ\\x80\\x94perhaps I do. Do you know I have\\r\\nintended to poison myself at least thirty timesâ\\x80\\x94ever since I was\\r\\nthirteen or soâ\\x80\\x94and to write to my parents before I did it? I used to\\r\\nthink how nice it would be to lie in my coffin, and have them all\\r\\nweeping over me and saying it was all their fault for being so cruel,\\r\\nand all thatâ\\x80\\x94what are you smiling at?â\\x80\\x9d she added, knitting her brow.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat do _you_ think of when you go mooning about alone? I suppose you\\r\\nimagine yourself a field-marshal, and think you have conquered\\r\\nNapoleon?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, I really have thought something of the sort now and then,\\r\\nespecially when just dozing off,â\\x80\\x9d laughed the prince. â\\x80\\x9cOnly it is the\\r\\nAustrians whom I conquerâ\\x80\\x94not Napoleon.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t wish to joke with you, Lef Nicolaievitch. I shall see\\r\\nHippolyte myself. Tell him so. As for you, I think you are behaving\\r\\nvery badly, because it is not right to judge a manâ\\x80\\x99s soul as you are\\r\\njudging Hippolyteâ\\x80\\x99s. You have no gentleness, but only justiceâ\\x80\\x94so you\\r\\nare unjust.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince reflected.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think you are unfair towards me,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cThere is nothing wrong\\r\\nin the thoughts I ascribe to Hippolyte; they are only natural. But of\\r\\ncourse I donâ\\x80\\x99t know for certain what he thought. Perhaps he thought\\r\\nnothing, but simply longed to see human faces once more, and to hear\\r\\nhuman praise and feel human affection. Who knows? Only it all came out\\r\\nwrong, somehow. Some people have luck, and everything comes out right\\r\\nwith them; others have none, and never a thing turns out fortunately.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI suppose you have felt that in your own case,â\\x80\\x9d said Aglaya.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I have,â\\x80\\x9d replied the prince, quite unsuspicious of any irony in\\r\\nthe remark.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHâ\\x80\\x99mâ\\x80\\x94well, at all events, I shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have fallen asleep here, in your\\r\\nplace. It wasnâ\\x80\\x99t nice of you, that. I suppose you fall asleep wherever\\r\\nyou sit down?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut I didnâ\\x80\\x99t sleep a wink all night. I walked and walked about, and\\r\\nwent to where the music wasâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat music?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhere they played last night. Then I found this bench and sat down,\\r\\nand thought and thoughtâ\\x80\\x94and at last I fell fast asleep.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, is that it? That makes a difference, perhaps. What did you go to\\r\\nthe bandstand for?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know; Iâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery wellâ\\x80\\x94afterwards. You are always interrupting me. What woman was\\r\\nit you were dreaming about?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt wasâ\\x80\\x94aboutâ\\x80\\x94you saw herâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuite so; I understand. I understand quite well. You are veryâ\\x80\\x94Well,\\r\\nhow did she appear to you? What did she look like? No, I donâ\\x80\\x99t want to\\r\\nknow anything about her,â\\x80\\x9d said Aglaya, angrily; â\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t interrupt meâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe paused a moment as though getting breath, or trying to master her\\r\\nfeeling of annoyance.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLook here; this is what I called you here for. I wish to make you aâ\\x80\\x94to\\r\\nask you to be my friend. What do you stare at me like that for?â\\x80\\x9d she\\r\\nadded, almost angrily.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince certainly had darted a rather piercing look at her, and now\\r\\nobserved that she had begun to blush violently. At such moments, the\\r\\nmore Aglaya blushed, the angrier she grew with herself; and this was\\r\\nclearly expressed in her eyes, which flashed like fire. As a rule, she\\r\\nvented her wrath on her unfortunate companion, be it who it might. She\\r\\nwas very conscious of her own shyness, and was not nearly so talkative\\r\\nas her sisters for this reasonâ\\x80\\x94in fact, at times she was much too\\r\\nquiet. When, therefore, she was bound to talk, especially at such\\r\\ndelicate moments as this, she invariably did so with an air of haughty\\r\\ndefiance. She always knew beforehand when she was going to blush, long\\r\\nbefore the blush came.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPerhaps you do not wish to accept my proposition?â\\x80\\x9d she asked, gazing\\r\\nhaughtily at the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh yes, I do; but it is so unnecessary. I mean, I did not think you\\r\\nneed make such a proposition,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, looking confused.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat did you suppose, then? Why did you think I invited you out here?\\r\\nI suppose you think me a â\\x80\\x98little fool,â\\x80\\x99 as they all call me at home?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI didnâ\\x80\\x99t know they called you a fool. I certainly donâ\\x80\\x99t think you\\r\\none.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou donâ\\x80\\x99t think me one! Oh, dear me!â\\x80\\x94thatâ\\x80\\x99s very clever of you; you\\r\\nput it so neatly, too.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn my opinion, you are far from a fool sometimesâ\\x80\\x94in fact, you are very\\r\\nintelligent. You said a very clever thing just now about my being\\r\\nunjust because I had _only_ justice. I shall remember that, and think\\r\\nabout it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAglaya blushed with pleasure. All these changes in her expression came\\r\\nabout so naturally and so rapidlyâ\\x80\\x94they delighted the prince; he watched\\r\\nher, and laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cListen,â\\x80\\x9d she began again; â\\x80\\x9cI have long waited to tell you all this,\\r\\never since the time when you sent me that letterâ\\x80\\x94even before that. Half\\r\\nof what I have to say you heard yesterday. I consider you the most\\r\\nhonest and upright of menâ\\x80\\x94more honest and upright than any other man;\\r\\nand if anybody says that your mind isâ\\x80\\x94is sometimes affected, you\\r\\nknowâ\\x80\\x94it is unfair. I always say so and uphold it, because even if your\\r\\nsurface mind be a little affected (of course you will not feel angry\\r\\nwith me for talking soâ\\x80\\x94I am speaking from a higher point of view) yet\\r\\nyour real mind is far better than all theirs put together. Such a mind\\r\\nas they have never even _dreamed_ of; because really, there are _two_\\r\\nmindsâ\\x80\\x94the kind that matters, and the kind that doesnâ\\x80\\x99t matter. Isnâ\\x80\\x99t it\\r\\nso?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMay be! may be so!â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, faintly; his heart was beating\\r\\npainfully.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI knew you would not misunderstand me,â\\x80\\x9d she said, triumphantly.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPrince S. and Evgenie Pavlovitch and Alexandra donâ\\x80\\x99t understand\\r\\nanything about these two kinds of mind, but, just fancy, mamma does!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are very like Lizabetha Prokofievna.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat! surely not?â\\x80\\x9d said Aglaya.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, you are, indeed.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank you; I am glad to be like mamma,â\\x80\\x9d she said, thoughtfully. â\\x80\\x9cYou\\r\\nrespect her very much, donâ\\x80\\x99t you?â\\x80\\x9d she added, quite unconscious of the\\r\\nnaiveness of the question.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Very_ much; and I am so glad that you have realized the fact.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am very glad, too, because she is often laughed at by people. But\\r\\nlisten to the chief point. I have long thought over the matter, and at\\r\\nlast I have chosen you. I donâ\\x80\\x99t wish people to laugh at me; I donâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nwish people to think me a â\\x80\\x98little fool.â\\x80\\x99 I donâ\\x80\\x99t want to be chaffed. I\\r\\nfelt all this of a sudden, and I refused Evgenie Pavlovitch flatly,\\r\\nbecause I am not going to be forever thrown at peopleâ\\x80\\x99s heads to be\\r\\nmarried. I wantâ\\x80\\x94I wantâ\\x80\\x94well, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you, I wish to run away from\\r\\nhome, and I have chosen you to help me.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cRun away from home?â\\x80\\x9d cried the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYesâ\\x80\\x94yesâ\\x80\\x94yes! Run away from home!â\\x80\\x9d she repeated, in a transport of\\r\\nrage. â\\x80\\x9cI wonâ\\x80\\x99t, I wonâ\\x80\\x99t be made to blush every minute by them all! I\\r\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t want to blush before Prince S. or Evgenie Pavlovitch, or anyone,\\r\\nand therefore I have chosen you. I shall tell you everything,\\r\\n_everything_, even the most important things of all, whenever I like,\\r\\nand you are to hide nothing from me on your side. I want to speak to at\\r\\nleast one person, as I would to myself. They have suddenly begun to say\\r\\nthat I am waiting for you, and in love with you. They began this before\\r\\nyou arrived here, and so I didnâ\\x80\\x99t show them the letter, and now they\\r\\nall say it, every one of them. I want to be brave, and be afraid of\\r\\nnobody. I donâ\\x80\\x99t want to go to their balls and thingsâ\\x80\\x94I want to do good.\\r\\nI have long desired to run away, for I have been kept shut up for\\r\\ntwenty years, and they are always trying to marry me off. I wanted to\\r\\nrun away when I was fourteen years oldâ\\x80\\x94I was a little fool then, I\\r\\nknowâ\\x80\\x94but now I have worked it all out, and I have waited for you to\\r\\ntell me about foreign countries. I have never seen a single Gothic\\r\\ncathedral. I must go to Rome; I must see all the museums; I must study\\r\\nin Paris. All this last year I have been preparing and reading\\r\\nforbidden books. Alexandra and Adelaida are allowed to read anything\\r\\nthey like, but I maynâ\\x80\\x99t. I donâ\\x80\\x99t want to quarrel with my sisters, but I\\r\\ntold my parents long ago that I wish to change my social position. I\\r\\nhave decided to take up teaching, and I count on you because you said\\r\\nyou loved children. Can we go in for education togetherâ\\x80\\x94if not at once,\\r\\nthen afterwards? We could do good together. I wonâ\\x80\\x99t be a generalâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ndaughter any more! Tell me, are you a very learned man?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh no; not at all.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh-h-h! Iâ\\x80\\x99m sorry for that. I thought you were. I wonder why I always\\r\\nthought soâ\\x80\\x94but at all events youâ\\x80\\x99ll help me, wonâ\\x80\\x99t you? Because Iâ\\x80\\x99ve\\r\\nchosen you, you know.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAglaya Ivanovna, itâ\\x80\\x99s absurd.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut I will, I _will_ run away!â\\x80\\x9d she criedâ\\x80\\x94and her eyes flashed again\\r\\nwith angerâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cand if you donâ\\x80\\x99t agree I shall go and marry Gavrila\\r\\nArdalionovitch! I wonâ\\x80\\x99t be considered a horrible girl, and accused of\\r\\ngoodness knows what.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAre you out of your mind?â\\x80\\x9d cried the prince, almost starting from his\\r\\nseat. â\\x80\\x9cWhat do they accuse you of? Who accuses you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAt home, everybody, mother, my sisters, Prince S., even that\\r\\ndetestable Colia! If they donâ\\x80\\x99t say it, they think it. I told them all\\r\\nso to their faces. I told mother and father and everybody. Mamma was\\r\\nill all the day after it, and next day father and Alexandra told me\\r\\nthat I didnâ\\x80\\x99t understand what nonsense I was talking. I informed them\\r\\nthat they little knew meâ\\x80\\x94I was not a small childâ\\x80\\x94I understood every\\r\\nword in the languageâ\\x80\\x94that I had read a couple of Paul de Kokâ\\x80\\x99s novels\\r\\ntwo years since on purpose, so as to know all about everything. No\\r\\nsooner did mamma hear me say this than she nearly fainted!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA strange thought passed through the princeâ\\x80\\x99s brain; he gazed intently\\r\\nat Aglaya and smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe could not believe that this was the same haughty young girl who had\\r\\nonce so proudly shown him Ganiaâ\\x80\\x99s letter. He could not understand how\\r\\nthat proud and austere beauty could show herself to be such an utter\\r\\nchildâ\\x80\\x94a child who probably did not even now understand some words.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHave you always lived at home, Aglaya Ivanovna?â\\x80\\x9d he asked. â\\x80\\x9cI mean,\\r\\nhave you never been to school, or college, or anything?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNoâ\\x80\\x94neverâ\\x80\\x94nowhere! Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been at home all my life, corked up in a\\r\\nbottle; and they expect me to be married straight out of it. What are\\r\\nyou laughing at again? I observe that you, too, have taken to laughing\\r\\nat me, and range yourself on their side against me,â\\x80\\x9d she added,\\r\\nfrowning angrily. â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t irritate meâ\\x80\\x94Iâ\\x80\\x99m bad enough without thatâ\\x80\\x94I\\r\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t know what I am doing sometimes. I am persuaded that you came here\\r\\ntoday in the full belief that I am in love with you, and that I\\r\\narranged this meeting because of that,â\\x80\\x9d she cried, with annoyance.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI admit I was afraid that that was the case, yesterday,â\\x80\\x9d blundered the\\r\\nprince (he was rather confused), â\\x80\\x9cbut today I am quite convinced thatâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow?â\\x80\\x9d cried Aglayaâ\\x80\\x94and her lower lip trembled violently. â\\x80\\x9cYou were\\r\\n_afraid_ that Iâ\\x80\\x94you dared to think that Iâ\\x80\\x94good gracious! you suspected,\\r\\nperhaps, that I sent for you to come here in order to catch you in a\\r\\ntrap, so that they should find us here together, and make you marry\\r\\nmeâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAglaya Ivanovna, arenâ\\x80\\x99t you ashamed of saying such a thing? How could\\r\\nsuch a horrible idea enter your sweet, innocent heart? I am certain you\\r\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t believe a word of what you say, and probably you donâ\\x80\\x99t even know\\r\\nwhat you are talking about.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAglaya sat with her eyes on the ground; she seemed to have alarmed even\\r\\nherself by what she had said.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, Iâ\\x80\\x99m not; Iâ\\x80\\x99m not a bit ashamed!â\\x80\\x9d she murmured. â\\x80\\x9cAnd how do you\\r\\nknow my heart is innocent? And how dared you send me a love-letter that\\r\\ntime?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Love-letter?_ My letter a love-letter? That letter was the most\\r\\nrespectful of letters; it went straight from my heart, at what was\\r\\nperhaps the most painful moment of my life! I thought of you at the\\r\\ntime as a kind of light. Iâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, very well, very well!â\\x80\\x9d she said, but quite in a different tone.\\r\\nShe was remorseful now, and bent forward to touch his shoulder, though\\r\\nstill trying not to look him in the face, as if the more persuasively\\r\\nto beg him not to be angry with her. â\\x80\\x9cVery well,â\\x80\\x9d she continued,\\r\\nlooking thoroughly ashamed of herself, â\\x80\\x9cI feel that I said a very\\r\\nfoolish thing. I only did it just to try you. Take it as unsaid, and if\\r\\nI offended you, forgive me. Donâ\\x80\\x99t look straight at me like that,\\r\\nplease; turn your head away. You called it a â\\x80\\x98horrible ideaâ\\x80\\x99; I only\\r\\nsaid it to shock you. Very often I am myself afraid of saying what I\\r\\nintend to say, and out it comes all the same. You have just told me\\r\\nthat you wrote that letter at the most painful moment of your life. I\\r\\nknow what moment that was!â\\x80\\x9d she added softly, looking at the ground\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, if you could know all!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI _do_ know all!â\\x80\\x9d she cried, with another burst of indignation. â\\x80\\x9cYou\\r\\nwere living in the same house as that horrible woman with whom you ran\\r\\naway.â\\x80\\x9d She did not blush as she said this; on the contrary, she grew\\r\\npale, and started from her seat, apparently oblivious of what she did,\\r\\nand immediately sat down again. Her lip continued to tremble for a long\\r\\ntime.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was silence for a moment. The prince was taken aback by the\\r\\nsuddenness of this last reply, and did not know to what he should\\r\\nattribute it.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t love you a bit!â\\x80\\x9d she said suddenly, just as though the words\\r\\nhad exploded from her mouth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince did not answer, and there was silence again. â\\x80\\x9cI love Gavrila\\r\\nArdalionovitch,â\\x80\\x9d she said, quickly; but hardly audibly, and with her\\r\\nhead bent lower than ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is _not_ true,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, in an equally low voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat! I tell stories, do I? It is true! I gave him my promise a couple\\r\\nof days ago on this very seat.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince was startled, and reflected for a moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is not true,â\\x80\\x9d he repeated, decidedly; â\\x80\\x9cyou have just invented it!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are wonderfully polite. You know he is greatly improved. He loves\\r\\nme better than his life. He let his hand burn before my very eyes in\\r\\norder to prove to me that he loved me better than his life!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe burned his hand!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, believe it or not! Itâ\\x80\\x99s all the same to me!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince sat silent once more. Aglaya did not seem to be joking; she\\r\\nwas too angry for that.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat! he brought a candle with him to this place? That is, if the\\r\\nepisode happened here; otherwise I canâ\\x80\\x99t.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, a candle! Whatâ\\x80\\x99s there improbable about that?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA whole one, and in a candlestick?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYesâ\\x80\\x94noâ\\x80\\x94half a candleâ\\x80\\x94an end, you knowâ\\x80\\x94no, it was a whole candle; itâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nall the same. Be quiet, canâ\\x80\\x99t you! He brought a box of matches too, if\\r\\nyou like, and then lighted the candle and held his finger in it for\\r\\nhalf an hour and more!â\\x80\\x94There! Canâ\\x80\\x99t that be?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI saw him yesterday, and his fingers were all right!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAglaya suddenly burst out laughing, as simply as a child.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you know why I have just told you these lies?â\\x80\\x9d She appealed to the\\r\\nprince, of a sudden, with the most childlike candour, and with the\\r\\nlaugh still trembling on her lips. â\\x80\\x9cBecause when one tells a lie, if\\r\\none insists on something unusual and eccentricâ\\x80\\x94something too â\\x80\\x98out of\\r\\nthe wayâ\\x80\\x99 for anything, you knowâ\\x80\\x94the more impossible the thing is, the\\r\\nmore plausible does the lie sound. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve noticed this. But I managed it\\r\\nbadly; I didnâ\\x80\\x99t know how to work it.â\\x80\\x9d She suddenly frowned again at\\r\\nthis point as though at some sudden unpleasant recollection.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIfâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94she began, looking seriously and even sadly at himâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cif when I read\\r\\nyou all that about the â\\x80\\x98poor knight,â\\x80\\x99 I wished to-to praise you for one\\r\\nthingâ\\x80\\x94I also wished to show you that I knew allâ\\x80\\x94and did not approve of\\r\\nyour conduct.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are very unfair to me, and to that unfortunate woman of whom you\\r\\nspoke just now in such dreadful terms, Aglaya.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBecause I know all, allâ\\x80\\x94and that is why I speak so. I know very well\\r\\nhow youâ\\x80\\x94half a year sinceâ\\x80\\x94offered her your hand before everybody. Donâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\ninterrupt me. You see, I am merely stating facts without any comment\\r\\nupon them. After that she ran away with Rogojin. Then you lived with\\r\\nher at some village or town, and she ran away from you.â\\x80\\x9d (Aglaya\\r\\nblushed dreadfully.) â\\x80\\x9cThen she returned to Rogojin again, who loves her\\r\\nlike a madman. Then youâ\\x80\\x94like a wise man as you areâ\\x80\\x94came back here after\\r\\nher as soon as ever you heard that she had returned to Petersburg.\\r\\nYesterday evening you sprang forward to protect her, and just now you\\r\\ndreamed about her. You see, I know all. You did come back here for her,\\r\\nfor herâ\\x80\\x94now didnâ\\x80\\x99t you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYesâ\\x80\\x94for her!â\\x80\\x9d said the prince softly and sadly, and bending his head\\r\\ndown, quite unconscious of the fact that Aglaya was gazing at him with\\r\\neyes which burned like live coals. â\\x80\\x9cI came to find out somethingâ\\x80\\x94I\\r\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t believe in her future happiness as Rogojinâ\\x80\\x99s wife, althoughâ\\x80\\x94in a\\r\\nword, I did not know how to help her or what to do for herâ\\x80\\x94but I came,\\r\\non the chance.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe glanced at Aglaya, who was listening with a look of hatred on her\\r\\nface.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf you came without knowing why, I suppose you love her very much\\r\\nindeed!â\\x80\\x9d she said at last.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, â\\x80\\x9cno, I do not love her. Oh! if you only knew\\r\\nwith what horror I recall the time I spent with her!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA shudder seemed to sweep over his whole body at the recollection.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTell me about it,â\\x80\\x9d said Aglaya.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere is nothing which you might not hear. Why I should wish to tell\\r\\nyou, and only you, this experience of mine, I really cannot say;\\r\\nperhaps it really is because I love you very much. This unhappy woman\\r\\nis persuaded that she is the most hopeless, fallen creature in the\\r\\nworld. Oh, do not condemn her! Do not cast stones at her! She has\\r\\nsuffered too much already in the consciousness of her own undeserved\\r\\nshame.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd she is not guiltyâ\\x80\\x94oh God!â\\x80\\x94Every moment she bemoans and bewails\\r\\nherself, and cries out that she does not admit any guilt, that she is\\r\\nthe victim of circumstancesâ\\x80\\x94the victim of a wicked libertine.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut whatever she may say, remember that she does not believe it\\r\\nherself,â\\x80\\x94remember that she will believe nothing but that she is a\\r\\nguilty creature.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen I tried to rid her soul of this gloomy fallacy, she suffered so\\r\\nterribly that my heart will never be quite at peace so long as I can\\r\\nremember that dreadful time!â\\x80\\x94Do you know why she left me? Simply to\\r\\nprove to me what is not trueâ\\x80\\x94that she is base. But the worst of it is,\\r\\nshe did not realize herself that that was all she wanted to prove by\\r\\nher departure! She went away in response to some inner prompting to do\\r\\nsomething disgraceful, in order that she might say to\\r\\nherselfâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98Thereâ\\x80\\x94youâ\\x80\\x99ve done a new act of shameâ\\x80\\x94you degraded creature!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, Aglayaâ\\x80\\x94perhaps you cannot understand all this. Try to realize that\\r\\nin the perpetual admission of guilt she probably finds some dreadful\\r\\nunnatural satisfactionâ\\x80\\x94as though she were revenging herself upon\\r\\nsomeone.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow and then I was able to persuade her almost to see light around her\\r\\nagain; but she would soon fall, once more, into her old tormenting\\r\\ndelusions, and would go so far as to reproach me for placing myself on\\r\\na pedestal above her (I never had an idea of such a thing!), and\\r\\ninformed me, in reply to my proposal of marriage, that she â\\x80\\x98did not\\r\\nwant condescending sympathy or help from anybody.â\\x80\\x99 You saw her last\\r\\nnight. You donâ\\x80\\x99t suppose she can be happy among such people as\\r\\nthoseâ\\x80\\x94you cannot suppose that such society is fit for her? You have no\\r\\nidea how well-educated she is, and what an intellect she has! She\\r\\nastonished me sometimes.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd you preached her sermons there, did you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh no,â\\x80\\x9d continued the prince thoughtfully, not noticing Aglayaâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nmocking tone, â\\x80\\x9cI was almost always silent there. I often wished to\\r\\nspeak, but I really did not know what to say. In some cases it is best\\r\\nto say nothing, I think. I loved her, yes, I loved her very much\\r\\nindeed; but afterwardsâ\\x80\\x94afterwards she guessed all.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat did she guess?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat I only _pitied_ herâ\\x80\\x94andâ\\x80\\x94and loved her no longer!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow do you know that? How do you know that she is not really in love\\r\\nwith thatâ\\x80\\x94that rich cadâ\\x80\\x94the man she eloped with?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh no! I know she only laughs at him; she has made a fool of him all\\r\\nalong.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHas she never laughed at you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNoâ\\x80\\x94in anger, perhaps. Oh yes! she reproached me dreadfully in anger;\\r\\nand suffered herself, too! But afterwardsâ\\x80\\x94oh! donâ\\x80\\x99t remind meâ\\x80\\x94donâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nremind me of that!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe hid his face in his hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAre you aware that she writes to me almost every day?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo that is true, is it?â\\x80\\x9d cried the prince, greatly agitated. â\\x80\\x9cI had\\r\\nheard a report of it, but would not believe it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhom did you hear it from?â\\x80\\x9d asked Aglaya, alarmed. â\\x80\\x9cRogojin said\\r\\nsomething about it yesterday, but nothing definite.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYesterday! Morning or evening? Before the music or after?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAfterâ\\x80\\x94it was about twelve oâ\\x80\\x99clock.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh! Well, if it was Rogojinâ\\x80\\x94but do you know what she writes to me\\r\\nabout?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI should not be surprised by anything. She is mad!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere are the letters.â\\x80\\x9d (Aglaya took three letters out of her pocket\\r\\nand threw them down before the prince.) â\\x80\\x9cFor a whole week she has been\\r\\nentreating and worrying and persuading me to marry you. Sheâ\\x80\\x94well, she\\r\\nis clever, though she may be madâ\\x80\\x94much cleverer than I am, as you say.\\r\\nWell, she writes that she is in love with me herself, and tries to see\\r\\nme every day, if only from a distance. She writes that you love me, and\\r\\nthat she has long known it and seen it, and that you and she talked\\r\\nabout meâ\\x80\\x94there. She wishes to see you happy, and she says that she is\\r\\ncertain only I can ensure you the happiness you deserve. She writes\\r\\nsuch strange, wild lettersâ\\x80\\x94I havenâ\\x80\\x99t shown them to anyone. Now, do you\\r\\nknow what all this means? Can you guess anything?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is madnessâ\\x80\\x94it is merely another proof of her insanity!â\\x80\\x9d said the\\r\\nprince, and his lips trembled.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are crying, arenâ\\x80\\x99t you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, Aglaya. No, Iâ\\x80\\x99m not crying.â\\x80\\x9d The prince looked at her.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, what am I to do? What do you advise me? I cannot go on receiving\\r\\nthese letters, you know.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, let her alone, I entreat you!â\\x80\\x9d cried the prince. â\\x80\\x9cWhat can you do\\r\\nin this dark, gloomy mystery? Let her alone, and Iâ\\x80\\x99ll use all my power\\r\\nto prevent her writing you any more letters.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf so, you are a heartless man!â\\x80\\x9d cried Aglaya. â\\x80\\x9cAs if you canâ\\x80\\x99t see\\r\\nthat it is not myself she loves, but you, you, and only you! Surely you\\r\\nhave not remarked everything else in her, and only not _this?_ Do you\\r\\nknow what these letters mean? They mean jealousy, sirâ\\x80\\x94nothing but pure\\r\\njealousy! Sheâ\\x80\\x94do you think she will ever really marry this Rogojin, as\\r\\nshe says here she will? She would take her own life the day after you\\r\\nand I were married.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince shuddered; his heart seemed to freeze within him. He gazed\\r\\nat Aglaya in wonderment; it was difficult for him to realize that this\\r\\nchild was also a woman.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGod knows, Aglaya, that to restore her peace of mind and make her\\r\\nhappy I would willingly give up my life. But I cannot love her, and she\\r\\nknows that.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, make a sacrifice of yourself! That sort of thing becomes you well,\\r\\nyou know. Why not do it? And donâ\\x80\\x99t call me â\\x80\\x98Aglayaâ\\x80\\x99; you have done it\\r\\nseveral times lately. You are bound, it is your _duty_ to â\\x80\\x98raiseâ\\x80\\x99 her;\\r\\nyou must go off somewhere again to soothe and pacify her. Why, you love\\r\\nher, you know!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI cannot sacrifice myself so, though I admit I did wish to do so once.\\r\\nWho knows, perhaps I still wish to! But I know for _certain_, that if\\r\\nshe married me it would be her ruin; I know this and therefore I leave\\r\\nher alone. I ought to go to see her today; now I shall probably not go.\\r\\nShe is proud, she would never forgive me the nature of the love I bear\\r\\nher, and we should both be ruined. This may be unnatural, I donâ\\x80\\x99t know;\\r\\nbut everything seems unnatural. You say she loves me, as if this were\\r\\n_love!_ As if she could love _me_, after what I have been through! No,\\r\\nno, it is not love.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow pale you have grown!â\\x80\\x9d cried Aglaya in alarm.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, itâ\\x80\\x99s nothing. I havenâ\\x80\\x99t slept, thatâ\\x80\\x99s all, and Iâ\\x80\\x99m rather tired.\\r\\nIâ\\x80\\x94we certainly did talk about you, Aglaya.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, indeed, it is true then! _You could actually talk about me with\\r\\nher_; andâ\\x80\\x94and how could you have been fond of me when you had only seen\\r\\nme once?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know. Perhaps it was that I seemed to come upon light in the\\r\\nmidst of my gloom. I told you the truth when I said I did not know why\\r\\nI thought of you before all others. Of course it was all a sort of\\r\\ndream, a dream amidst the horrors of reality. Afterwards I began to\\r\\nwork. I did not intend to come back here for two or three yearsâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen you came for her sake?â\\x80\\x9d Aglayaâ\\x80\\x99s voice trembled.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I came for her sake.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a moment or two of gloomy silence. Aglaya rose from her seat.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf you say,â\\x80\\x9d she began in shaky tones, â\\x80\\x9cif you say that this woman of\\r\\nyours is madâ\\x80\\x94at all events I have nothing to do with her insane\\r\\nfancies. Kindly take these three letters, Lef Nicolaievitch, and throw\\r\\nthem back to her, from me. And if she dares,â\\x80\\x9d cried Aglaya suddenly,\\r\\nmuch louder than before, â\\x80\\x9cif she dares so much as write me one word\\r\\nagain, tell her I shall tell my father, and that she shall be taken to\\r\\na lunatic asylum.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince jumped up in alarm at Aglayaâ\\x80\\x99s sudden wrath, and a mist\\r\\nseemed to come before his eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou cannot really feel like that! You donâ\\x80\\x99t mean what you say. It is\\r\\nnot true,â\\x80\\x9d he murmured.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt _is_ true, it _is_ true,â\\x80\\x9d cried Aglaya, almost beside herself with\\r\\nrage.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s true? Whatâ\\x80\\x99s all this? Whatâ\\x80\\x99s true?â\\x80\\x9d said an alarmed voice just\\r\\nbeside them.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore them stood Lizabetha Prokofievna.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, itâ\\x80\\x99s true that I am going to marry Gavrila Ardalionovitch, that I\\r\\nlove him and intend to elope with him tomorrow,â\\x80\\x9d cried Aglaya, turning\\r\\nupon her mother. â\\x80\\x9cDo you hear? Is your curiosity satisfied? Are you\\r\\npleased with what you have heard?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAglaya rushed away homewards with these words.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHâ\\x80\\x99m! well, _you_ are not going away just yet, my friend, at all\\r\\nevents,â\\x80\\x9d said Lizabetha, stopping the prince. â\\x80\\x9cKindly step home with\\r\\nme, and let me have a little explanation of the mystery. Nice goings\\r\\non, these! I havenâ\\x80\\x99t slept a wink all night as it is.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince followed her.\\r\\n\\r\\nIX.\\r\\n\\r\\nArrived at her house, Lizabetha Prokofievna paused in the first room.\\r\\nShe could go no farther, and subsided on to a couch quite exhausted;\\r\\ntoo feeble to remember so much as to ask the prince to take a seat.\\r\\nThis was a large reception-room, full of flowers, and with a glass door\\r\\nleading into the garden.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlexandra and Adelaida came in almost immediately, and looked\\r\\ninquiringly at the prince and their mother.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girls generally rose at about nine in the morning in the country;\\r\\nAglaya, of late, had been in the habit of getting up rather earlier and\\r\\nhaving a walk in the garden, but not at seven oâ\\x80\\x99clock; about eight or a\\r\\nlittle later was her usual time.\\r\\n\\r\\nLizabetha Prokofievna, who really had not slept all night, rose at\\r\\nabout eight on purpose to meet Aglaya in the garden and walk with her;\\r\\nbut she could not find her either in the garden or in her own room.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis agitated the old lady considerably; and she awoke her other\\r\\ndaughters. Next, she learned from the maid that Aglaya had gone into\\r\\nthe park before seven oâ\\x80\\x99clock. The sisters made a joke of Aglayaâ\\x80\\x99s last\\r\\nfreak, and told their mother that if she went into the park to look for\\r\\nher, Aglaya would probably be very angry with her, and that she was\\r\\npretty sure to be sitting reading on the green bench that she had\\r\\ntalked of two or three days since, and about which she had nearly\\r\\nquarrelled with Prince S., who did not see anything particularly lovely\\r\\nin it.\\r\\n\\r\\nArrived at the rendezvous of the prince and her daughter, and hearing\\r\\nthe strange words of the latter, Lizabetha Prokofievna had been\\r\\ndreadfully alarmed, for many reasons. However, now that she had dragged\\r\\nthe prince home with her, she began to feel a little frightened at what\\r\\nshe had undertaken. Why should not Aglaya meet the prince in the park\\r\\nand have a talk with him, even if such a meeting should be by\\r\\nappointment?\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t suppose, prince,â\\x80\\x9d she began, bracing herself up for the effort,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t suppose that I have brought you here to ask questions. After\\r\\nlast night, I assure you, I am not so exceedingly anxious to see you at\\r\\nall; I could have postponed the pleasure for a long while.â\\x80\\x9d She paused.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut at the same time you would be very glad to know how I happened to\\r\\nmeet Aglaya Ivanovna this morning?â\\x80\\x9d The prince finished her speech for\\r\\nher with the utmost composure.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, what then? Supposing I should like to know?â\\x80\\x9d cried Lizabetha\\r\\nProkofievna, blushing. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m sure I am not afraid of plain speaking. Iâ\\x80\\x99m\\r\\nnot offending anyone, and I never wish to, andâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPardon me, it is no offence to wish to know this; you are her mother.\\r\\nWe met at the green bench this morning, punctually at seven\\r\\noâ\\x80\\x99clock,â\\x80\\x94according to an agreement made by Aglaya Ivanovna with myself\\r\\nyesterday. She said that she wished to see me and speak to me about\\r\\nsomething important. We met and conversed for an hour about matters\\r\\nconcerning Aglaya Ivanovna herself, and thatâ\\x80\\x99s all.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course it is all, my friend. I donâ\\x80\\x99t doubt you for a moment,â\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nLizabetha Prokofievna with dignity.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell done, prince, capital!â\\x80\\x9d cried Aglaya, who entered the room at\\r\\nthis moment. â\\x80\\x9cThank you for assuming that I would not demean myself\\r\\nwith lies. Come, is that enough, mamma, or do you intend to put any\\r\\nmore questions?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou know I have never needed to blush before you, up to this day,\\r\\nthough perhaps you would have been glad enough to make me,â\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nLizabetha Prokofievna,â\\x80\\x94with majesty. â\\x80\\x9cGood-bye, prince; forgive me for\\r\\nbothering you. I trust you will rest assured of my unalterable esteem\\r\\nfor you.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince made his bows and retired at once. Alexandra and Adelaida\\r\\nsmiled and whispered to each other, while Lizabetha Prokofievna glared\\r\\nseverely at them. â\\x80\\x9cWe are only laughing at the princeâ\\x80\\x99s beautiful bows,\\r\\nmamma,â\\x80\\x9d said Adelaida. â\\x80\\x9cSometimes he bows just like a meal-sack, but\\r\\nto-day he was likeâ\\x80\\x94like Evgenie Pavlovitch!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is the _heart_ which is the best teacher of refinement and dignity,\\r\\nnot the dancing-master,â\\x80\\x9d said her mother, sententiously, and departed\\r\\nupstairs to her own room, not so much as glancing at Aglaya.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the prince reached home, about nine oâ\\x80\\x99clock, he found Vera\\r\\nLebedeff and the maid on the verandah. They were both busy trying to\\r\\ntidy up the place after last nightâ\\x80\\x99s disorderly party.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank goodness, weâ\\x80\\x99ve just managed to finish it before you came in!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nsaid Vera, joyfully.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood-morning! My head whirls so; I didnâ\\x80\\x99t sleep all night. I should\\r\\nlike to have a nap now.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHere, on the verandah? Very well, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll tell them all not to come and\\r\\nwake you. Papa has gone out somewhere.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe servant left the room. Vera was about to follow her, but returned\\r\\nand approached the prince with a preoccupied air.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPrince!â\\x80\\x9d she said, â\\x80\\x9chave pity on that poor boy; donâ\\x80\\x99t turn him out\\r\\ntoday.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot for the world; he shall do just as he likes.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe wonâ\\x80\\x99t do any harm now; andâ\\x80\\x94and donâ\\x80\\x99t be too severe with him.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh dear no! Whyâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAndâ\\x80\\x94and you wonâ\\x80\\x99t _laugh_ at him? Thatâ\\x80\\x99s the chief thing.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh no! Never.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow foolish I am to speak of such things to a man like you,â\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nVera, blushing. â\\x80\\x9cThough you _do_ look tired,â\\x80\\x9d she added, half turning\\r\\naway, â\\x80\\x9cyour eyes are so splendid at this momentâ\\x80\\x94so full of happiness.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cReally?â\\x80\\x9d asked the prince, gleefully, and he laughed in delight.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Vera, simple-minded little girl that she was (just like a boy, in\\r\\nfact), here became dreadfully confused, of a sudden, and ran hastily\\r\\nout of the room, laughing and blushing.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat a dear little thing she is,â\\x80\\x9d thought the prince, and immediately\\r\\nforgot all about her.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe walked to the far end of the verandah, where the sofa stood, with a\\r\\ntable in front of it. Here he sat down and covered his face with his\\r\\nhands, and so remained for ten minutes. Suddenly he put his hand in his\\r\\ncoat-pocket and hurriedly produced three letters.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the door opened again, and out came Colia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince actually felt glad that he had been interrupted,â\\x80\\x94and might\\r\\nreturn the letters to his pocket. He was glad of the respite.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell,â\\x80\\x9d said Colia, plunging _in medias res_, as he always did, â\\x80\\x9chereâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\na go! What do you think of Hippolyte now? Donâ\\x80\\x99t respect him any longer,\\r\\neh?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy not? But look here, Colia, Iâ\\x80\\x99m tired; besides, the subject is too\\r\\nmelancholy to begin upon again. How is he, though?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAsleepâ\\x80\\x94heâ\\x80\\x99ll sleep for a couple of hours yet. I quite understandâ\\x80\\x94you\\r\\nhavenâ\\x80\\x99t sleptâ\\x80\\x94you walked about the park, I know.\\r\\nAgitationâ\\x80\\x94excitementâ\\x80\\x94all that sort of thingâ\\x80\\x94quite natural, too!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow do you know I walked in the park and didnâ\\x80\\x99t sleep at home?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVera just told me. She tried to persuade me not to come, but I\\r\\ncouldnâ\\x80\\x99t help myself, just for one minute. I have been having my turn\\r\\nat the bedside for the last two hours; Kostia Lebedeff is there now.\\r\\nBurdovsky has gone. Now, lie down, prince, make yourself comfortable,\\r\\nand sleep well! Iâ\\x80\\x99m awfully impressed, you know.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNaturally, all thisâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, no, I mean with the â\\x80\\x98explanation,â\\x80\\x99 especially that part of it\\r\\nwhere he talks about Providence and a future life. There is a gigantic\\r\\nthought there.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince gazed affectionately at Colia, who, of course, had come in\\r\\nsolely for the purpose of talking about this â\\x80\\x9cgigantic thought.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut it is not any one particular thought, only; it is the general\\r\\ncircumstances of the case. If Voltaire had written this now, or\\r\\nRousseau, I should have just read it and thought it remarkable, but\\r\\nshould not have been so _impressed_ by it. But a man who knows for\\r\\ncertain that he has but ten minutes to live and can talk like\\r\\nthatâ\\x80\\x94whyâ\\x80\\x94itâ\\x80\\x99sâ\\x80\\x94itâ\\x80\\x99s _pride_, that is! It is really a most extraordinary,\\r\\nexalted assertion of personal dignity, itâ\\x80\\x99sâ\\x80\\x94itâ\\x80\\x99s _defiant!_ What a\\r\\n_gigantic_ strength of will, eh? And to accuse a fellow like that of\\r\\nnot putting in the cap on purpose; itâ\\x80\\x99s base and mean! You know he\\r\\ndeceived us last night, the cunning rascal. I never packed his bag for\\r\\nhim, and I never saw his pistol. He packed it himself. But he put me\\r\\noff my guard like that, you see. Vera says you are going to let him\\r\\nstay on; I swear thereâ\\x80\\x99s no danger, especially as we are always with\\r\\nhim.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWho was by him at night?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI, and Burdovsky, and Kostia Lebedeff. Keller stayed a little while,\\r\\nand then went over to Lebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s to sleep. Ferdishenko slept at\\r\\nLebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s, too; but he went away at seven oâ\\x80\\x99clock. My father is always\\r\\nat Lebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s; but he has gone out just now. I dare say Lebedeff will\\r\\nbe coming in here directly; he has been looking for you; I donâ\\x80\\x99t know\\r\\nwhat he wants. Shall we let him in or not, if you are asleep? Iâ\\x80\\x99m going\\r\\nto have a nap, too. By-the-by, such a curious thing happened. Burdovsky\\r\\nwoke me at seven, and I met my father just outside the room, so drunk,\\r\\nhe didnâ\\x80\\x99t even know me. He stood before me like a log, and when he\\r\\nrecovered himself, asked hurriedly how Hippolyte was. â\\x80\\x98Yes,â\\x80\\x99 he said,\\r\\nwhen I told him, â\\x80\\x98thatâ\\x80\\x99s all very well, but I _really_ came to warn you\\r\\nthat you must be very careful what you say before Ferdishenko.â\\x80\\x99 Do you\\r\\nfollow me, prince?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes. Is it really so? However, itâ\\x80\\x99s all the same to us, of course.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course it is; we are not a secret society; and that being the case,\\r\\nit is all the more curious that the general should have been on his way\\r\\nto wake me up in order to tell me this.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFerdishenko has gone, you say?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, he went at seven oâ\\x80\\x99clock. He came into the room on his way out; I\\r\\nwas watching just then. He said he was going to spend â\\x80\\x98the rest of the\\r\\nnightâ\\x80\\x99 at Wilkinâ\\x80\\x99s; thereâ\\x80\\x99s a tipsy fellow, a friend of his, of that\\r\\nname. Well, Iâ\\x80\\x99m off. Oh, hereâ\\x80\\x99s Lebedeff himself! The prince wants to\\r\\ngo to sleep, Lukian Timofeyovitch, so you may just go away again.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOne moment, my dear prince, just one. I must absolutely speak to you\\r\\nabout something which is most grave,â\\x80\\x9d said Lebedeff, mysteriously and\\r\\nsolemnly, entering the room with a bow and looking extremely important.\\r\\nHe had but just returned, and carried his hat in his hand. He looked\\r\\npreoccupied and most unusually dignified.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince begged him to take a chair.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI hear you have called twice; I suppose you are still worried about\\r\\nyesterdayâ\\x80\\x99s affair.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat, about that boy, you mean? Oh dear no, yesterday my ideas were a\\r\\nlittleâ\\x80\\x94wellâ\\x80\\x94mixed. Today, I assure you, I shall not oppose in the\\r\\nslightest degree any suggestions it may please you to make.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s up with you this morning, Lebedeff? You look so important and\\r\\ndignified, and you choose your words so carefully,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince,\\r\\nsmiling.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNicolai Ardalionovitch!â\\x80\\x9d said Lebedeff, in a most amiable tone of\\r\\nvoice, addressing the boy. â\\x80\\x9cAs I have a communication to make to the\\r\\nprince which concerns only myselfâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course, of course, not my affair. All right,â\\x80\\x9d said Colia, and away\\r\\nhe went.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI love that boy for his perception,â\\x80\\x9d said Lebedeff, looking after him.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear prince,â\\x80\\x9d he continued, â\\x80\\x9cI have had a terrible misfortune,\\r\\neither last night or early this morning. I cannot tell the exact time.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat is it?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have lost four hundred roubles out of my side pocket! Theyâ\\x80\\x99re gone!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nsaid Lebedeff, with a sour smile.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ve lost four hundred roubles? Oh! Iâ\\x80\\x99m sorry for that.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, it is serious for a poor man who lives by his toil.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course, of course! How was it?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, the wine is to blame, of course. I confess to you, prince, as I\\r\\nwould to Providence itself. Yesterday I received four hundred roubles\\r\\nfrom a debtor at about five in the afternoon, and came down here by\\r\\ntrain. I had my purse in my pocket. When I changed, I put the money\\r\\ninto the pocket of my plain clothes, intending to keep it by me, as I\\r\\nexpected to have an applicant for it in the evening.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s true then, Lebedeff, that you advertise to lend money on gold or\\r\\nsilver articles?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, through an agent. My own name doesnâ\\x80\\x99t appear. I have a large\\r\\nfamily, you see, and at a small percentageâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuite so, quite so. I only asked for informationâ\\x80\\x94excuse the question.\\r\\nGo on.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, meanwhile that sick boy was brought here, and those guests came\\r\\nin, and we had tea, andâ\\x80\\x94well, we made merryâ\\x80\\x94to my ruin! Hearing of your\\r\\nbirthday afterwards, and excited with the circumstances of the evening,\\r\\nI ran upstairs and changed my plain clothes once more for my uniform\\r\\n[Civil Service clerks in Russia wear uniform.]â\\x80\\x94you must have noticed I\\r\\nhad my uniform on all the evening? Well, I forgot the money in the\\r\\npocket of my old coatâ\\x80\\x94you know when God will ruin a man he first of all\\r\\nbereaves him of his sensesâ\\x80\\x94and it was only this morning at half-past\\r\\nseven that I woke up and grabbed at my coat pocket, first thing. The\\r\\npocket was emptyâ\\x80\\x94the purse gone, and not a trace to be found!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDear me! This is very unpleasant!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cUnpleasant! Indeed it is. You have found a very appropriate\\r\\nexpression,â\\x80\\x9d said Lebedeff, politely, but with sarcasm.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut whatâ\\x80\\x99s to be done? Itâ\\x80\\x99s a serious matter,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince,\\r\\nthoughtfully. â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t you think you may have dropped it out of your\\r\\npocket whilst intoxicated?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly. Anything is possible when one is intoxicated, as you neatly\\r\\nexpress it, prince. But considerâ\\x80\\x94if I, intoxicated or not, dropped an\\r\\nobject out of my pocket on to the ground, that object ought to remain\\r\\non the ground. Where is the object, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDidnâ\\x80\\x99t you put it away in some drawer, perhaps?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve looked everywhere, and turned out everything.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI confess this disturbs me a good deal. Someone must have picked it\\r\\nup, then.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOr taken it out of my pocketâ\\x80\\x94two alternatives.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is very distressing, because _who_â\\x80\\x94? Thatâ\\x80\\x99s the question!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMost undoubtedly, excellent prince, you have hit itâ\\x80\\x94that is the very\\r\\nquestion. How wonderfully you express the exact situation in a few\\r\\nwords!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome, come, Lebedeff, no sarcasm! Itâ\\x80\\x99s a seriousâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSarcasm!â\\x80\\x9d cried Lebedeff, wringing his hands. â\\x80\\x9cAll right, all right,\\r\\nIâ\\x80\\x99m not angry. Iâ\\x80\\x99m only put out about this. Whom do you suspect?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is a very difficult and complicated question. I cannot suspect\\r\\nthe servant, for she was in the kitchen the whole evening, nor do I\\r\\nsuspect any of my children.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI should think not. Go on.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen it must be one of the guests.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs such a thing possible?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAbsolutely and utterly impossibleâ\\x80\\x94and yet, so it must be. But one\\r\\nthing I am sure of, if it be a theft, it was committed, not in the\\r\\nevening when we were all together, but either at night or early in the\\r\\nmorning; therefore, by one of those who slept here. Burdovsky and Colia\\r\\nI except, of course. They did not even come into my room.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, or even if they had! But who did sleep with you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFour of us, including myself, in two rooms. The general, myself,\\r\\nKeller, and Ferdishenko. One of us four it must have been. I donâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nsuspect myself, though such cases have been known.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh! _do_ go on, Lebedeff! Donâ\\x80\\x99t drag it out so.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, there are three left, thenâ\\x80\\x94Keller firstly. He is a drunkard to\\r\\nbegin with, and a liberal (in the sense of other peopleâ\\x80\\x99s pockets),\\r\\notherwise with more of the ancient knight about him than of the modern\\r\\nliberal. He was with the sick man at first, but came over afterwards\\r\\nbecause there was no place to lie down in the room and the floor was so\\r\\nhard.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou suspect him?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI _did_ suspect him. When I woke up at half-past seven and tore my\\r\\nhair in despair for my loss and carelessness, I awoke the general, who\\r\\nwas sleeping the sleep of innocence near me. Taking into consideration\\r\\nthe sudden disappearance of Ferdishenko, which was suspicious in\\r\\nitself, we decided to search Keller, who was lying there sleeping like\\r\\na top. Well, we searched his clothes thoroughly, and not a farthing did\\r\\nwe find; in fact, his pockets all had holes in them. We found a dirty\\r\\nhandkerchief, and a love-letter from some scullery-maid. The general\\r\\ndecided that he was innocent. We awoke him for further inquiries, and\\r\\nhad the greatest difficulty in making him understand what was up. He\\r\\nopened his mouth and staredâ\\x80\\x94he looked so stupid and so absurdly\\r\\ninnocent. It wasnâ\\x80\\x99t Keller.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, Iâ\\x80\\x99m so glad!â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, joyfully. â\\x80\\x9cI was so afraid.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAfraid! Then you had some grounds for supposing he might be the\\r\\nculprit?â\\x80\\x9d said Lebedeff, frowning.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh noâ\\x80\\x94not a bit! It was foolish of me to say I was afraid! Donâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nrepeat it please, Lebedeff, donâ\\x80\\x99t tell anyone I said that!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear prince! your words lie in the lowest depth of my heartâ\\x80\\x94it is\\r\\ntheir tomb!â\\x80\\x9d said Lebedeff, solemnly, pressing his hat to the region of\\r\\nhis heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThanks; very well. Then I suppose itâ\\x80\\x99s Ferdishenko; that is, I mean,\\r\\nyou suspect Ferdishenko?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhom else?â\\x80\\x9d said Lebedeff, softly, gazing intently into the prince s\\r\\nface.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf courseâ\\x80\\x94quite so, whom else? But what are the proofs?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe have evidence. In the first place, his mysterious disappearance at\\r\\nseven oâ\\x80\\x99clock, or even earlier.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know, Colia told me that he had said he was off toâ\\x80\\x94I forget the\\r\\nname, some friend of his, to finish the night.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHâ\\x80\\x99m! then Colia has spoken to you already?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot about the theft.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe does not know of it; I have kept it a secret. Very well,\\r\\nFerdishenko went off to Wilkinâ\\x80\\x99s. That is not so curious in itself, but\\r\\nhere the evidence opens out further. He left his address, you see, when\\r\\nhe went. Now prince, consider, why did he leave his address? Why do you\\r\\nsuppose he went out of his way to tell Colia that he had gone to\\r\\nWilkinâ\\x80\\x99s? Who cared to know that he was going to Wilkinâ\\x80\\x99s? No, no!\\r\\nprince, this is finesse, thievesâ\\x80\\x99 finesse! This is as good as saying,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98There, how can I be a thief when I leave my address? Iâ\\x80\\x99m not\\r\\nconcealing my movements as a thief would.â\\x80\\x99 Do you understand, prince?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh yes, but that is not enough.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSecond proof. The scent turns out to be false, and the address given\\r\\nis a sham. An hour afterâ\\x80\\x94that is at about eight, I went to Wilkinâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nmyself, and there was no trace of Ferdishenko. The maid did tell me,\\r\\ncertainly, that an hour or so since someone had been hammering at the\\r\\ndoor, and had smashed the bell; she said she would not open the door\\r\\nbecause she didnâ\\x80\\x99t want to wake her master; probably she was too lazy\\r\\nto get up herself. Such phenomena are met with occasionally!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut is that all your evidence? It is not enough!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, prince, whom are we to suspect, then? Consider!â\\x80\\x9d said Lebedeff\\r\\nwith almost servile amiability, smiling at the prince. There was a look\\r\\nof cunning in his eyes, however.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou should search your room and all the cupboards again,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\r\\nprince, after a moment or two of silent reflection.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut I have done so, my dear prince!â\\x80\\x9d said Lebedeff, more sweetly than\\r\\never.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHâ\\x80\\x99m! why must you needs go up and change your coat like that?â\\x80\\x9d asked\\r\\nthe prince, banging the table with his fist, in annoyance.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, donâ\\x80\\x99t be so worried on my account, prince! I assure you I am not\\r\\nworth it! At least, not I alone. But I see you are suffering on behalf\\r\\nof the criminal too, for wretched Ferdishenko, in fact!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course you have given me a disagreeable enough thing to think\\r\\nabout,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, irritably, â\\x80\\x9cbut what are you going to do,\\r\\nsince you are so sure it was Ferdishenko?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut who else _could_ it be, my very dear prince?â\\x80\\x9d repeated Lebedeff,\\r\\nas sweet as sugar again. â\\x80\\x9cIf you donâ\\x80\\x99t wish me to suspect Mr.\\r\\nBurdovsky?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course not.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNor the general? Ha, ha, ha!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNonsense!â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, angrily, turning round upon him.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuite so, nonsense! Ha, ha, ha! dear me! He did amuse me, did the\\r\\ngeneral! We went off on the hot scent to Wilkinâ\\x80\\x99s together, you know;\\r\\nbut I must first observe that the general was even more thunderstruck\\r\\nthan I myself this morning, when I awoke him after discovering the\\r\\ntheft; so much so that his very face changedâ\\x80\\x94he grew red and then pale,\\r\\nand at length flew into a paroxysm of such noble wrath that I assure\\r\\nyou I was quite surprised! He is a most generous-hearted man! He tells\\r\\nlies by the thousands, I know, but it is merely a weakness; he is a man\\r\\nof the highest feelings; a simple-minded man too, and a man who carries\\r\\nthe conviction of innocence in his very appearance. I love that man,\\r\\nsir; I may have told you so before; it is a weakness of mine. Wellâ\\x80\\x94he\\r\\nsuddenly stopped in the middle of the road, opened out his coat and\\r\\nbared his breast. â\\x80\\x98Search me,â\\x80\\x99 he says, â\\x80\\x98you searched Keller; why donâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nyou search me too? It is only fair!â\\x80\\x99 says he. And all the while his\\r\\nlegs and hands were trembling with anger, and he as white as a sheet\\r\\nall over! So I said to him, â\\x80\\x98Nonsense, general; if anybody but yourself\\r\\nhad said that to me, Iâ\\x80\\x99d have taken my head, my own head, and put it on\\r\\na large dish and carried it round to anyone who suspected you; and I\\r\\nshould have said: â\\x80\\x9cThere, you see that head? Itâ\\x80\\x99s my head, and Iâ\\x80\\x99ll go\\r\\nbail with that head for him! Yes, and walk through the fire for him,\\r\\ntoo.â\\x80\\x9d There,â\\x80\\x99 says I, â\\x80\\x98thatâ\\x80\\x99s how Iâ\\x80\\x99d answer for you, general!â\\x80\\x99 Then he\\r\\nembraced me, in the middle of the street, and hugged me so tight\\r\\n(crying over me all the while) that I coughed fit to choke! â\\x80\\x98You are\\r\\nthe one friend left to me amid all my misfortunes,â\\x80\\x99 says he. Oh, heâ\\x80\\x99s a\\r\\nman of sentiment, that! He went on to tell me a story of how he had\\r\\nbeen accused, or suspected, of stealing five hundred thousand roubles\\r\\nonce, as a young man; and how, the very next day, he had rushed into a\\r\\nburning, blazing house and saved the very count who suspected him, and\\r\\nNina Alexandrovna (who was then a young girl), from a fiery death. The\\r\\ncount embraced him, and that was how he came to marry Nina\\r\\nAlexandrovna, he said. As for the money, it was found among the ruins\\r\\nnext day in an English iron box with a secret lock; it had got under\\r\\nthe floor somehow, and if it had not been for the fire it would never\\r\\nhave been found! The whole thing is, of course, an absolute\\r\\nfabrication, though when he spoke of Nina Alexandrovna he wept! Sheâ\\x80\\x99s a\\r\\ngrand woman, is Nina Alexandrovna, though she is very angry with me!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAre you acquainted with her?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, hardly at all. I wish I were, if only for the sake of justifying\\r\\nmyself in her eyes. Nina Alexandrovna has a grudge against me for, as\\r\\nshe thinks, encouraging her husband in drinking; whereas in reality I\\r\\nnot only do not encourage him, but I actually keep him out of harmâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nway, and out of bad company. Besides, heâ\\x80\\x99s my friend, prince, so that I\\r\\nshall not lose sight of him, again. Where he goes, I go. Heâ\\x80\\x99s quite\\r\\ngiven up visiting the captainâ\\x80\\x99s widow, though sometimes he thinks sadly\\r\\nof her, especially in the morning, when heâ\\x80\\x99s putting on his boots. I\\r\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t know why itâ\\x80\\x99s at that time. But he has no money, and itâ\\x80\\x99s no use\\r\\nhis going to see her without. Has he borrowed any money from you,\\r\\nprince?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, he has not.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, heâ\\x80\\x99s ashamed to! He _meant_ to ask you, I know, for he said so. I\\r\\nsuppose he thinks that as you gave him some once (you remember), you\\r\\nwould probably refuse if he asked you again.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you ever give him money?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPrince! Money! Why I would give that man not only my money, but my\\r\\nvery life, if he wanted it. Well, perhaps thatâ\\x80\\x99s exaggeration; not\\r\\nlife, weâ\\x80\\x99ll say, but some illness, a boil or a bad cough, or anything\\r\\nof that sort, I would stand with pleasure, for his sake; for I consider\\r\\nhim a great man fallenâ\\x80\\x94money, indeed!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHâ\\x80\\x99m, then you _do_ give him money?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cN-no, I have never given him money, and he knows well that I will\\r\\nnever give him any; because I am anxious to keep him out of intemperate\\r\\nways. He is going to town with me now; for you must know I am off to\\r\\nPetersburg after Ferdishenko, while the scent is hot; Iâ\\x80\\x99m certain he is\\r\\nthere. I shall let the general go one way, while I go the other; we\\r\\nhave so arranged matters in order to pop out upon Ferdishenko, you see,\\r\\nfrom different sides. But I am going to follow that naughty old general\\r\\nand catch him, I know where, at a certain widowâ\\x80\\x99s house; for I think it\\r\\nwill be a good lesson, to put him to shame by catching him with the\\r\\nwidow.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, Lebedeff, donâ\\x80\\x99t, donâ\\x80\\x99t make any scandal about it!â\\x80\\x9d said the\\r\\nprince, much agitated, and speaking in a low voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot for the world, not for the world! I merely wish to make him\\r\\nashamed of himself. Oh, prince, great though this misfortune be to\\r\\nmyself, I cannot help thinking of his morals! I have a great favour to\\r\\nask of you, esteemed prince; I confess that it is the chief object of\\r\\nmy visit. You know the Ivolgins, you have even lived in their house; so\\r\\nif you would lend me your help, honoured prince, in the generalâ\\x80\\x99s own\\r\\ninterest and for his good.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLebedeff clasped his hands in supplication.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat help do you want from me? You may be certain that I am most\\r\\nanxious to understand you, Lebedeff.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI felt sure of that, or I should not have come to you. We might manage\\r\\nit with the help of Nina Alexandrovna, so that he might be closely\\r\\nwatched in his own house. Unfortunately I am not on terms...\\r\\notherwise... but Nicolai Ardalionovitch, who adores you with all his\\r\\nyouthful soul, might help, too.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, no! Heaven forbid that we should bring Nina Alexandrovna into this\\r\\nbusiness! Or Colia, either. But perhaps I have not yet quite understood\\r\\nyou, Lebedeff?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLebedeff made an impatient movement.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut there is nothing to understand! Sympathy and tenderness, that is\\r\\nallâ\\x80\\x94that is all our poor invalid requires! You will permit me to\\r\\nconsider him an invalid?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, it shows delicacy and intelligence on your part.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI will explain my idea by a practical example, to make it clearer. You\\r\\nknow the sort of man he is. At present his only failing is that he is\\r\\ncrazy about that captainâ\\x80\\x99s widow, and he cannot go to her without\\r\\nmoney, and I mean to catch him at her house todayâ\\x80\\x94for his own good; but\\r\\nsupposing it was not only the widow, but that he had committed a real\\r\\ncrime, or at least some very dishonourable action (of which he is, of\\r\\ncourse, incapable), I repeat that even in that case, if he were treated\\r\\nwith what I may call generous tenderness, one could get at the whole\\r\\ntruth, for he is very soft-hearted! Believe me, he would betray himself\\r\\nbefore five days were out; he would burst into tears, and make a clean\\r\\nbreast of the matter; especially if managed with tact, and if you and\\r\\nhis family watched his every step, so to speak. Oh, my dear prince,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nLebedeff added most emphatically, â\\x80\\x9cI do not positively assert that he\\r\\nhas... I am ready, as the saying is, to shed my last drop of blood for\\r\\nhim this instant; but you will admit that debauchery, drunkenness, and\\r\\nthe captainâ\\x80\\x99s widow, all these together may lead him very far.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am, of course, quite ready to add my efforts to yours in such a\\r\\ncase,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, rising; â\\x80\\x9cbut I confess, Lebedeff, that I am\\r\\nterribly perplexed. Tell me, do you still think... plainly, you say\\r\\nyourself that you suspect Mr. Ferdishenko?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLebedeff clasped his hands once more.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, who else could I possibly suspect? Who else, most outspoken\\r\\nprince?â\\x80\\x9d he replied, with an unctuous smile.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuishkin frowned, and rose from his seat.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou see, Lebedeff, a mistake here would be a dreadful thing. This\\r\\nFerdishenko, I would not say a word against him, of course; but, who\\r\\nknows? Perhaps it really was he? I mean he really does seem to be a\\r\\nmore likely man than... than any other.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLebedeff strained his eyes and ears to take in what the prince was\\r\\nsaying. The latter was frowning more and more, and walking excitedly up\\r\\nand down, trying not to look at Lebedeff.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou see,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cI was given to understand that Ferdishenko was\\r\\nthat sort of man,â\\x80\\x94that one canâ\\x80\\x99t say everything before him. One has to\\r\\ntake care not to say too much, you understand? I say this to prove that\\r\\nhe really is, so to speak, more likely to have done this than anyone\\r\\nelse, eh? You understand? The important thing is, not to make a\\r\\nmistake.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd who told you this about Ferdishenko?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, I was told. Of course I donâ\\x80\\x99t altogether believe it. I am very\\r\\nsorry that I should have had to say this, because I assure you I donâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nbelieve it myself; it is all nonsense, of course. It was stupid of me\\r\\nto say anything about it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou see, it is very important, it is most important to know where you\\r\\ngot this report from,â\\x80\\x9d said Lebedeff, excitedly. He had risen from his\\r\\nseat, and was trying to keep step with the prince, running after him,\\r\\nup and down. â\\x80\\x9cBecause look here, prince, I donâ\\x80\\x99t mind telling you now\\r\\nthat as we were going along to Wilkinâ\\x80\\x99s this morning, after telling me\\r\\nwhat you know about the fire, and saving the count and all that, the\\r\\ngeneral was pleased to drop certain hints to the same effect about\\r\\nFerdishenko, but so vaguely and clumsily that I thought better to put a\\r\\nfew questions to him on the matter, with the result that I found the\\r\\nwhole thing was an invention of his excellencyâ\\x80\\x99s own mind. Of course,\\r\\nhe only lies with the best intentions; still, he lies. But, such being\\r\\nthe case, where could you have heard the same report? It was the\\r\\ninspiration of the moment with him, you understand, so who could have\\r\\ntold _you?_ It is an important question, you see!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was Colia told me, and his father told _him_ at about six this\\r\\nmorning. They met at the threshold, when Colia was leaving the room for\\r\\nsomething or other.â\\x80\\x9d The prince told Lebedeff all that Colia had made\\r\\nknown to himself, in detail.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere now, thatâ\\x80\\x99s what we may call _scent!_â\\x80\\x9d said Lebedeff, rubbing\\r\\nhis hands and laughing silently. â\\x80\\x9cI thought it must be so, you see. The\\r\\ngeneral interrupted his innocent slumbers, at six oâ\\x80\\x99clock, in order to\\r\\ngo and wake his beloved son, and warn him of the dreadful danger of\\r\\ncompanionship with Ferdishenko. Dear me! what a dreadfully dangerous\\r\\nman Ferdishenko must be, and what touching paternal solicitude, on the\\r\\npart of his excellency, ha! ha! ha!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cListen, Lebedeff,â\\x80\\x9d began the prince, quite overwhelmed; â\\x80\\x9c_do_ act\\r\\nquietlyâ\\x80\\x94donâ\\x80\\x99t make a scandal, Lebedeff, I ask youâ\\x80\\x94I entreat you! No one\\r\\nmust knowâ\\x80\\x94_no one_, mind! In that case only, I will help you.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBe assured, most honourable, most worthy of princesâ\\x80\\x94be assured that\\r\\nthe whole matter shall be buried within my heart!â\\x80\\x9d cried Lebedeff, in a\\r\\nparoxysm of exaltation. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99d give every drop of my blood... Illustrious\\r\\nprince, I am a poor wretch in soul and spirit, but ask the veriest\\r\\nscoundrel whether he would prefer to deal with one like himself, or\\r\\nwith a noble-hearted man like you, and there is no doubt as to his\\r\\nchoice! Heâ\\x80\\x99ll answer that he prefers the noble-hearted manâ\\x80\\x94and there\\r\\nyou have the triumph of virtue! _Au revoir_, honoured prince! You and I\\r\\ntogetherâ\\x80\\x94softly! softly!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nX.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince understood at last why he shivered with dread every time he\\r\\nthought of the three letters in his pocket, and why he had put off\\r\\nreading them until the evening.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he fell into a heavy sleep on the sofa on the verandah, without\\r\\nhaving had the courage to open a single one of the three envelopes, he\\r\\nagain dreamed a painful dream, and once more that poor, â\\x80\\x9csinfulâ\\x80\\x9d woman\\r\\nappeared to him. Again she gazed at him with tears sparkling on her\\r\\nlong lashes, and beckoned him after her; and again he awoke, as before,\\r\\nwith the picture of her face haunting him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe longed to get up and go to her at onceâ\\x80\\x94but he _could not_. At\\r\\nlength, almost in despair, he unfolded the letters, and began to read\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese letters, too, were like a dream. We sometimes have strange,\\r\\nimpossible dreams, contrary to all the laws of nature. When we awake we\\r\\nremember them and wonder at their strangeness. You remember, perhaps,\\r\\nthat you were in full possession of your reason during this succession\\r\\nof fantastic images; even that you acted with extraordinary logic and\\r\\ncunning while surrounded by murderers who hid their intentions and made\\r\\ngreat demonstrations of friendship, while waiting for an opportunity to\\r\\ncut your throat. You remember how you escaped them by some ingenious\\r\\nstratagem; then you doubted if they were really deceived, or whether\\r\\nthey were only pretending not to know your hiding-place; then you\\r\\nthought of another plan and hoodwinked them once again. You remember\\r\\nall this quite clearly, but how is it that your reason calmly accepted\\r\\nall the manifest absurdities and impossibilities that crowded into your\\r\\ndream? One of the murderers suddenly changed into a woman before your\\r\\nvery eyes; then the woman was transformed into a hideous, cunning\\r\\nlittle dwarf; and you believed it, and accepted it all almost as a\\r\\nmatter of courseâ\\x80\\x94while at the same time your intelligence seemed\\r\\nunusually keen, and accomplished miracles of cunning, sagacity, and\\r\\nlogic! Why is it that when you awake to the world of realities you\\r\\nnearly always feel, sometimes very vividly, that the vanished dream has\\r\\ncarried with it some enigma which you have failed to solve? You smile\\r\\nat the extravagance of your dream, and yet you feel that this tissue of\\r\\nabsurdity contained some real idea, something that belongs to your true\\r\\nlife,â\\x80\\x94something that exists, and has always existed, in your heart. You\\r\\nsearch your dream for some prophecy that you were expecting. It has\\r\\nleft a deep impression upon you, joyful or cruel, but what it means, or\\r\\nwhat has been predicted to you in it, you can neither understand nor\\r\\nremember.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reading of these letters produced some such effect upon the prince.\\r\\nHe felt, before he even opened the envelopes, that the very fact of\\r\\ntheir existence was like a nightmare. How could she ever have made up\\r\\nher mind to write to her? he asked himself. How could she write about\\r\\nthat at all? And how could such a wild idea have entered her head? And\\r\\nyet, the strangest part of the matter was, that while he read the\\r\\nletters, he himself almost believed in the possibility, and even in the\\r\\njustification, of the idea he had thought so wild. Of course it was a\\r\\nmad dream, a nightmare, and yet there was something cruelly real about\\r\\nit. For hours he was haunted by what he had read. Several passages\\r\\nreturned again and again to his mind, and as he brooded over them, he\\r\\nfelt inclined to say to himself that he had foreseen and known all that\\r\\nwas written here; it even seemed to him that he had read the whole of\\r\\nthis some time or other, long, long ago; and all that had tormented and\\r\\ngrieved him up to now was to be found in these old, long since read,\\r\\nletters.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen you open this letterâ\\x80\\x9d (so the first began), â\\x80\\x9clook first at the\\r\\nsignature. The signature will tell you all, so that I need explain\\r\\nnothing, nor attempt to justify myself. Were I in any way on a footing\\r\\nwith you, you might be offended at my audacity; but who am I, and who\\r\\nare you? We are at such extremes, and I am so far removed from you,\\r\\nthat I could not offend you if I wished to do so.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFarther on, in another place, she wrote: â\\x80\\x9cDo not consider my words as\\r\\nthe sickly ecstasies of a diseased mind, but you are, in my\\r\\nopinionâ\\x80\\x94perfection! I have seen youâ\\x80\\x94I see you every day. I do not judge\\r\\nyou; I have not weighed you in the scales of Reason and found you\\r\\nPerfectionâ\\x80\\x94it is simply an article of faith. But I must confess one sin\\r\\nagainst youâ\\x80\\x94I love you. One should not love perfection. One should only\\r\\nlook on it as perfectionâ\\x80\\x94yet I am in love with you. Though love\\r\\nequalizes, do not fear. I have not lowered you to my level, even in my\\r\\nmost secret thoughts. I have written â\\x80\\x98Do not fear,â\\x80\\x99 as if you could\\r\\nfear. I would kiss your footprints if I could; but, oh! I am not\\r\\nputting myself on a level with you!â\\x80\\x94Look at the signatureâ\\x80\\x94quick, look\\r\\nat the signature!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHowever, observeâ\\x80\\x9d (she wrote in another of the letters), â\\x80\\x9cthat\\r\\nalthough I couple you with him, yet I have not once asked you whether\\r\\nyou love him. He fell in love with you, though he saw you but once. He\\r\\nspoke of you as of â\\x80\\x98the light.â\\x80\\x99 These are his own wordsâ\\x80\\x94I heard him use\\r\\nthem. But I understood without his saying it that you were all that\\r\\nlight is to him. I lived near him for a whole month, and I understood\\r\\nthen that you, too, must love him. I think of you and him as one.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat was the matter yesterday?â\\x80\\x9d (she wrote on another sheet). â\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\npassed by you, and you seemed to me to _blush_. Perhaps it was only my\\r\\nfancy. If I were to bring you to the most loathsome den, and show you\\r\\nthe revelation of undisguised viceâ\\x80\\x94you should not blush. You can never\\r\\nfeel the sense of personal affront. You may hate all who are mean, or\\r\\nbase, or unworthyâ\\x80\\x94but not for yourselfâ\\x80\\x94only for those whom they wrong.\\r\\nNo one can wrong _you_. Do you know, I think you ought to love meâ\\x80\\x94for\\r\\nyou are the same in my eyes as in hisâ\\x80\\x94you are as light. An angel cannot\\r\\nhate, perhaps cannot love, either. I often ask myselfâ\\x80\\x94is it possible to\\r\\nlove everybody? Indeed it is not; it is not in nature. Abstract love of\\r\\nhumanity is nearly always love of self. But you are different. You\\r\\ncannot help loving all, since you can compare with none, and are above\\r\\nall personal offence or anger. Oh! how bitter it would be to me to know\\r\\nthat you felt anger or shame on my account, for that would be your\\r\\nfallâ\\x80\\x94you would become comparable at once with such as me.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYesterday, after seeing you, I went home and thought out a picture.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cArtists always draw the Saviour as an actor in one of the Gospel\\r\\nstories. I should do differently. I should represent Christ aloneâ\\x80\\x94the\\r\\ndisciples did leave Him alone occasionally. I should paint one little\\r\\nchild left with Him. This child has been playing about near Him, and\\r\\nhad probably just been telling the Saviour something in its pretty baby\\r\\nprattle. Christ had listened to it, but was now musingâ\\x80\\x94one hand\\r\\nreposing on the childâ\\x80\\x99s bright head. His eyes have a far-away\\r\\nexpression. Thought, great as the Universe, is in themâ\\x80\\x94His face is sad.\\r\\nThe little one leans its elbow upon Christâ\\x80\\x99s knee, and with its cheek\\r\\nresting on its hand, gazes up at Him, pondering as children sometimes\\r\\ndo ponder. The sun is setting. There you have my picture.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are innocentâ\\x80\\x94and in your innocence lies all your perfectionâ\\x80\\x94oh,\\r\\nremember that! What is my passion to you?â\\x80\\x94you are mine now; I shall be\\r\\nnear you all my lifeâ\\x80\\x94I shall not live long!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length, in the last letter of all, he found:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFor Heavenâ\\x80\\x99s sake, donâ\\x80\\x99t misunderstand me! Do not think that I\\r\\nhumiliate myself by writing thus to you, or that I belong to that class\\r\\nof people who take a satisfaction in humiliating themselvesâ\\x80\\x94from pride.\\r\\nI have my consolation, though it would be difficult to explain itâ\\x80\\x94but I\\r\\ndo not humiliate myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy do I wish to unite you two? For your sakes or my own? For my own\\r\\nsake, naturally. All the problems of my life would thus be solved; I\\r\\nhave thought so for a long time. I know that once when your sister\\r\\nAdelaida saw my portrait she said that such beauty could overthrow the\\r\\nworld. But I have renounced the world. You think it strange that I\\r\\nshould say so, for you saw me decked with lace and diamonds, in the\\r\\ncompany of drunkards and wastrels. Take no notice of that; I know that\\r\\nI have almost ceased to exist. God knows what it is dwelling within me\\r\\nnowâ\\x80\\x94it is not myself. I can see it every day in two dreadful eyes which\\r\\nare always looking at me, even when not present. These eyes are silent\\r\\nnow, they say nothing; but I know their secret. His house is gloomy,\\r\\nand there is a secret in it. I am convinced that in some box he has a\\r\\nrazor hidden, tied round with silk, just like the one that Moscow\\r\\nmurderer had. This man also lived with his mother, and had a razor\\r\\nhidden away, tied round with white silk, and with this razor he\\r\\nintended to cut a throat.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAll the while I was in their house I felt sure that somewhere beneath\\r\\nthe floor there was hidden away some dreadful corpse, wrapped in\\r\\noil-cloth, perhaps buried there by his father, who knows? Just as in\\r\\nthe Moscow case. I could have shown you the very spot!\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe is always silent, but I know well that he loves me so much that he\\r\\nmust hate me. My wedding and yours are to be on the same day; so I have\\r\\narranged with him. I have no secrets from him. I would kill him from\\r\\nvery fright, but he will kill me first. He has just burst out laughing,\\r\\nand says that I am raving. He knows I am writing to you.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was much more of this delirious wandering in the lettersâ\\x80\\x94one of\\r\\nthem was very long.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last the prince came out of the dark, gloomy park, in which he had\\r\\nwandered about for hours just as yesterday. The bright night seemed to\\r\\nhim to be lighter than ever. â\\x80\\x9cIt must be quite early,â\\x80\\x9d he thought. (He\\r\\nhad forgotten his watch.) There was a sound of distant music somewhere.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh,â\\x80\\x9d he thought, â\\x80\\x9cthe Vauxhall! They wonâ\\x80\\x99t be there today, of course!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nAt this moment he noticed that he was close to their house; he had felt\\r\\nthat he must gravitate to this spot eventually, and, with a beating\\r\\nheart, he mounted the verandah steps.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one met him; the verandah was empty, and nearly pitch dark. He\\r\\nopened the door into the room, but it, too, was dark and empty. He\\r\\nstood in the middle of the room in perplexity. Suddenly the door\\r\\nopened, and in came Alexandra, candle in hand. Seeing the prince she\\r\\nstopped before him in surprise, looking at him questioningly.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was clear that she had been merely passing through the room from\\r\\ndoor to door, and had not had the remotest notion that she would meet\\r\\nanyone.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow did you come here?â\\x80\\x9d she asked, at last.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x94Iâ\\x80\\x94came inâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMamma is not very well, nor is Aglaya. Adelaida has gone to bed, and I\\r\\nam just going. We were alone the whole evening. Father and Prince S.\\r\\nhave gone to town.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have come to youâ\\x80\\x94nowâ\\x80\\x94toâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you know what time it is?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNâ\\x80\\x94no!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHalf-past twelve. We are always in bed by one.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x94I thought it was half-past nine!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNever mind!â\\x80\\x9d she laughed, â\\x80\\x9cbut why didnâ\\x80\\x99t you come earlier? Perhaps\\r\\nyou were expected!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI thoughtâ\\x80\\x9d he stammered, making for the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Au revoir!_ I shall amuse them all with this story tomorrow!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe walked along the road towards his own house. His heart was beating,\\r\\nhis thoughts were confused, everything around seemed to be part of a\\r\\ndream.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd suddenly, just as twice already he had awaked from sleep with the\\r\\nsame vision, that very apparition now seemed to rise up before him. The\\r\\nwoman appeared to step out from the park, and stand in the path in\\r\\nfront of him, as though she had been waiting for him there.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shuddered and stopped; she seized his hand and pressed it\\r\\nfrenziedly.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo, this was no apparition!\\r\\n\\r\\nThere she stood at last, face to face with him, for the first time\\r\\nsince their parting.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe said something, but he looked silently back at her. His heart ached\\r\\nwith anguish. Oh! never would he banish the recollection of this\\r\\nmeeting with her, and he never remembered it but with the same pain and\\r\\nagony of mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe went on her knees before himâ\\x80\\x94there in the open roadâ\\x80\\x94like a\\r\\nmadwoman. He retreated a step, but she caught his hand and kissed it,\\r\\nand, just as in his dream, the tears were sparkling on her long,\\r\\nbeautiful lashes.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGet up!â\\x80\\x9d he said, in a frightened whisper, raising her. â\\x80\\x9cGet up at\\r\\nonce!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAre you happyâ\\x80\\x94are you happy?â\\x80\\x9d she asked. â\\x80\\x9cSay this one word. Are you\\r\\nhappy now? Today, this moment? Have you just been with her? What did\\r\\nshe say?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe did not rise from her knees; she would not listen to him; she put\\r\\nher questions hurriedly, as though she were pursued.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am going away tomorrow, as you bade meâ\\x80\\x94I wonâ\\x80\\x99t writeâ\\x80\\x94so that this is\\r\\nthe last time I shall see you, the last time! This is really the _last\\r\\ntime!_â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, be calmâ\\x80\\x94be calm! Get up!â\\x80\\x9d he entreated, in despair.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe gazed thirstily at him and clutched his hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood-bye!â\\x80\\x9d she said at last, and rose and left him, very quickly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince noticed that Rogojin had suddenly appeared at her side, and\\r\\nhad taken her arm and was leading her away.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWait a minute, prince,â\\x80\\x9d shouted the latter, as he went. â\\x80\\x9cI shall be\\r\\nback in five minutes.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe reappeared in five minutes as he had said. The prince was waiting\\r\\nfor him.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve put her in the carriage,â\\x80\\x9d he said; â\\x80\\x9cit has been waiting round the\\r\\ncorner there since ten oâ\\x80\\x99clock. She expected that you would be with\\r\\n_them_ all the evening. I told her exactly what you wrote me. She wonâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nwrite to the girl any more, she promises; and tomorrow she will be off,\\r\\nas you wish. She desired to see you for the last time, although you\\r\\nrefused, so weâ\\x80\\x99ve been sitting and waiting on that bench till you\\r\\nshould pass on your way home.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDid she bring you with her of her own accord?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course she did!â\\x80\\x9d said Rogojin, showing his teeth; â\\x80\\x9cand I saw for\\r\\nmyself what I knew before. Youâ\\x80\\x99ve read her letters, I suppose?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDid you read them?â\\x80\\x9d asked the prince, struck by the thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf courseâ\\x80\\x94she showed them to me herself. You are thinking of the\\r\\nrazor, eh? Ha, ha, ha!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, she is mad!â\\x80\\x9d cried the prince, wringing his hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWho knows? Perhaps she is not so mad after all,â\\x80\\x9d said Rogojin, softly,\\r\\nas though thinking aloud.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince made no reply.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, good-bye,â\\x80\\x9d said Rogojin. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m off tomorrow too, you know.\\r\\nRemember me kindly! By-the-by,â\\x80\\x9d he added, turning round sharply again,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdid you answer her question just now? Are you happy, or not?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, no, no!â\\x80\\x9d cried the prince, with unspeakable sadness.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHa, ha! I never supposed you would say â\\x80\\x98yes,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d cried Rogojin, laughing\\r\\nsardonically.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he disappeared, without looking round again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPART IV\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI.\\r\\n\\r\\nA week had elapsed since the rendezvous of our two friends on the green\\r\\nbench in the park, when, one fine morning at about half-past ten\\r\\noâ\\x80\\x99clock, Varvara Ardalionovna, otherwise Mrs. Ptitsin, who had been out\\r\\nto visit a friend, returned home in a state of considerable mental\\r\\ndepression.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are certain people of whom it is difficult to say anything which\\r\\nwill at once throw them into reliefâ\\x80\\x94in other words, describe them\\r\\ngraphically in their typical characteristics. These are they who are\\r\\ngenerally known as â\\x80\\x9ccommonplace people,â\\x80\\x9d and this class comprises, of\\r\\ncourse, the immense majority of mankind. Authors, as a rule, attempt to\\r\\nselect and portray types rarely met with in their entirety, but these\\r\\ntypes are nevertheless more real than real life itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPodkoleosinâ\\x80\\x9d [A character in Gogolâ\\x80\\x99s comedy, The Wedding.] was perhaps\\r\\nan exaggeration, but he was by no means a non-existent character; on\\r\\nthe contrary, how many intelligent people, after hearing of this\\r\\nPodkoleosin from Gogol, immediately began to find that scores of their\\r\\nfriends were exactly like him! They knew, perhaps, before Gogol told\\r\\nthem, that their friends were like Podkoleosin, but they did not know\\r\\nwhat name to give them. In real life, young fellows seldom jump out of\\r\\nthe window just before their weddings, because such a feat, not to\\r\\nspeak of its other aspects, must be a decidedly unpleasant mode of\\r\\nescape; and yet there are plenty of bridegrooms, intelligent fellows\\r\\ntoo, who would be ready to confess themselves Podkoleosins in the\\r\\ndepths of their consciousness, just before marriage. Nor does every\\r\\nhusband feel bound to repeat at every step, â\\x80\\x9c_Tu lâ\\x80\\x99as voulu, Georges\\r\\nDandin!_â\\x80\\x9d like another typical personage; and yet how many millions and\\r\\nbillions of Georges Dandins there are in real life who feel inclined to\\r\\nutter this soul-drawn cry after their honeymoon, if not the day after\\r\\nthe wedding! Therefore, without entering into any more serious\\r\\nexamination of the question, I will content myself with remarking that\\r\\nin real life typical characters are â\\x80\\x9cwatered down,â\\x80\\x9d so to speak; and\\r\\nall these Dandins and Podkoleosins actually exist among us every day,\\r\\nbut in a diluted form. I will just add, however, that Georges Dandin\\r\\nmight have existed exactly as MoliÃ¨re presented him, and probably does\\r\\nexist now and then, though rarely; and so I will end this scientific\\r\\nexamination, which is beginning to look like a newspaper criticism. But\\r\\nfor all this, the question remains,â\\x80\\x94what are the novelists to do with\\r\\ncommonplace people, and how are they to be presented to the reader in\\r\\nsuch a form as to be in the least degree interesting? They cannot be\\r\\nleft out altogether, for commonplace people meet one at every turn of\\r\\nlife, and to leave them out would be to destroy the whole reality and\\r\\nprobability of the story. To fill a novel with typical characters only,\\r\\nor with merely strange and uncommon people, would render the book\\r\\nunreal and improbable, and would very likely destroy the interest. In\\r\\nmy opinion, the duty of the novelist is to seek out points of interest\\r\\nand instruction even in the characters of commonplace people.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor instance, when the whole essence of an ordinary personâ\\x80\\x99s nature\\r\\nlies in his perpetual and unchangeable commonplaceness; and when in\\r\\nspite of all his endeavours to do something out of the common, this\\r\\nperson ends, eventually, by remaining in his unbroken line of routineâ\\x80\\x94.\\r\\nI think such an individual really does become a type of his ownâ\\x80\\x94a type\\r\\nof commonplaceness which will not for the world, if it can help it, be\\r\\ncontented, but strains and yearns to be something original and\\r\\nindependent, without the slightest possibility of being so. To this\\r\\nclass of commonplace people belong several characters in this\\r\\nnovel;â\\x80\\x94characters whichâ\\x80\\x94I admitâ\\x80\\x94I have not drawn very vividly up to now\\r\\nfor my readerâ\\x80\\x99s benefit.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch were, for instance, Varvara Ardalionovna Ptitsin, her husband, and\\r\\nher brother, Gania.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is nothing so annoying as to be fairly rich, of a fairly good\\r\\nfamily, pleasing presence, average education, to be â\\x80\\x9cnot stupid,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nkind-hearted, and yet to have no talent at all, no originality, not a\\r\\nsingle idea of oneâ\\x80\\x99s ownâ\\x80\\x94to be, in fact, â\\x80\\x9cjust like everyone else.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOf such people there are countless numbers in this worldâ\\x80\\x94far more even\\r\\nthan appear. They can be divided into two classes as all men canâ\\x80\\x94that\\r\\nis, those of limited intellect, and those who are much cleverer. The\\r\\nformer of these classes is the happier.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo a commonplace man of limited intellect, for instance, nothing is\\r\\nsimpler than to imagine himself an original character, and to revel in\\r\\nthat belief without the slightest misgiving.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of our young women have thought fit to cut their hair short, put\\r\\non blue spectacles, and call themselves Nihilists. By doing this they\\r\\nhave been able to persuade themselves, without further trouble, that\\r\\nthey have acquired new convictions of their own. Some men have but felt\\r\\nsome little qualm of kindness towards their fellow-men, and the fact\\r\\nhas been quite enough to persuade them that they stand alone in the van\\r\\nof enlightenment and that no one has such humanitarian feelings as\\r\\nthey. Others have but to read an idea of somebody elseâ\\x80\\x99s, and they can\\r\\nimmediately assimilate it and believe that it was a child of their own\\r\\nbrain. The â\\x80\\x9cimpudence of ignorance,â\\x80\\x9d if I may use the expression, is\\r\\ndeveloped to a wonderful extent in such cases;â\\x80\\x94unlikely as it appears,\\r\\nit is met with at every turn.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis confidence of a stupid man in his own talents has been wonderfully\\r\\ndepicted by Gogol in the amazing character of Pirogoff. Pirogoff has\\r\\nnot the slightest doubt of his own genius,â\\x80\\x94nay, of his _superiority_ of\\r\\ngenius,â\\x80\\x94so certain is he of it that he never questions it. How many\\r\\nPirogoffs have there not been among our writersâ\\x80\\x94scholars,\\r\\npropagandists? I say â\\x80\\x9chave been,â\\x80\\x9d but indeed there are plenty of them\\r\\nat this very day.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur friend, Gania, belonged to the other classâ\\x80\\x94to the â\\x80\\x9cmuch clevererâ\\x80\\x9d\\r\\npersons, though he was from head to foot permeated and saturated with\\r\\nthe longing to be original. This class, as I have said above, is far\\r\\nless happy. For the â\\x80\\x9cclever commonplaceâ\\x80\\x9d person, though he may possibly\\r\\nimagine himself a man of genius and originality, none the less has\\r\\nwithin his heart the deathless worm of suspicion and doubt; and this\\r\\ndoubt sometimes brings a clever man to despair. (As a rule, however,\\r\\nnothing tragic happens;â\\x80\\x94his liver becomes a little damaged in the\\r\\ncourse of time, nothing more serious. Such men do not give up their\\r\\naspirations after originality without a severe struggle,â\\x80\\x94and there have\\r\\nbeen men who, though good fellows in themselves, and even benefactors\\r\\nto humanity, have sunk to the level of base criminals for the sake of\\r\\noriginality).\\r\\n\\r\\nGania was a beginner, as it were, upon this road. A deep and\\r\\nunchangeable consciousness of his own lack of talent, combined with a\\r\\nvast longing to be able to persuade himself that he was original, had\\r\\nrankled in his heart, even from childhood.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe seemed to have been born with overwrought nerves, and in his\\r\\npassionate desire to excel, he was often led to the brink of some rash\\r\\nstep; and yet, having resolved upon such a step, when the moment\\r\\narrived, he invariably proved too sensible to take it. He was ready, in\\r\\nthe same way, to do a base action in order to obtain his wished-for\\r\\nobject; and yet, when the moment came to do it, he found that he was\\r\\ntoo honest for any great baseness. (Not that he objected to acts of\\r\\npetty meannessâ\\x80\\x94he was always ready for _them_.) He looked with hate and\\r\\nloathing on the poverty and downfall of his family, and treated his\\r\\nmother with haughty contempt, although he knew that his whole future\\r\\ndepended on her character and reputation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAglaya had simply frightened him; yet he did not give up all thoughts\\r\\nof herâ\\x80\\x94though he never seriously hoped that she would condescend to\\r\\nhim. At the time of his â\\x80\\x9cadventureâ\\x80\\x9d with Nastasia Philipovna he had\\r\\ncome to the conclusion that money was his only hopeâ\\x80\\x94money should do all\\r\\nfor him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the moment when he lost Aglaya, and after the scene with Nastasia,\\r\\nhe had felt so low in his own eyes that he actually brought the money\\r\\nback to the prince. Of this returning of the money given to him by a\\r\\nmadwoman who had received it from a madman, he had often repented\\r\\nsinceâ\\x80\\x94though he never ceased to be proud of his action. During the\\r\\nshort time that Muishkin remained in Petersburg Gania had had time to\\r\\ncome to hate him for his sympathy, though the prince told him that it\\r\\nwas â\\x80\\x9cnot everyone who would have acted so noblyâ\\x80\\x9d as to return the\\r\\nmoney. He had long pondered, too, over his relations with Aglaya, and\\r\\nhad persuaded himself that with such a strange, childish, innocent\\r\\ncharacter as hers, things might have ended very differently. Remorse\\r\\nthen seized him; he threw up his post, and buried himself in\\r\\nself-torment and reproach.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe lived at Ptitsinâ\\x80\\x99s, and openly showed contempt for the latter,\\r\\nthough he always listened to his advice, and was sensible enough to ask\\r\\nfor it when he wanted it. Gavrila Ardalionovitch was angry with Ptitsin\\r\\nbecause the latter did not care to become a Rothschild. â\\x80\\x9cIf you are to\\r\\nbe a Jew,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cdo it properlyâ\\x80\\x94squeeze people right and left, show\\r\\nsome character; be the King of the Jews while you are about it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPtitsin was quiet and not easily offendedâ\\x80\\x94he only laughed. But on one\\r\\noccasion he explained seriously to Gania that he was no Jew, that he\\r\\ndid nothing dishonest, that he could not help the market price of\\r\\nmoney, that, thanks to his accurate habits, he had already a good\\r\\nfooting and was respected, and that his business was flourishing.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI shanâ\\x80\\x99t ever be a Rothschild, and there is no reason why I should,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nhe added, smiling; â\\x80\\x9cbut I shall have a house in the Liteynaya, perhaps\\r\\ntwo, and that will be enough for me.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWho knows but what I may have\\r\\nthree!â\\x80\\x9d he concluded to himself; but this dream, cherished inwardly, he\\r\\nnever confided to a soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nNature loves and favours such people. Ptitsin will certainly have his\\r\\nreward, not three houses, but four, precisely because from childhood up\\r\\nhe had realized that he would never be a Rothschild. That will be the\\r\\nlimit of Ptitsinâ\\x80\\x99s fortune, and, come what may, he will never have more\\r\\nthan four houses.\\r\\n\\r\\nVarvara Ardalionovna was not like her brother. She too, had passionate\\r\\ndesires, but they were persistent rather than impetuous. Her plans were\\r\\nas wise as her methods of carrying them out. No doubt she also belonged\\r\\nto the category of ordinary people who dream of being original, but she\\r\\nsoon discovered that she had not a grain of true originality, and she\\r\\ndid not let it trouble her too much. Perhaps a certain kind of pride\\r\\ncame to her help. She made her first concession to the demands of\\r\\npractical life with great resolution when she consented to marry\\r\\nPtitsin. However, when she married she did not say to herself, â\\x80\\x9cNever\\r\\nmind a mean action if it leads to the end in view,â\\x80\\x9d as her brother\\r\\nwould certainly have said in such a case; it is quite probable that he\\r\\nmay have said it when he expressed his elder-brotherly satisfaction at\\r\\nher decision. Far from this; Varvara Ardalionovna did not marry until\\r\\nshe felt convinced that her future husband was unassuming, agreeable,\\r\\nalmost cultured, and that nothing on earth would tempt him to a really\\r\\ndishonourable deed. As to small meannesses, such trifles did not\\r\\ntrouble her. Indeed, who is free from them? It is absurd to expect the\\r\\nideal! Besides, she knew that her marriage would provide a refuge for\\r\\nall her family. Seeing Gania unhappy, she was anxious to help him, in\\r\\nspite of their former disputes and misunderstandings. Ptitsin, in a\\r\\nfriendly way, would press his brother-in-law to enter the army. â\\x80\\x9cYou\\r\\nknow,â\\x80\\x9d he said sometimes, jokingly, â\\x80\\x9cyou despise generals and\\r\\ngeneraldom, but you will see that â\\x80\\x98theyâ\\x80\\x99 will all end by being generals\\r\\nin their turn. You will see it if you live long enough!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut why should they suppose that I despise generals?â\\x80\\x9d Gania thought\\r\\nsarcastically to himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo serve her brotherâ\\x80\\x99s interests, Varvara Ardalionovna was constantly\\r\\nat the Epanchinsâ\\x80\\x99 house, helped by the fact that in childhood she and\\r\\nGania had played with General Ivan Fedorovitchâ\\x80\\x99s daughters. It would\\r\\nhave been inconsistent with her character if in these visits she had\\r\\nbeen pursuing a chimera; her project was not chimerical at all; she was\\r\\nbuilding on a firm basisâ\\x80\\x94on her knowledge of the character of the\\r\\nEpanchin family, especially Aglaya, whom she studied closely. All\\r\\nVarvaraâ\\x80\\x99s efforts were directed towards bringing Aglaya and Gania\\r\\ntogether. Perhaps she achieved some result; perhaps, also, she made the\\r\\nmistake of depending too much upon her brother, and expecting more from\\r\\nhim than he would ever be capable of giving. However this may be, her\\r\\nmanoeuvres were skilful enough. For weeks at a time she would never\\r\\nmention Gania. Her attitude was modest but dignified, and she was\\r\\nalways extremely truthful and sincere. Examining the depths of her\\r\\nconscience, she found nothing to reproach herself with, and this still\\r\\nfurther strengthened her in her designs. But Varvara Ardalionovna\\r\\nsometimes remarked that she felt spiteful; that there was a good deal\\r\\nof vanity in her, perhaps even of wounded vanity. She noticed this at\\r\\ncertain times more than at others, and especially after her visits to\\r\\nthe Epanchins.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, as I have said, she returned from their house with a heavy\\r\\nfeeling of dejection. There was a sensation of bitterness, a sort of\\r\\nmocking contempt, mingled with it.\\r\\n\\r\\nArrived at her own house, Varia heard a considerable commotion going on\\r\\nin the upper storey, and distinguished the voices of her father and\\r\\nbrother. On entering the salon she found Gania pacing up and down at\\r\\nfrantic speed, pale with rage and almost tearing his hair. She frowned,\\r\\nand subsided on to the sofa with a tired air, and without taking the\\r\\ntrouble to remove her hat. She very well knew that if she kept quiet\\r\\nand asked her brother nothing about his reason for tearing up and down\\r\\nthe room, his wrath would fall upon her head. So she hastened to put\\r\\nthe question:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe old story, eh?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOld story? No! Heaven knows whatâ\\x80\\x99s up nowâ\\x80\\x94I donâ\\x80\\x99t! Father has simply\\r\\ngone mad; motherâ\\x80\\x99s in floods of tears. Upon my word, Varia, I must kick\\r\\nhim out of the house; or else go myself,â\\x80\\x9d he added, probably\\r\\nremembering that he could not well turn people out of a house which was\\r\\nnot his own.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou must make allowances,â\\x80\\x9d murmured Varia.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMake allowances? For whom? Himâ\\x80\\x94the old blackguard? No, no, Variaâ\\x80\\x94that\\r\\nwonâ\\x80\\x99t do! It wonâ\\x80\\x99t do, I tell you! And look at the swagger of the man!\\r\\nHeâ\\x80\\x99s all to blame himself, and yet he puts on so much â\\x80\\x98sideâ\\x80\\x99 that youâ\\x80\\x99d\\r\\nthinkâ\\x80\\x94my word!â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98Itâ\\x80\\x99s too much trouble to go through the gate, you must\\r\\nbreak the fence for me!â\\x80\\x99 Thatâ\\x80\\x99s the sort of air he puts on; but whatâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nthe matter with you, Varia? What a curious expression you have!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m all right,â\\x80\\x9d said Varia, in a tone that sounded as though she were\\r\\nall wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nGania looked more intently at her.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ve been _there?_â\\x80\\x9d he asked, suddenly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDid you find out anything?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNothing unexpected. I discovered that itâ\\x80\\x99s all true. My husband was\\r\\nwiser than either of us. Just as he suspected from the beginning, so it\\r\\nhas fallen out. Where is he?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOut. Wellâ\\x80\\x94what has happened?â\\x80\\x94go on.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe prince is formally engaged to herâ\\x80\\x94thatâ\\x80\\x99s settled. The elder\\r\\nsisters told me about it. Aglaya has agreed. They donâ\\x80\\x99t attempt to\\r\\nconceal it any longer; you know how mysterious and secret they have all\\r\\nbeen up to now. Adelaidaâ\\x80\\x99s wedding is put off again, so that both can\\r\\nbe married on one day. Isnâ\\x80\\x99t that delightfully romantic? Somebody ought\\r\\nto write a poem on it. Sit down and write an ode instead of tearing up\\r\\nand down like that. This evening Princess Bielokonski is to arrive; she\\r\\ncomes just in timeâ\\x80\\x94they have a party tonight. He is to be presented to\\r\\nold Bielokonski, though I believe he knows her already; probably the\\r\\nengagement will be openly announced. They are only afraid that he may\\r\\nknock something down, or trip over something when he comes into the\\r\\nroom. It would be just like him.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nGania listened attentively, but to his sisterâ\\x80\\x99s astonishment he was by\\r\\nno means so impressed by this news (which should, she thought, have\\r\\nbeen so important to him) as she had expected.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, it was clear enough all along,â\\x80\\x9d he said, after a momentâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nreflection. â\\x80\\x9cSo thatâ\\x80\\x99s the end,â\\x80\\x9d he added, with a disagreeable smile,\\r\\ncontinuing to walk up and down the room, but much slower than before,\\r\\nand glancing slyly into his sisterâ\\x80\\x99s face.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a good thing that you take it philosophically, at all events,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nsaid Varia. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m really very glad of it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, itâ\\x80\\x99s off our handsâ\\x80\\x94off _yours_, I should say.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think I have served you faithfully. I never even asked you what\\r\\nhappiness you expected to find with Aglaya.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDid I ever expect to find happiness with Aglaya?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome, come, donâ\\x80\\x99t overdo your philosophy. Of course you did. Now itâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nall over, and a good thing, too; pair of fools that we have been! I\\r\\nconfess I have never been able to look at it seriously. I busied myself\\r\\nin it for your sake, thinking that there was no knowing what might\\r\\nhappen with a funny girl like that to deal with. There were ninety to\\r\\none chances against it. To this moment I canâ\\x80\\x99t make out why you wished\\r\\nfor it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHâ\\x80\\x99m! now, I suppose, you and your husband will never weary of egging\\r\\nme on to work again. Youâ\\x80\\x99ll begin your lectures about perseverance and\\r\\nstrength of will, and all that. I know it all by heart,â\\x80\\x9d said Gania,\\r\\nlaughing.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s got some new idea in his head,â\\x80\\x9d thought Varia. â\\x80\\x9cAre they pleased\\r\\nover thereâ\\x80\\x94the parents?â\\x80\\x9d asked Gania, suddenly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cN-no, I donâ\\x80\\x99t think they are. You can judge for yourself. I think the\\r\\ngeneral is pleased enough; her mother is a little uneasy. She always\\r\\nloathed the idea of the prince as a _husband_; everybody knows that.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course, naturally. The bridegroom is an impossible and ridiculous\\r\\none. I mean, has _she_ given her formal consent?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe has not said â\\x80\\x98no,â\\x80\\x99 up to now, and thatâ\\x80\\x99s all. It was sure to be so\\r\\nwith her. You know what she is like. You know how absurdly shy she is.\\r\\nYou remember how she used to hide in a cupboard as a child, so as to\\r\\navoid seeing visitors, for hours at a time. She is just the same now;\\r\\nbut, do you know, I think there is something serious in the matter,\\r\\neven from her side; I feel it, somehow. She laughs at the prince, they\\r\\nsay, from morn to night in order to hide her real feelings; but you may\\r\\nbe sure she finds occasion to say something or other to him on the sly,\\r\\nfor he himself is in a state of radiant happiness. He walks in the\\r\\nclouds; they say he is extremely funny just now; I heard it from\\r\\nthemselves. They seemed to be laughing at me in their sleevesâ\\x80\\x94those\\r\\nelder girlsâ\\x80\\x94I donâ\\x80\\x99t know why.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nGania had begun to frown, and probably Varia added this last sentence\\r\\nin order to probe his thought. However, at this moment, the noise began\\r\\nagain upstairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll turn him out!â\\x80\\x9d shouted Gania, glad of the opportunity of venting\\r\\nhis vexation. â\\x80\\x9cI shall just turn him outâ\\x80\\x94we canâ\\x80\\x99t have this.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, and then heâ\\x80\\x99ll go about the place and disgrace us as he did\\r\\nyesterday.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow â\\x80\\x98as he did yesterdayâ\\x80\\x99? What do you mean? What did he do\\r\\nyesterday?â\\x80\\x9d asked Gania, in alarm.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, goodness me, donâ\\x80\\x99t you know?â\\x80\\x9d Varia stopped short.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat? You donâ\\x80\\x99t mean to say that he went there yesterday!â\\x80\\x9d cried\\r\\nGania, flushing red with shame and anger. â\\x80\\x9cGood heavens, Varia! Speak!\\r\\nYou have just been there. _Was_ he there or not, _quick?_â\\x80\\x9d And Gania\\r\\nrushed for the door. Varia followed and caught him by both hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat are you doing? Where are you going to? You canâ\\x80\\x99t let him go now;\\r\\nif you do heâ\\x80\\x99ll go and do something worse.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat did he do there? What did he say?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey couldnâ\\x80\\x99t tell me themselves; they couldnâ\\x80\\x99t make head or tail of\\r\\nit; but he frightened them all. He came to see the general, who was not\\r\\nat home; so he asked for Lizabetha Prokofievna. First of all, he begged\\r\\nher for some place, or situation, for work of some kind, and then he\\r\\nbegan to complain about _us_, about me and my husband, and you,\\r\\nespecially _you_; he said a lot of things.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh! couldnâ\\x80\\x99t you find out?â\\x80\\x9d muttered Gania, trembling hysterically.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNoâ\\x80\\x94nothing more than that. Why, they couldnâ\\x80\\x99t understand him\\r\\nthemselves; and very likely didnâ\\x80\\x99t tell me all.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nGania seized his head with both hands and tottered to the window; Varia\\r\\nsat down at the other window.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFunny girl, Aglaya,â\\x80\\x9d she observed, after a pause. â\\x80\\x9cWhen she left me\\r\\nshe said, â\\x80\\x98Give my special and personal respects to your parents; I\\r\\nshall certainly find an opportunity to see your father one day,â\\x80\\x99 and so\\r\\nserious over it. Sheâ\\x80\\x99s a strange creature.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWasnâ\\x80\\x99t she joking? She was speaking sarcastically!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot a bit of it; thatâ\\x80\\x99s just the strange part of it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDoes she know about father, do you thinkâ\\x80\\x94or not?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat they do _not_ know about it in the house is quite certain, the\\r\\nrest of them, I mean; but you have given me an idea. Aglaya perhaps\\r\\nknows. She alone, though, if anyone; for the sisters were as astonished\\r\\nas I was to hear her speak so seriously. If she knows, the prince must\\r\\nhave told her.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh! itâ\\x80\\x99s not a great matter to guess who told her. A thief! A thief in\\r\\nour family, and the head of the family, too!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh! nonsense!â\\x80\\x9d cried Varia, angrily. â\\x80\\x9cThat was nothing but a\\r\\ndrunkardâ\\x80\\x99s tale. Nonsense! Why, who invented the whole thingâ\\x80\\x94Lebedeff\\r\\nand the princeâ\\x80\\x94a pretty pair! Both were probably drunk.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFather is a drunkard and a thief; I am a beggar, and the husband of my\\r\\nsister is a usurer,â\\x80\\x9d continued Gania, bitterly. â\\x80\\x9cThere was a pretty\\r\\nlist of advantages with which to enchant the heart of Aglaya.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat same husband of your sister, the usurerâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFeeds me? Go on. Donâ\\x80\\x99t stand on ceremony, pray.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t lose your temper. You are just like a schoolboy. You think that\\r\\nall this sort of thing would harm you in Aglayaâ\\x80\\x99s eyes, do you? You\\r\\nlittle know her character. She is capable of refusing the most\\r\\nbrilliant party, and running away and starving in a garret with some\\r\\nwretched student; thatâ\\x80\\x99s the sort of girl she is. You never could or\\r\\ndid understand how interesting you would have seen in her eyes if you\\r\\nhad come firmly and proudly through our misfortunes. The prince has\\r\\nsimply caught her with hook and line; firstly, because he never thought\\r\\nof fishing for her, and secondly, because he is an idiot in the eyes of\\r\\nmost people. Itâ\\x80\\x99s quite enough for her that by accepting him she puts\\r\\nher family out and annoys them all roundâ\\x80\\x94thatâ\\x80\\x99s what she likes. You\\r\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t understand these things.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe shall see whether I understand or no!â\\x80\\x9d said Gania, enigmatically.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut I shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t like her to know all about father, all the same. I\\r\\nthought the prince would manage to hold his tongue about this, at\\r\\nleast. He prevented Lebedeff spreading the newsâ\\x80\\x94he wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t even tell\\r\\nme all when I asked himâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen you must see that he is not responsible. What does it matter to\\r\\nyou now, in any case? What are you hoping for still? If you _have_ a\\r\\nhope left, it is that your suffering air may soften her heart towards\\r\\nyou.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, she would funk a scandal like anyone else. You are all tarred with\\r\\none brush!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat! _Aglaya_ would have funked? You are a chicken-hearted fellow,\\r\\nGania!â\\x80\\x9d said Varia, looking at her brother with contempt. â\\x80\\x9cNot one of\\r\\nus is worth much. Aglaya may be a wild sort of a girl, but she is far\\r\\nnobler than any of us, a thousand times nobler!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWellâ\\x80\\x94come! thereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing to get cross about,â\\x80\\x9d said Gania.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAll Iâ\\x80\\x99m afraid of isâ\\x80\\x94mother. Iâ\\x80\\x99m afraid this scandal about father may\\r\\ncome to her ears; perhaps it has already. I am dreadfully afraid.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt undoubtedly has already!â\\x80\\x9d observed Gania.\\r\\n\\r\\nVaria had risen from her place and had started to go upstairs to her\\r\\nmother; but at this observation of Ganiaâ\\x80\\x99s she turned and gazed at him\\r\\nattentively.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWho could have told her?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHippolyte, probably. He would think it the most delightful amusement\\r\\nin the world to tell her of it the instant he moved over here; I\\r\\nhavenâ\\x80\\x99t a doubt of it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut how could he know anything of it? Tell me that. Lebedeff and the\\r\\nprince determined to tell no oneâ\\x80\\x94even Colia knows nothing.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat, Hippolyte? He found it out himself, of course. Why, you have no\\r\\nidea what a cunning little animal he is; dirty little gossip! He has\\r\\nthe most extraordinary nose for smelling out other peopleâ\\x80\\x99s secrets, or\\r\\nanything approaching to scandal. Believe it or not, but Iâ\\x80\\x99m pretty sure\\r\\nhe has got round Aglaya. If he hasnâ\\x80\\x99t, he soon will. Rogojin is\\r\\nintimate with him, too. How the prince doesnâ\\x80\\x99t notice it, I canâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nunderstand. The little wretch considers me his enemy now and does his\\r\\nbest to catch me tripping. What on earth does it matter to him, when\\r\\nheâ\\x80\\x99s dying? However, youâ\\x80\\x99ll see; I shall catch _him_ tripping yet, and\\r\\nnot he me.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy did you get him over here, if you hate him so? And is it really\\r\\nworth your while to try to score off him?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, it was yourself who advised me to bring him over!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI thought he might be useful. You know he is in love with Aglaya\\r\\nhimself, now, and has written to her; he has even written to Lizabetha\\r\\nProkofievna!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh! heâ\\x80\\x99s not dangerous there!â\\x80\\x9d cried Gania, laughing angrily.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHowever, I believe there is something of that sort in the air; he is\\r\\nvery likely to be in love, for he is a mere boy. But he wonâ\\x80\\x99t write\\r\\nanonymous letters to the old lady; that would be too audacious a thing\\r\\nfor him to attempt; but I dare swear the very first thing he did was to\\r\\nshow me up to Aglaya as a base deceiver and intriguer. I confess I was\\r\\nfool enough to attempt something through him at first. I thought he\\r\\nwould throw himself into my service out of revengeful feelings towards\\r\\nthe prince, the sly little beast! But I know him better now. As for the\\r\\ntheft, he may have heard of it from the widow in Petersburg, for if the\\r\\nold man committed himself to such an act, he can have done it for no\\r\\nother object but to give the money to her. Hippolyte said to me,\\r\\nwithout any prelude, that the general had promised the widow four\\r\\nhundred roubles. Of course I understood, and the little wretch looked\\r\\nat me with a nasty sort of satisfaction. I know him; you may depend\\r\\nupon it he went and told mother too, for the pleasure of wounding her.\\r\\nAnd why doesnâ\\x80\\x99t he die, I should like to know? He undertook to die\\r\\nwithin three weeks, and here he is getting fatter. His cough is better,\\r\\ntoo. It was only yesterday that he said that was the second day he\\r\\nhadnâ\\x80\\x99t coughed blood.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, turn him out!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t _hate_, I despise him,â\\x80\\x9d said Gania, grandly. â\\x80\\x9cWell, I do hate\\r\\nhim, if you like!â\\x80\\x9d he added, with a sudden access of rage, â\\x80\\x9cand Iâ\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\ntell him so to his face, even when heâ\\x80\\x99s dying! If you had but read his\\r\\nconfessionâ\\x80\\x94good Lord! what refinement of impudence! Oh, but Iâ\\x80\\x99d have\\r\\nliked to whip him then and there, like a schoolboy, just to see how\\r\\nsurprised he would have been! Now he hates everybody because heâ\\x80\\x94Oh, I\\r\\nsay, what on earth are they doing there! Listen to that noise! I really\\r\\ncanâ\\x80\\x99t stand this any longer. Ptitsin!â\\x80\\x9d he cried, as the latter entered\\r\\nthe room, â\\x80\\x9cwhat in the name of goodness are we coming to? Listen to\\r\\nthatâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the noise came rapidly nearer, the door burst open, and old General\\r\\nIvolgin, raging, furious, purple-faced, and trembling with anger,\\r\\nrushed in. He was followed by Nina Alexandrovna, Colia, and behind the\\r\\nrest, Hippolyte.\\r\\n\\r\\nII.\\r\\n\\r\\nHippolyte had now been five days at the Ptitsinsâ\\x80\\x99. His flitting from\\r\\nthe princeâ\\x80\\x99s to these new quarters had been brought about quite\\r\\nnaturally and without many words. He did not quarrel with the princeâ\\x80\\x94in\\r\\nfact, they seemed to part as friends. Gania, who had been hostile\\r\\nenough on that eventful evening, had himself come to see him a couple\\r\\nof days later, probably in obedience to some sudden impulse. For some\\r\\nreason or other, Rogojin too had begun to visit the sick boy. The\\r\\nprince thought it might be better for him to move away from his (the\\r\\nprinceâ\\x80\\x99s) house. Hippolyte informed him, as he took his leave, that\\r\\nPtitsin â\\x80\\x9chad been kind enough to offer him a corner,â\\x80\\x9d and did not say a\\r\\nword about Gania, though Gania had procured his invitation, and himself\\r\\ncame to fetch him away. Gania noticed this at the time, and put it to\\r\\nHippolyteâ\\x80\\x99s debit on account.\\r\\n\\r\\nGania was right when he told his sister that Hippolyte was getting\\r\\nbetter; that he was better was clear at the first glance. He entered\\r\\nthe room now last of all, deliberately, and with a disagreeable smile\\r\\non his lips.\\r\\n\\r\\nNina Alexandrovna came in, looking frightened. She had changed much\\r\\nsince we last saw her, half a year ago, and had grown thin and pale.\\r\\nColia looked worried and perplexed. He could not understand the\\r\\nvagaries of the general, and knew nothing of the last achievement of\\r\\nthat worthy, which had caused so much commotion in the house. But he\\r\\ncould see that his father had of late changed very much, and that he\\r\\nhad begun to behave in so extraordinary a fashion both at home and\\r\\nabroad that he was not like the same man. What perplexed and disturbed\\r\\nhim as much as anything was that his father had entirely given up\\r\\ndrinking during the last few days. Colia knew that he had quarrelled\\r\\nwith both Lebedeff and the prince, and had just bought a small bottle\\r\\nof vodka and brought it home for his father.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cReally, mother,â\\x80\\x9d he had assured Nina Alexandrovna upstairs, â\\x80\\x9creally\\r\\nyou had better let him drink. He has not had a drop for three days; he\\r\\nmust be suffering agoniesâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d The general now entered the room, threw the\\r\\ndoor wide open, and stood on the threshold trembling with indignation.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLook here, my dear sir,â\\x80\\x9d he began, addressing Ptitsin in a very loud\\r\\ntone of voice; â\\x80\\x9cif you have really made up your mind to sacrifice an\\r\\nold manâ\\x80\\x94your father too or at all events father of your wifeâ\\x80\\x94an old man\\r\\nwho has served his emperorâ\\x80\\x94to a wretched little atheist like this, all\\r\\nI can say is, sir, my foot shall cease to tread your floors. Make your\\r\\nchoice, sir; make your choice quickly, if you please! Me or thisâ\\x80\\x94screw!\\r\\nYes, screw, sir; I said it accidentally, but let the word standâ\\x80\\x94this\\r\\nscrew, for he screws and drills himself into my soulâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHadnâ\\x80\\x99t you better say corkscrew?â\\x80\\x9d said Hippolyte.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, sir, _not_ corkscrew. I am a general, not a bottle, sir. Make your\\r\\nchoice, sirâ\\x80\\x94me or him.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Colia handed him a chair, and he subsided into it, breathless with\\r\\nrage.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHadnâ\\x80\\x99t you betterâ\\x80\\x94betterâ\\x80\\x94take a nap?â\\x80\\x9d murmured the stupefied Ptitsin.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA nap?â\\x80\\x9d shrieked the general. â\\x80\\x9cI am not drunk, sir; you insult me! I\\r\\nsee,â\\x80\\x9d he continued, rising, â\\x80\\x9cI see that all are against me here.\\r\\nEnoughâ\\x80\\x94I go; but know, sirsâ\\x80\\x94know thatâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was not allowed to finish his sentence. Somebody pushed him back\\r\\ninto his chair, and begged him to be calm. Nina Alexandrovna trembled,\\r\\nand cried quietly. Gania retired to the window in disgust.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut what have I done? What is his grievance?â\\x80\\x9d asked Hippolyte,\\r\\ngrinning.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat have you done, indeed?â\\x80\\x9d put in Nina Alexandrovna. â\\x80\\x9cYou ought to\\r\\nbe ashamed of yourself, teasing an old man like thatâ\\x80\\x94and in your\\r\\nposition, too.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd pray what _is_ my position, madame? I have the greatest respect\\r\\nfor you, personally; butâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s a little screw,â\\x80\\x9d cried the general; â\\x80\\x9che drills holes in my heart\\r\\nand soul. He wishes me to be a pervert to atheism. Know, you young\\r\\ngreenhorn, that I was covered with honours before ever you were born;\\r\\nand you are nothing better than a wretched little worm, torn in two\\r\\nwith coughing, and dying slowly of your own malice and unbelief. What\\r\\ndid Gavrila bring you over here for? Theyâ\\x80\\x99re all against me, even to my\\r\\nown sonâ\\x80\\x94all against me.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, comeâ\\x80\\x94nonsense!â\\x80\\x9d cried Gania; â\\x80\\x9cif you did not go shaming us all\\r\\nover the town, things might be better for all parties.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x94shame you? I?â\\x80\\x94what do you mean, you young calf? I shame you? I\\r\\ncan only do you honour, sir; I cannot shame you.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe jumped up from his chair in a fit of uncontrollable rage. Gania was\\r\\nvery angry too.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHonour, indeed!â\\x80\\x9d said the latter, with contempt.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat do you say, sir?â\\x80\\x9d growled the general, taking a step towards him.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI say that I have but to open my mouth, and youâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nGania began, but did not finish. The twoâ\\x80\\x94father and sonâ\\x80\\x94stood before\\r\\none another, both unspeakably agitated, especially Gania.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGania, Gania, reflect!â\\x80\\x9d cried his mother, hurriedly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s all nonsense on both sides,â\\x80\\x9d snapped out Varia. â\\x80\\x9cLet them alone,\\r\\nmother.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s only for motherâ\\x80\\x99s sake that I spare him,â\\x80\\x9d said Gania, tragically.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSpeak!â\\x80\\x9d said the general, beside himself with rage and excitement;\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cspeakâ\\x80\\x94under the penalty of a fatherâ\\x80\\x99s curse!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, fatherâ\\x80\\x99s curse be hangedâ\\x80\\x94you donâ\\x80\\x99t frighten me that way!â\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nGania. â\\x80\\x9cWhose fault is it that you have been as mad as a March hare all\\r\\nthis week? It is just a weekâ\\x80\\x94you see, I count the days. Take care now;\\r\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t provoke me too much, or Iâ\\x80\\x99ll tell all. Why did you go to the\\r\\nEpanchinsâ\\x80\\x99 yesterdayâ\\x80\\x94tell me that? And you call yourself an old man,\\r\\ntoo, with grey hair, and father of a family! Hâ\\x80\\x99mâ\\x80\\x94nice sort of a\\r\\nfather.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBe quiet, Gania,â\\x80\\x9d cried Colia. â\\x80\\x9cShut up, you fool!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, but how have I offended him?â\\x80\\x9d repeated Hippolyte, still in the\\r\\nsame jeering voice. â\\x80\\x9cWhy does he call me a screw? You all heard it. He\\r\\ncame to me himself and began telling me about some Captain Eropegoff. I\\r\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t wish for your company, general. I always avoided youâ\\x80\\x94you know\\r\\nthat. What have I to do with Captain Eropegoff? All I did was to\\r\\nexpress my opinion that probably Captain Eropegoff never existed at\\r\\nall!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course he never existed!â\\x80\\x9d Gania interrupted.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the general only stood stupefied and gazed around in a dazed way.\\r\\nGaniaâ\\x80\\x99s speech had impressed him, with its terrible candour. For the\\r\\nfirst moment or two he could find no words to answer him, and it was\\r\\nonly when Hippolyte burst out laughing, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere, you see! Even your own son supports my statement that there\\r\\nnever was such a person as Captain Eropegoff!â\\x80\\x9d that the old fellow\\r\\nmuttered confusedly:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cKapiton Eropegoffâ\\x80\\x94not Captain Eropegoff!â\\x80\\x94Kapitonâ\\x80\\x94major\\r\\nretiredâ\\x80\\x94Eropegoffâ\\x80\\x94Kapiton.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cKapiton didnâ\\x80\\x99t exist either!â\\x80\\x9d persisted Gania, maliciously.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat? Didnâ\\x80\\x99t exist?â\\x80\\x9d cried the poor general, and a deep blush suffused\\r\\nhis face.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99ll do, Gania!â\\x80\\x9d cried Varia and Ptitsin.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShut up, Gania!â\\x80\\x9d said Colia.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this intercession seemed to rekindle the general.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat did you mean, sir, that he didnâ\\x80\\x99t exist? Explain yourself,â\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nrepeated, angrily.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBecause he _didnâ\\x80\\x99t_ existâ\\x80\\x94never could and never didâ\\x80\\x94there! Youâ\\x80\\x99d\\r\\nbetter drop the subject, I warn you!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd this is my sonâ\\x80\\x94my own sonâ\\x80\\x94whom Iâ\\x80\\x94oh, gracious Heaven!\\r\\nEropegoffâ\\x80\\x94Eroshka Eropegoff didnâ\\x80\\x99t exist!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHa, ha! itâ\\x80\\x99s Eroshka now,â\\x80\\x9d laughed Hippolyte.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, sir, Kapitoshkaâ\\x80\\x94not Eroshka. I mean, Kapiton Alexeyevitchâ\\x80\\x94retired\\r\\nmajorâ\\x80\\x94married Maria Petrovna Luâ\\x80\\x94Luâ\\x80\\x94he was my friend and\\r\\ncompanionâ\\x80\\x94Lutugoffâ\\x80\\x94from our earliest beginnings. I closed his eyes for\\r\\nhimâ\\x80\\x94he was killed. Kapiton Eropegoff never existed! tfu!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general shouted in his fury; but it was to be concluded that his\\r\\nwrath was not kindled by the expressed doubt as to Kapitonâ\\x80\\x99s existence.\\r\\nThis was his scapegoat; but his excitement was caused by something\\r\\nquite different. As a rule he would have merely shouted down the doubt\\r\\nas to Kapiton, told a long yarn about his friend, and eventually\\r\\nretired upstairs to his room. But today, in the strange uncertainty of\\r\\nhuman nature, it seemed to require but so small an offence as this to\\r\\nmake his cup to overflow. The old man grew purple in the face, he\\r\\nraised his hands. â\\x80\\x9cEnough of this!â\\x80\\x9d he yelled. â\\x80\\x9cMy curseâ\\x80\\x94away, out of\\r\\nthe house I go! Colia, bring my bag away!â\\x80\\x9d He left the room hastily and\\r\\nin a paroxysm of rage.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis wife, Colia, and Ptitsin ran out after him.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat have you done now?â\\x80\\x9d said Varia to Gania. â\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99ll probably be\\r\\nmaking off _there_ again! What a disgrace it all is!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, he shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t steal,â\\x80\\x9d cried Gania, panting with fury. And just at\\r\\nthis moment his eye met Hippolyteâ\\x80\\x99s.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAs for you, sir,â\\x80\\x9d he cried, â\\x80\\x9cyou should at least remember that you are\\r\\nin a strange house andâ\\x80\\x94receiving hospitality; you should not take the\\r\\nopportunity of tormenting an old man, sir, who is too evidently out of\\r\\nhis mind.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHippolyte looked furious, but he restrained himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t quite agree with you that your father is out of his mind,â\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nobserved, quietly. â\\x80\\x9cOn the contrary, I cannot help thinking he has been\\r\\nless demented of late. Donâ\\x80\\x99t you think so? He has grown so cunning and\\r\\ncareful, and weighs his words so deliberately; he spoke to me about\\r\\nthat Kapiton fellow with an object, you know! Just fancyâ\\x80\\x94he wanted me\\r\\ntoâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, devil take what he wanted you to do! Donâ\\x80\\x99t try to be too cunning\\r\\nwith me, young man!â\\x80\\x9d shouted Gania. â\\x80\\x9cIf you are aware of the real\\r\\nreason for my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s present condition (and you have kept such an\\r\\nexcellent spying watch during these last few days that you are sure to\\r\\nbe aware of it)â\\x80\\x94you had no right whatever to torment theâ\\x80\\x94unfortunate\\r\\nman, and to worry my mother by your exaggerations of the affair;\\r\\nbecause the whole business is nonsenseâ\\x80\\x94simply a drunken freak, and\\r\\nnothing more, quite unproved by any evidence, and I donâ\\x80\\x99t believe that\\r\\nmuch of it!â\\x80\\x9d (he snapped his fingers). â\\x80\\x9cBut you must needs spy and\\r\\nwatch over us all, because you are aâ\\x80\\x94aâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cScrew!â\\x80\\x9d laughed Hippolyte.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBecause you are a humbug, sir; and thought fit to worry people for\\r\\nhalf an hour, and tried to frighten them into believing that you would\\r\\nshoot yourself with your little empty pistol, pirouetting about and\\r\\nplaying at suicide! I gave you hospitality, you have fattened on it,\\r\\nyour cough has left you, and you repay all thisâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExcuse meâ\\x80\\x94two words! I am Varvara Ardalionovnaâ\\x80\\x99s guest, not yours;\\r\\n_you_ have extended no hospitality to me. On the contrary, if I am not\\r\\nmistaken, I believe you are yourself indebted to Mr. Ptitsinâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nhospitality. Four days ago I begged my mother to come down here and\\r\\nfind lodgings, because I certainly do feel better here, though I am not\\r\\nfat, nor have I ceased to cough. I am today informed that my room is\\r\\nready for me; therefore, having thanked your sister and mother for\\r\\ntheir kindness to me, I intend to leave the house this evening. I beg\\r\\nyour pardonâ\\x80\\x94I interrupted youâ\\x80\\x94I think you were about to add something?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOhâ\\x80\\x94if that is the state of affairsâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d began Gania.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExcuse meâ\\x80\\x94I will take a seat,â\\x80\\x9d interrupted Hippolyte once more,\\r\\nsitting down deliberately; â\\x80\\x9cfor I am not strong yet. Now then, I am\\r\\nready to hear you. Especially as this is the last chance we shall have\\r\\nof a talk, and very likely the last meeting we shall ever have at all.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nGania felt a little guilty.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI assure you I did not mean to reckon up debits and credits,â\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nbegan, â\\x80\\x9cand if youâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t understand your condescension,â\\x80\\x9d said Hippolyte. â\\x80\\x9cAs for me, I\\r\\npromised myself, on the first day of my arrival in this house, that I\\r\\nwould have the satisfaction of settling accounts with you in a very\\r\\nthorough manner before I said good-bye to you. I intend to perform this\\r\\noperation now, if you like; after you, though, of course.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMay I ask you to be so good as to leave this room?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99d better speak out. Youâ\\x80\\x99ll be sorry afterwards if you donâ\\x80\\x99t.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHippolyte, stop, please! Itâ\\x80\\x99s so dreadfully undignified,â\\x80\\x9d said Varia.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, only for the sake of a lady,â\\x80\\x9d said Hippolyte, laughing. â\\x80\\x9cI am\\r\\nready to put off the reckoning, but only put it off, Varvara\\r\\nArdalionovna, because an explanation between your brother and myself\\r\\nhas become an absolute necessity, and I could not think of leaving the\\r\\nhouse without clearing up all misunderstandings first.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn a word, you are a wretched little scandal-monger,â\\x80\\x9d cried Gania,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand you cannot go away without a scandal!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou see,â\\x80\\x9d said Hippolyte, coolly, â\\x80\\x9cyou canâ\\x80\\x99t restrain yourself. Youâ\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\nbe dreadfully sorry afterwards if you donâ\\x80\\x99t speak out now. Come, you\\r\\nshall have the first say. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll wait.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nGania was silent and merely looked contemptuously at him.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou wonâ\\x80\\x99t? Very well. I shall be as short as possible, for my part.\\r\\nTwo or three times to-day I have had the word â\\x80\\x98hospitalityâ\\x80\\x99 pushed down\\r\\nmy throat; this is not fair. In inviting me here you yourself entrapped\\r\\nme for your own use; you thought I wished to revenge myself upon the\\r\\nprince. You heard that Aglaya Ivanovna had been kind to me and read my\\r\\nconfession. Making sure that I should give myself up to your interests,\\r\\nyou hoped that you might get some assistance out of me. I will not go\\r\\ninto details. I donâ\\x80\\x99t ask either admission or confirmation of this from\\r\\nyourself; I am quite content to leave you to your conscience, and to\\r\\nfeel that we understand one another capitally.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat a history you are weaving out of the most ordinary\\r\\ncircumstances!â\\x80\\x9d cried Varia.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI told you the fellow was nothing but a scandal-monger,â\\x80\\x9d said Gania.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExcuse me, Varia Ardalionovna, I will proceed. I can, of course,\\r\\nneither love nor respect the prince, though he is a good-hearted\\r\\nfellow, if a little queer. But there is no need whatever for me to hate\\r\\nhim. I quite understood your brother when he first offered me aid\\r\\nagainst the prince, though I did not show it; I knew well that your\\r\\nbrother was making a ridiculous mistake in me. I am ready to spare him,\\r\\nhowever, even now; but solely out of respect for yourself, Varvara\\r\\nArdalionovna.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHaving now shown you that I am not quite such a fool as I look, and\\r\\nthat I have to be fished for with a rod and line for a good long while\\r\\nbefore I am caught, I will proceed to explain why I specially wished to\\r\\nmake your brother look a fool. That my motive power is hate, I do not\\r\\nattempt to conceal. I have felt that before dying (and I am dying,\\r\\nhowever much fatter I may appear to you), I must absolutely make a fool\\r\\nof, at least, one of that class of men which has dogged me all my life,\\r\\nwhich I hate so cordially, and which is so prominently represented by\\r\\nyour much esteemed brother. I should not enjoy paradise nearly so much\\r\\nwithout having done this first. I hate you, Gavrila Ardalionovitch,\\r\\nsolely (this may seem curious to you, but I repeat)â\\x80\\x94solely because you\\r\\nare the type, and incarnation, and head, and crown of the most\\r\\nimpudent, the most self-satisfied, the most vulgar and detestable form\\r\\nof commonplaceness. You are ordinary of the ordinary; you have no\\r\\nchance of ever fathering the pettiest idea of your own. And yet you are\\r\\nas jealous and conceited as you can possibly be; you consider yourself\\r\\na great genius; of this you are persuaded, although there are dark\\r\\nmoments of doubt and rage, when even this fact seems uncertain. There\\r\\nare spots of darkness on your horizon, though they will disappear when\\r\\nyou become completely stupid. But a long and chequered path lies before\\r\\nyou, and of this I am glad. In the first place you will never gain a\\r\\ncertain person.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome, come! This is intolerable! You had better stop, you little\\r\\nmischief-making wretch!â\\x80\\x9d cried Varia. Gania had grown very pale; he\\r\\ntrembled, but said nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nHippolyte paused, and looked at him intently and with great\\r\\ngratification. He then turned his gaze upon Varia, bowed, and went out,\\r\\nwithout adding another word.\\r\\n\\r\\nGania might justly complain of the hardness with which fate treated\\r\\nhim. Varia dared not speak to him for a long while, as he strode past\\r\\nher, backwards and forwards. At last he went and stood at the window,\\r\\nlooking out, with his back turned towards her. There was a fearful row\\r\\ngoing on upstairs again.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAre you off?â\\x80\\x9d said Gania, suddenly, remarking that she had risen and\\r\\nwas about to leave the room. â\\x80\\x9cWait a momentâ\\x80\\x94look at this.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe approached the table and laid a small sheet of paper before her. It\\r\\nlooked like a little note.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood heavens!â\\x80\\x9d cried Varia, raising her hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was the note:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGAVRILA ARDOLIONOVITCH,â\\x80\\x94persuaded of your kindness of heart, I have\\r\\ndetermined to ask your advice on a matter of great importance to\\r\\nmyself. I should like to meet you tomorrow morning at seven oâ\\x80\\x99clock by\\r\\nthe green bench in the park. It is not far from our house. Varvara\\r\\nArdalionovna, who must accompany you, knows the place well.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA. E.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat on earth is one to make of a girl like that?â\\x80\\x9d said Varia.\\r\\n\\r\\nGania, little as he felt inclined for swagger at this moment, could not\\r\\navoid showing his triumph, especially just after such humiliating\\r\\nremarks as those of Hippolyte. A smile of self-satisfaction beamed on\\r\\nhis face, and Varia too was brimming over with delight.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd this is the very day that they were to announce the engagement!\\r\\nWhat will she do next?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat do you suppose she wants to talk about tomorrow?â\\x80\\x9d asked Gania.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, _thatâ\\x80\\x99s_ all the same! The chief thing is that she wants to see\\r\\nyou after six monthsâ\\x80\\x99 absence. Look here, Gania, this is a _serious_\\r\\nbusiness. Donâ\\x80\\x99t swagger again and lose the gameâ\\x80\\x94play carefully, but\\r\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t funk, do you understand? As if she could possibly avoid seeing\\r\\nwhat I have been working for all this last six months! And just\\r\\nimagine, I was there this morning and not a word of this! I was there,\\r\\nyou know, on the sly. The old lady did not know, or she would have\\r\\nkicked me out. I ran some risk for you, you see. I did so want to find\\r\\nout, at all hazards.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHere there was a frantic noise upstairs once more; several people\\r\\nseemed to be rushing downstairs at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow, Gania,â\\x80\\x9d cried Varia, frightened, â\\x80\\x9cwe canâ\\x80\\x99t let him go out! We\\r\\ncanâ\\x80\\x99t afford to have a breath of scandal about the town at this moment.\\r\\nRun after him and beg his pardonâ\\x80\\x94quick.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the father of the family was out in the road already. Colia was\\r\\ncarrying his bag for him; Nina Alexandrovna stood and cried on the\\r\\ndoorstep; she wanted to run after the general, but Ptitsin kept her\\r\\nback.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou will only excite him more,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cHe has nowhere else to go\\r\\ntoâ\\x80\\x94heâ\\x80\\x99ll be back here in half an hour. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve talked it all over with\\r\\nColia; let him play the fool a bit, it will do him good.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat are you up to? Where are you off to? Youâ\\x80\\x99ve nowhere to go to, you\\r\\nknow,â\\x80\\x9d cried Gania, out of the window.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome back, father; the neighbours will hear!â\\x80\\x9d cried Varia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general stopped, turned round, raised his hands and remarked: â\\x80\\x9cMy\\r\\ncurse be upon this house!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhich observation should always be made in as theatrical a tone as\\r\\npossible,â\\x80\\x9d muttered Gania, shutting the window with a bang.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighbours undoubtedly did hear. Varia rushed out of the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo sooner had his sister left him alone, than Gania took the note out\\r\\nof his pocket, kissed it, and pirouetted around.\\r\\n\\r\\nIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a general rule, old General Ivolginâ\\x80\\x99s paroxysms ended in smoke. He\\r\\nhad before this experienced fits of sudden fury, but not very often,\\r\\nbecause he was really a man of peaceful and kindly disposition. He had\\r\\ntried hundreds of times to overcome the dissolute habits which he had\\r\\ncontracted of late years. He would suddenly remember that he was â\\x80\\x9ca\\r\\nfather,â\\x80\\x9d would be reconciled with his wife, and shed genuine tears. His\\r\\nfeeling for Nina Alexandrovna amounted almost to adoration; she had\\r\\npardoned so much in silence, and loved him still in spite of the state\\r\\nof degradation into which he had fallen. But the generalâ\\x80\\x99s struggles\\r\\nwith his own weakness never lasted very long. He was, in his way, an\\r\\nimpetuous man, and a quiet life of repentance in the bosom of his\\r\\nfamily soon became insupportable to him. In the end he rebelled, and\\r\\nflew into rages which he regretted, perhaps, even as he gave way to\\r\\nthem, but which were beyond his control. He picked quarrels with\\r\\neveryone, began to hold forth eloquently, exacted unlimited respect,\\r\\nand at last disappeared from the house, and sometimes did not return\\r\\nfor a long time. He had given up interfering in the affairs of his\\r\\nfamily for two years now, and knew nothing about them but what he\\r\\ngathered from hearsay.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut on this occasion there was something more serious than usual.\\r\\nEveryone seemed to know something, but to be afraid to talk about it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general had turned up in the bosom of his family two or three days\\r\\nbefore, but not, as usual, with the olive branch of peace in his hand,\\r\\nnot in the garb of penitenceâ\\x80\\x94in which he was usually clad on such\\r\\noccasionsâ\\x80\\x94but, on the contrary, in an uncommonly bad temper. He had\\r\\narrived in a quarrelsome mood, pitching into everyone he came across,\\r\\nand talking about all sorts and kinds of subjects in the most\\r\\nunexpected manner, so that it was impossible to discover what it was\\r\\nthat was really putting him out. At moments he would be apparently\\r\\nquite bright and happy; but as a rule he would sit moody and\\r\\nthoughtful. He would abruptly commence to hold forth about the\\r\\nEpanchins, about Lebedeff, or the prince, and equally abruptly would\\r\\nstop short and refuse to speak another word, answering all further\\r\\nquestions with a stupid smile, unconscious that he was smiling, or that\\r\\nhe had been asked a question. The whole of the previous night he had\\r\\nspent tossing about and groaning, and poor Nina Alexandrovna had been\\r\\nbusy making cold compresses and warm fomentations and so on, without\\r\\nbeing very clear how to apply them. He had fallen asleep after a while,\\r\\nbut not for long, and had awaked in a state of violent hypochondria\\r\\nwhich had ended in his quarrel with Hippolyte, and the solemn cursing\\r\\nof Ptitsinâ\\x80\\x99s establishment generally. It was also observed during those\\r\\ntwo or three days that he was in a state of morbid self-esteem, and was\\r\\nspecially touchy on all points of honour. Colia insisted, in discussing\\r\\nthe matter with his mother, that all this was but the outcome of\\r\\nabstinence from drink, or perhaps of pining after Lebedeff, with whom\\r\\nup to this time the general had been upon terms of the greatest\\r\\nfriendship; but with whom, for some reason or other, he had quarrelled\\r\\na few days since, parting from him in great wrath. There had also been\\r\\na scene with the prince. Colia had asked an explanation of the latter,\\r\\nbut had been forced to conclude that he was not told the whole truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Hippolyte and Nina Alexandrovna had, as Gania suspected, had some\\r\\nspecial conversation about the generalâ\\x80\\x99s actions, it was strange that\\r\\nthe malicious youth, whom Gania had called a scandal-monger to his\\r\\nface, had not allowed himself a similar satisfaction with Colia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fact is that probably Hippolyte was not quite so black as Gania\\r\\npainted him; and it was hardly likely that he had informed Nina\\r\\nAlexandrovna of certain events, of which we know, for the mere pleasure\\r\\nof giving her pain. We must never forget that human motives are\\r\\ngenerally far more complicated than we are apt to suppose, and that we\\r\\ncan very rarely accurately describe the motives of another. It is much\\r\\nbetter for the writer, as a rule, to content himself with the bare\\r\\nstatement of events; and we shall take this line with regard to the\\r\\ncatastrophe recorded above, and shall state the remaining events\\r\\nconnected with the generalâ\\x80\\x99s trouble shortly, because we feel that we\\r\\nhave already given to this secondary character in our story more\\r\\nattention than we originally intended.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe course of events had marched in the following order. When Lebedeff\\r\\nreturned, in company with the general, after their expedition to town a\\r\\nfew days since, for the purpose of investigation, he brought the prince\\r\\nno information whatever. If the latter had not himself been occupied\\r\\nwith other thoughts and impressions at the time, he must have observed\\r\\nthat Lebedeff not only was very uncommunicative, but even appeared\\r\\nanxious to avoid him.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the prince did give the matter a little attention, he recalled the\\r\\nfact that during these days he had always found Lebedeff to be in\\r\\nradiantly good spirits, when they happened to meet; and further, that\\r\\nthe general and Lebedeff were always together. The two friends did not\\r\\nseem ever to be parted for a moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nOccasionally the prince heard loud talking and laughing upstairs, and\\r\\nonce he detected the sound of a jolly soldierâ\\x80\\x99s song going on above,\\r\\nand recognized the unmistakable bass of the generalâ\\x80\\x99s voice. But the\\r\\nsudden outbreak of song did not last; and for an hour afterwards the\\r\\nanimated sound of apparently drunken conversation continued to be heard\\r\\nfrom above. At length there was the clearest evidence of a grand mutual\\r\\nembracing, and someone burst into tears. Shortly after this, however,\\r\\nthere was a violent but short-lived quarrel, with loud talking on both\\r\\nsides.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll these days Colia had been in a state of great mental preoccupation.\\r\\nMuishkin was usually out all day, and only came home late at night. On\\r\\nhis return he was invariably informed that Colia had been looking for\\r\\nhim. However, when they did meet, Colia never had anything particular\\r\\nto tell him, excepting that he was highly dissatisfied with the general\\r\\nand his present condition of mind and behaviour.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey drag each other about the place,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cand get drunk\\r\\ntogether at the pub close by here, and quarrel in the street on the way\\r\\nhome, and embrace one another after it, and donâ\\x80\\x99t seem to part for a\\r\\nmoment.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the prince pointed out that there was nothing new about that, for\\r\\nthat they had always behaved in this manner together, Colia did not\\r\\nknow what to say; in fact he could not explain what it was that\\r\\nspecially worried him, just now, about his father.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the morning following the bacchanalian songs and quarrels recorded\\r\\nabove, as the prince stepped out of the house at about eleven oâ\\x80\\x99clock,\\r\\nthe general suddenly appeared before him, much agitated.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have long sought the honour and opportunity of meeting\\r\\nyouâ\\x80\\x94much-esteemed Lef Nicolaievitch,â\\x80\\x9d he murmured, pressing the\\r\\nprinceâ\\x80\\x99s hand very hard, almost painfully so; â\\x80\\x9clongâ\\x80\\x94very long.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince begged him to step in and sit down.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNoâ\\x80\\x94I will not sit down,â\\x80\\x94I am keeping you, I see,â\\x80\\x94another time!â\\x80\\x94I think\\r\\nI may be permitted to congratulate you upon the realization of your\\r\\nheartâ\\x80\\x99s best wishes, is it not so?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat best wishes?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince blushed. He thought, as so many in his position do, that\\r\\nnobody had seen, heard, noticed, or understood anything.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOhâ\\x80\\x94be easy, sir, be easy! I shall not wound your tenderest feelings.\\r\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ve been through it all myself, and I know well how unpleasant it is\\r\\nwhen an outsider sticks his nose in where he is not wanted. I\\r\\nexperience this every morning. I came to speak to you about another\\r\\nmatter, though, an important matter. A very important matter, prince.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe latter requested him to take a seat once more, and sat down\\r\\nhimself.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWellâ\\x80\\x94just for one second, then. The fact is, I came for advice. Of\\r\\ncourse I live now without any very practical objects in life; but,\\r\\nbeing full of self-respect, in which quality the ordinary Russian is so\\r\\ndeficient as a rule, and of activity, I am desirous, in a word, prince,\\r\\nof placing myself and my wife and children in a position ofâ\\x80\\x94in fact, I\\r\\nwant advice.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince commended his aspirations with warmth.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuite soâ\\x80\\x94quite so! But this is all mere nonsense. I came here to speak\\r\\nof something quite different, something very important, prince. And I\\r\\nhave determined to come to you as to a man in whose sincerity and\\r\\nnobility of feeling I can trust likeâ\\x80\\x94likeâ\\x80\\x94are you surprised at my\\r\\nwords, prince?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince was watching his guest, if not with much surprise, at all\\r\\nevents with great attention and curiosity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old man was very pale; every now and then his lips trembled, and\\r\\nhis hands seemed unable to rest quietly, but continually moved from\\r\\nplace to place. He had twice already jumped up from his chair and sat\\r\\ndown again without being in the least aware of it. He would take up a\\r\\nbook from the table and open itâ\\x80\\x94talking all the while,â\\x80\\x94look at the\\r\\nheading of a chapter, shut it and put it back again, seizing another\\r\\nimmediately, but holding it unopened in his hand, and waving it in the\\r\\nair as he spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut enough!â\\x80\\x9d he cried, suddenly. â\\x80\\x9cI see I have been boring you with\\r\\nmyâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot in the leastâ\\x80\\x94not in the least, I assure you. On the contrary, I am\\r\\nlistening most attentively, and am anxious to guessâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPrince, I wish to place myself in a respectable positionâ\\x80\\x94I wish to\\r\\nesteem myselfâ\\x80\\x94and toâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear sir, a man of such noble aspirations is worthy of all esteem\\r\\nby virtue of those aspirations alone.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince brought out his â\\x80\\x9ccopy-book sentenceâ\\x80\\x9d in the firm belief that\\r\\nit would produce a good effect. He felt instinctively that some such\\r\\nwell-sounding humbug, brought out at the proper moment, would soothe\\r\\nthe old manâ\\x80\\x99s feelings, and would be specially acceptable to such a man\\r\\nin such a position. At all hazards, his guest must be despatched with\\r\\nheart relieved and spirit comforted; that was the problem before the\\r\\nprince at this moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe phrase flattered the general, touched him, and pleased him\\r\\nmightily. He immediately changed his tone, and started off on a long\\r\\nand solemn explanation. But listen as he would, the prince could make\\r\\nneither head nor tail of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general spoke hotly and quickly for ten minutes; he spoke as though\\r\\nhis words could not keep pace with his crowding thoughts. Tears stood\\r\\nin his eyes, and yet his speech was nothing but a collection of\\r\\ndisconnected sentences, without beginning and without endâ\\x80\\x94a string of\\r\\nunexpected words and unexpected sentimentsâ\\x80\\x94colliding with one another,\\r\\nand jumping over one another, as they burst from his lips.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEnough!â\\x80\\x9d he concluded at last, â\\x80\\x9cyou understand me, and that is the\\r\\ngreat thing. A heart like yours cannot help understanding the\\r\\nsufferings of another. Prince, you are the ideal of generosity; what\\r\\nare other men beside yourself? But you are youngâ\\x80\\x94accept my blessing! My\\r\\nprincipal object is to beg you to fix an hour for a most important\\r\\nconversationâ\\x80\\x94that is my great hope, prince. My heart needs but a little\\r\\nfriendship and sympathy, and yet I cannot always find means to satisfy\\r\\nit.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut why not now? I am ready to listen, andâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, noâ\\x80\\x94prince, not now! Now is a dream! And it is too, too important!\\r\\nIt is to be the hour of Fate to meâ\\x80\\x94_my own_ hour. Our interview is not\\r\\nto be broken in upon by every chance comer, every impertinent guestâ\\x80\\x94and\\r\\nthere are plenty of such stupid, impertinent fellowsâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94(he bent over and\\r\\nwhispered mysteriously, with a funny, frightened look on his face)â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cwho\\r\\nare unworthy to tie your shoe, prince. I donâ\\x80\\x99t say _mine_, mindâ\\x80\\x94you\\r\\nwill understand me, prince. Only _you_ understand me, princeâ\\x80\\x94no one\\r\\nelse. _He_ doesnâ\\x80\\x99t understand me, he is absolutelyâ\\x80\\x94_absolutely_ unable\\r\\nto sympathize. The first qualification for understanding another is\\r\\nHeart.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince was rather alarmed at all this, and was obliged to end by\\r\\nappointing the same hour of the following day for the interview\\r\\ndesired. The general left him much comforted and far less agitated than\\r\\nwhen he had arrived.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt seven in the evening, the prince sent to request Lebedeff to pay him\\r\\na visit. Lebedeff came at once, and â\\x80\\x9cesteemed it an honour,â\\x80\\x9d as he\\r\\nobserved, the instant he entered the room. He acted as though there had\\r\\nnever been the slightest suspicion of the fact that he had\\r\\nsystematically avoided the prince for the last three days.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe sat down on the edge of his chair, smiling and making faces, and\\r\\nrubbing his hands, and looking as though he were in delighted\\r\\nexpectation of hearing some important communication, which had been\\r\\nlong guessed by all.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince was instantly covered with confusion; for it appeared to be\\r\\nplain that everyone expected something of himâ\\x80\\x94that everyone looked at\\r\\nhim as though anxious to congratulate him, and greeted him with hints,\\r\\nand smiles, and knowing looks.\\r\\n\\r\\nKeller, for instance, had run into the house three times of late, â\\x80\\x9cjust\\r\\nfor a moment,â\\x80\\x9d and each time with the air of desiring to offer his\\r\\ncongratulations. Colia, too, in spite of his melancholy, had once or\\r\\ntwice begun sentences in much the same strain of suggestion or\\r\\ninsinuation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince, however, immediately began, with some show of annoyance, to\\r\\nquestion Lebedeff categorically, as to the generalâ\\x80\\x99s present condition,\\r\\nand his opinion thereon. He described the morningâ\\x80\\x99s interview in a few\\r\\nwords.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEveryone has his worries, prince, especially in these strange and\\r\\ntroublous times of ours,â\\x80\\x9d Lebedeff replied, drily, and with the air of\\r\\na man disappointed of his reasonable expectations.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDear me, what a philosopher you are!â\\x80\\x9d laughed the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPhilosophy is necessary, sirâ\\x80\\x94very necessaryâ\\x80\\x94in our day. It is too much\\r\\nneglected. As for me, much esteemed prince, I am sensible of having\\r\\nexperienced the honour of your confidence in a certain matter up to a\\r\\ncertain point, but never beyond that point. I do not for a moment\\r\\ncomplainâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLebedeff, you seem to be angry for some reason!â\\x80\\x9d said the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot the least bit in the world, esteemed and revered prince! Not the\\r\\nleast bit in the world!â\\x80\\x9d cried Lebedeff, solemnly, with his hand upon\\r\\nhis heart. â\\x80\\x9cOn the contrary, I am too painfully aware that neither by\\r\\nmy position in the world, nor by my gifts of intellect and heart, nor\\r\\nby my riches, nor by any former conduct of mine, have I in any way\\r\\ndeserved your confidence, which is far above my highest aspirations and\\r\\nhopes. Oh no, prince; I may serve you, but only as your humble slave! I\\r\\nam not angry, oh no! Not angry; pained perhaps, but nothing more.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear Lebedeff, Iâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, nothing more, nothing more! I was saying to myself but now... â\\x80\\x98I\\r\\nam quite unworthy of friendly relations with him,â\\x80\\x99 say I; â\\x80\\x98but perhaps\\r\\nas landlord of this house I may, at some future date, in his good time,\\r\\nreceive information as to certain imminent and much to be desired\\r\\nchangesâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo saying Lebedeff fixed the prince with his sharp little eyes, still\\r\\nin hope that he would get his curiosity satisfied.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince looked back at him in amazement.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t understand what you are driving at!â\\x80\\x9d he cried, almost angrily,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand, andâ\\x80\\x94what an intriguer you are, Lebedeff!â\\x80\\x9d he added, bursting into\\r\\na fit of genuine laughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nLebedeff followed suit at once, and it was clear from his radiant face\\r\\nthat he considered his prospects of satisfaction immensely improved.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd do you know,â\\x80\\x9d the prince continued, â\\x80\\x9cI am amazed at your naive\\r\\nways, Lebedeff! Donâ\\x80\\x99t be angry with meâ\\x80\\x94not only yours, everybody elseâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nalso! You are waiting to hear something from me at this very moment\\r\\nwith such simplicity that I declare I feel quite ashamed of myself for\\r\\nhaving nothing whatever to tell you. I swear to you solemnly, that\\r\\nthere is nothing to tell. There! Can you take that in?â\\x80\\x9d The prince\\r\\nlaughed again.\\r\\n\\r\\nLebedeff assumed an air of dignity. It was true enough that he was\\r\\nsometimes naive to a degree in his curiosity; but he was also an\\r\\nexcessively cunning gentleman, and the prince was almost converting him\\r\\ninto an enemy by his repeated rebuffs. The prince did not snub\\r\\nLebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s curiosity, however, because he felt any contempt for him;\\r\\nbut simply because the subject was too delicate to talk about. Only a\\r\\nfew days before he had looked upon his own dreams almost as crimes. But\\r\\nLebedeff considered the refusal as caused by personal dislike to\\r\\nhimself, and was hurt accordingly. Indeed, there was at this moment a\\r\\npiece of news, most interesting to the prince, which Lebedeff knew and\\r\\neven had wished to tell him, but which he now kept obstinately to\\r\\nhimself.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd what can I do for you, esteemed prince? Since I am told you sent\\r\\nfor me just now,â\\x80\\x9d he said, after a few momentsâ\\x80\\x99 silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, it was about the general,â\\x80\\x9d began the prince, waking abruptly from\\r\\nthe fit of musing which he too had indulged in â\\x80\\x9candâ\\x80\\x94and about the theft\\r\\nyou told me of.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat isâ\\x80\\x94erâ\\x80\\x94aboutâ\\x80\\x94what theft?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh come! just as if you didnâ\\x80\\x99t understand, Lukian Timofeyovitch! What\\r\\nare you up to? I canâ\\x80\\x99t make you out! The money, the money, sir! The\\r\\nfour hundred roubles that you lost that day. You came and told me about\\r\\nit one morning, and then went off to Petersburg. There, _now_ do you\\r\\nunderstand?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOhâ\\x80\\x94hâ\\x80\\x94h! You mean the four hundred roubles!â\\x80\\x9d said Lebedeff, dragging\\r\\nthe words out, just as though it had only just dawned upon him what the\\r\\nprince was talking about. â\\x80\\x9cThanks very much, prince, for your kind\\r\\ninterestâ\\x80\\x94you do me too much honour. I found the money, long ago!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou found it? Thank God for that!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYour exclamation proves the generous sympathy of your nature, prince;\\r\\nfor four hundred roublesâ\\x80\\x94to a struggling family man like myselfâ\\x80\\x94is no\\r\\nsmall matter!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI didnâ\\x80\\x99t mean that; at least, of course, Iâ\\x80\\x99m glad for your sake, too,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nadded the prince, correcting himself, â\\x80\\x9cbutâ\\x80\\x94how did you find it?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery simply indeed! I found it under the chair upon which my coat had\\r\\nhung; so that it is clear the purse simply fell out of the pocket and\\r\\non to the floor!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cUnder the chair? Impossible! Why, you told me yourself that you had\\r\\nsearched every corner of the room? How could you not have looked in the\\r\\nmost likely place of all?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course I looked there,â\\x80\\x94of course I did! Very much so! I looked and\\r\\nscrambled about, and felt for it, and wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t believe it was not\\r\\nthere, and looked again and again. It is always so in such cases. One\\r\\nlongs and expects to find a lost article; one sees it is not there, and\\r\\nthe place is as bare as oneâ\\x80\\x99s palm; and yet one returns and looks again\\r\\nand again, fifteen or twenty times, likely enough!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, quite so, of course. But how was it in your case?â\\x80\\x94I donâ\\x80\\x99t quite\\r\\nunderstand,â\\x80\\x9d said the bewildered prince. â\\x80\\x9cYou say it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t there at\\r\\nfirst, and that you searched the place thoroughly, and yet it turned up\\r\\non that very spot!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sirâ\\x80\\x94on that very spot.â\\x80\\x9d The prince gazed strangely at Lebedeff.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd the general?â\\x80\\x9d he asked, abruptly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTheâ\\x80\\x94the general? How do you mean, the general?â\\x80\\x9d said Lebedeff,\\r\\ndubiously, as though he had not taken in the drift of the princeâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nremark.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, good heavens! I mean, what did the general say when the purse\\r\\nturned up under the chair? You and he had searched for it together\\r\\nthere, hadnâ\\x80\\x99t you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuite soâ\\x80\\x94together! But the second time I thought better to say nothing\\r\\nabout finding it. I found it alone.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cButâ\\x80\\x94why in the worldâ\\x80\\x94and the money? Was it all there?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI opened the purse and counted it myself; right to a single rouble.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think you might have come and told me,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince,\\r\\nthoughtfully.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOhâ\\x80\\x94I didnâ\\x80\\x99t like to disturb you, prince, in the midst of your private\\r\\nand doubtless most interesting personal reflections. Besides, I wanted\\r\\nto appear, myself, to have found nothing. I took the purse, and opened\\r\\nit, and counted the money, and shut it and put it down again under the\\r\\nchair.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat in the world for?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, just out of curiosity,â\\x80\\x9d said Lebedeff, rubbing his hands and\\r\\nsniggering.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat, itâ\\x80\\x99s still there then, is it? Ever since the day before\\r\\nyesterday?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh no! You see, I was half in hopes the general might find it. Because\\r\\nif I found it, why should not he too observe an object lying before his\\r\\nvery eyes? I moved the chair several times so as to expose the purse to\\r\\nview, but the general never saw it. He is very absent just now,\\r\\nevidently. He talks and laughs and tells stories, and suddenly flies\\r\\ninto a rage with me, goodness knows why.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, butâ\\x80\\x94have you taken the purse away now?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, it disappeared from under the chair in the night.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhere is it now, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHere,â\\x80\\x9d laughed Lebedeff, at last, rising to his full height and\\r\\nlooking pleasantly at the prince, â\\x80\\x9chere, in the lining of my coat.\\r\\nLook, you can feel it for yourself, if you like!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSure enough there was something sticking out of the front of the\\r\\ncoatâ\\x80\\x94something large. It certainly felt as though it might well be the\\r\\npurse fallen through a hole in the pocket into the lining.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI took it out and had a look at it; itâ\\x80\\x99s all right. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve let it slip\\r\\nback into the lining now, as you see, and so I have been walking about\\r\\never since yesterday morning; it knocks against my legs when I walk\\r\\nalong.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHâ\\x80\\x99m! and you take no notice of it?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuite so, I take no notice of it. Ha, ha! and think of this, prince,\\r\\nmy pockets are always strong and whole, and yet, here in one night, is\\r\\na huge hole. I know the phenomenon is unworthy of your notice; but such\\r\\nis the case. I examined the hole, and I declare it actually looks as\\r\\nthough it had been made with a pen-knife, a most improbable\\r\\ncontingency.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAndâ\\x80\\x94andâ\\x80\\x94the general?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, very angry all day, sir; all yesterday and all today. He shows\\r\\ndecided bacchanalian predilections at one time, and at another is\\r\\ntearful and sensitive, but at any moment he is liable to paroxysms of\\r\\nsuch rage that I assure you, prince, I am quite alarmed. I am not a\\r\\nmilitary man, you know. Yesterday we were sitting together in the\\r\\ntavern, and the lining of my coat wasâ\\x80\\x94quite accidentally, of\\r\\ncourseâ\\x80\\x94sticking out right in front. The general squinted at it, and\\r\\nflew into a rage. He never looks me quite in the face now, unless he is\\r\\nvery drunk or maudlin; but yesterday he looked at me in such a way that\\r\\na shiver went all down my back. I intend to find the purse tomorrow;\\r\\nbut till then I am going to have another night of it with him.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s the good of tormenting him like this?â\\x80\\x9d cried the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t torment him, prince, I donâ\\x80\\x99t indeed!â\\x80\\x9d cried Lebedeff, hotly.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI love him, my dear sir, I esteem him; and believe it or not, I love\\r\\nhim all the better for this business, yesâ\\x80\\x94and value him more.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLebedeff said this so seriously that the prince quite lost his temper\\r\\nwith him.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNonsense! love him and torment him so! Why, by the very fact that he\\r\\nput the purse prominently before you, first under the chair and then in\\r\\nyour lining, he shows that he does not wish to deceive you, but is\\r\\nanxious to beg your forgiveness in this artless way. Do you hear? He is\\r\\nasking your pardon. He confides in the delicacy of your feelings, and\\r\\nin your friendship for him. And you can allow yourself to humiliate so\\r\\nthoroughly honest a man!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThoroughly honest, quite so, prince, thoroughly honest!â\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nLebedeff, with flashing eyes. â\\x80\\x9cAnd only you, prince, could have found\\r\\nso very appropriate an expression. I honour you for it, prince. Very\\r\\nwell, thatâ\\x80\\x99s settled; I shall find the purse now and not tomorrow.\\r\\nHere, I find it and take it out before your eyes! And the money is all\\r\\nright. Take it, prince, and keep it till tomorrow, will you? Tomorrow\\r\\nor next day Iâ\\x80\\x99ll take it back again. I think, prince, that the night\\r\\nafter its disappearance it was buried under a bush in the garden. So I\\r\\nbelieveâ\\x80\\x94what do you think of that?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, take care you donâ\\x80\\x99t tell him to his face that you have found the\\r\\npurse. Simply let him see that it is no longer in the lining of your\\r\\ncoat, and form his own conclusions.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you think so? Had I not just better tell him I have found it, and\\r\\npretend I never guessed where it was?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I donâ\\x80\\x99t think so,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, thoughtfully; â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s too late\\r\\nfor thatâ\\x80\\x94that would be dangerous now. No, no! Better say nothing about\\r\\nit. Be nice with him, you know, but donâ\\x80\\x99t show himâ\\x80\\x94oh, _you_ know well\\r\\nenoughâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know, prince, of course I know, but Iâ\\x80\\x99m afraid I shall not carry it\\r\\nout; for to do so one needs a heart like your own. He is so very\\r\\nirritable just now, and so proud. At one moment he will embrace me, and\\r\\nthe next he flies out at me and sneers at me, and then I stick the\\r\\nlining forward on purpose. Well, _au revoir_, prince, I see I am\\r\\nkeeping you, and boring you, too, interfering with your most\\r\\ninteresting private reflections.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow, do be careful! Secrecy, as before!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, silence isnâ\\x80\\x99t the word! Softly, softly!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in spite of this conclusion to the episode, the prince remained as\\r\\npuzzled as ever, if not more so. He awaited next morningâ\\x80\\x99s interview\\r\\nwith the general most impatiently.\\r\\n\\r\\nIV.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe time appointed was twelve oâ\\x80\\x99clock, and the prince, returning home\\r\\nunexpectedly late, found the general waiting for him. At the first\\r\\nglance, he saw that the latter was displeased, perhaps because he had\\r\\nbeen kept waiting. The prince apologized, and quickly took a seat. He\\r\\nseemed strangely timid before the general this morning, for some\\r\\nreason, and felt as though his visitor were some piece of china which\\r\\nhe was afraid of breaking.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn scrutinizing him, the prince soon saw that the general was quite a\\r\\ndifferent man from what he had been the day before; he looked like one\\r\\nwho had come to some momentous resolve. His calmness, however, was more\\r\\napparent than real. He was courteous, but there was a suggestion of\\r\\ninjured innocence in his manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve brought your book back,â\\x80\\x9d he began, indicating a book lying on the\\r\\ntable. â\\x80\\x9cMuch obliged to you for lending it to me.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, yes. Well, did you read it, general? Itâ\\x80\\x99s curious, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it?â\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nthe prince, delighted to be able to open up conversation upon an\\r\\noutside subject.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCurious enough, yes, but crude, and of course dreadful nonsense;\\r\\nprobably the man lies in every other sentence.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general spoke with considerable confidence, and dragged his words\\r\\nout with a conceited drawl.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, but itâ\\x80\\x99s only the simple tale of an old soldier who saw the French\\r\\nenter Moscow. Some of his remarks were wonderfully interesting. Remarks\\r\\nof an eye-witness are always valuable, whoever he be, donâ\\x80\\x99t you think\\r\\nso?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHad I been the publisher I should not have printed it. As to the\\r\\nevidence of eye-witnesses, in these days people prefer impudent lies to\\r\\nthe stories of men of worth and long service. I know of some notes of\\r\\nthe year 1812, whichâ\\x80\\x94I have determined, prince, to leave this house,\\r\\nMr. Lebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s house.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general looked significantly at his host.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course you have your own lodging at Pavlofsk atâ\\x80\\x94at your daughterâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nhouse,â\\x80\\x9d began the prince, quite at a loss what to say. He suddenly\\r\\nrecollected that the general had come for advice on a most important\\r\\nmatter, affecting his destiny.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAt my wifeâ\\x80\\x99s; in other words, at my own place, my daughterâ\\x80\\x99s house.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI beg your pardon, Iâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI leave Lebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s house, my dear prince, because I have quarrelled\\r\\nwith this person. I broke with him last night, and am very sorry that I\\r\\ndid not do so before. I expect respect, prince, even from those to whom\\r\\nI give my heart, so to speak. Prince, I have often given away my heart,\\r\\nand am nearly always deceived. This person was quite unworthy of the\\r\\ngift.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere is much that might be improved in him,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince,\\r\\nmoderately, â\\x80\\x9cbut he has some qualities whichâ\\x80\\x94though amid them one\\r\\ncannot but discern a cunning natureâ\\x80\\x94reveal what is often a diverting\\r\\nintellect.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe princeâ\\x80\\x99s tone was so natural and respectful that the general could\\r\\nnot possibly suspect him of any insincerity.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, that he possesses good traits, I was the first to show, when I\\r\\nvery nearly made him a present of my friendship. I am not dependent\\r\\nupon his hospitality, and upon his house; I have my own family. I do\\r\\nnot attempt to justify my own weakness. I have drunk with this man, and\\r\\nperhaps I deplore the fact now, but I did not take him up for the sake\\r\\nof drink alone (excuse the crudeness of the expression, prince); I did\\r\\nnot make friends with him for that alone. I was attracted by his good\\r\\nqualities; but when the fellow declares that he was a child in 1812,\\r\\nand had his left leg cut off, and buried in the Vagarkoff cemetery, in\\r\\nMoscow, such a cock-and-bull story amounts to disrespect, my dear sir,\\r\\ntoâ\\x80\\x94to impudent exaggeration.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, he was very likely joking; he said it for fun.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI quite understand you. You mean that an innocent lie for the sake of\\r\\na good joke is harmless, and does not offend the human heart. Some\\r\\npeople lie, if you like to put it so, out of pure friendship, in order\\r\\nto amuse their fellows; but when a man makes use of extravagance in\\r\\norder to show his disrespect and to make clear how the intimacy bores\\r\\nhim, it is time for a man of honour to break off the said intimacy, and\\r\\nto teach the offender his place.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general flushed with indignation as he spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, but Lebedeff cannot have been in Moscow in 1812. He is much too\\r\\nyoung; it is all nonsense.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery well, but even if we admit that he _was_ alive in 1812, can one\\r\\nbelieve that a French chasseur pointed a cannon at him for a lark, and\\r\\nshot his left leg off? He says he picked his own leg up and took it\\r\\naway and buried it in the cemetery. He swore he had a stone put up over\\r\\nit with the inscription: â\\x80\\x98Here lies the leg of Collegiate Secretary\\r\\nLebedeff,â\\x80\\x99 and on the other side, â\\x80\\x98Rest, beloved ashes, till the morn\\r\\nof joy,â\\x80\\x99 and that he has a service read over it every year (which is\\r\\nsimply sacrilege), and goes to Moscow once a year on purpose. He\\r\\ninvites me to Moscow in order to prove his assertion, and show me his\\r\\nlegâ\\x80\\x99s tomb, and the very cannon that shot him; he says itâ\\x80\\x99s the\\r\\neleventh from the gate of the Kremlin, an old-fashioned falconet taken\\r\\nfrom the French afterwards.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd, meanwhile both his legs are still on his body,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince,\\r\\nlaughing. â\\x80\\x9cI assure you, it is only an innocent joke, and you need not\\r\\nbe angry about it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExcuse meâ\\x80\\x94wait a minuteâ\\x80\\x94he says that the leg we see is a wooden one,\\r\\nmade by Tchernosvitoff.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey do say one can dance with those!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuite so, quite so; and he swears that his wife never found out that\\r\\none of his legs was wooden all the while they were married. When I\\r\\nshowed him the ridiculousness of all this, he said, â\\x80\\x98Well, if you were\\r\\none of Napoleonâ\\x80\\x99s pages in 1812, you might let me bury my leg in the\\r\\nMoscow cemetery.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, did you sayâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d began the prince, and paused in confusion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general gazed at his host disdainfully.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, go on,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cfinish your sentence, by all means. Say how odd\\r\\nit appears to you that a man fallen to such a depth of humiliation as\\r\\nI, can ever have been the actual eye-witness of great events. Go on,\\r\\n_I_ donâ\\x80\\x99t mind! Has _he_ found time to tell you scandal about me?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve heard nothing of this from Lebedeff, if you mean Lebedeff.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHâ\\x80\\x99m; I thought differently. You see, we were talking over this period\\r\\nof history. I was criticizing a current report of something which then\\r\\nhappened, and having been myself an eye-witness of the occurrenceâ\\x80\\x94you\\r\\nare smiling, princeâ\\x80\\x94you are looking at my face as ifâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh no! not at allâ\\x80\\x94Iâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am rather young-looking, I know; but I am actually older than I\\r\\nappear to be. I was ten or eleven in the year 1812. I donâ\\x80\\x99t know my age\\r\\nexactly, but it has always been a weakness of mine to make it out less\\r\\nthan it really is.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI assure you, general, I do not in the least doubt your statement. One\\r\\nof our living autobiographers states that when he was a small baby in\\r\\nMoscow in 1812 the French soldiers fed him with bread.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, there you see!â\\x80\\x9d said the general, condescendingly. â\\x80\\x9cThere is\\r\\nnothing whatever unusual about my tale. Truth very often appears to be\\r\\nimpossible. I was a pageâ\\x80\\x94it sounds strange, I dare say. Had I been\\r\\nfifteen years old I should probably have been terribly frightened when\\r\\nthe French arrived, as my mother was (who had been too slow about\\r\\nclearing out of Moscow); but as I was only just ten I was not in the\\r\\nleast alarmed, and rushed through the crowd to the very door of the\\r\\npalace when Napoleon alighted from his horse.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cUndoubtedly, at ten years old you would not have felt the sense of\\r\\nfear, as you say,â\\x80\\x9d blurted out the prince, horribly uncomfortable in\\r\\nthe sensation that he was just about to blush.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course; and it all happened so easily and naturally. And yet, were\\r\\na novelist to describe the episode, he would put in all kinds of\\r\\nimpossible and incredible details.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh,â\\x80\\x9d cried the prince, â\\x80\\x9cI have often thought that! Why, I know of a\\r\\nmurder, for the sake of a watch. Itâ\\x80\\x99s in all the papers now. But if\\r\\nsome writer had invented it, all the critics would have jumped down his\\r\\nthroat and said the thing was too improbable for anything. And yet you\\r\\nread it in the paper, and you canâ\\x80\\x99t help thinking that out of these\\r\\nstrange disclosures is to be gained the full knowledge of Russian life\\r\\nand character. You said that well, general; it is so true,â\\x80\\x9d concluded\\r\\nthe prince, warmly, delighted to have found a refuge from the fiery\\r\\nblushes which had covered his face.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, itâ\\x80\\x99s quite true, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it?â\\x80\\x9d cried the general, his eyes sparkling\\r\\nwith gratification. â\\x80\\x9cA small boy, a child, would naturally realize no\\r\\ndanger; he would shove his way through the crowds to see the shine and\\r\\nglitter of the uniforms, and especially the great man of whom everyone\\r\\nwas speaking, for at that time all the world had been talking of no one\\r\\nbut this man for some years past. The world was full of his name; Iâ\\x80\\x94so\\r\\nto speakâ\\x80\\x94drew it in with my motherâ\\x80\\x99s milk. Napoleon, passing a couple\\r\\nof paces from me, caught sight of me accidentally. I was very well\\r\\ndressed, and being all alone, in that crowd, as you will easily\\r\\nimagine...â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, of course! Naturally the sight impressed him, and proved to him\\r\\nthat not _all_ the aristocracy had left Moscow; that at least some\\r\\nnobles and their children had remained behind.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cJust so! just so! He wanted to win over the aristocracy! When his\\r\\neagle eye fell on me, mine probably flashed back in response. â\\x80\\x98_VoilÃ\\xa0\\r\\nun garÃ§on bien Ã©veillÃ©! Qui est ton pÃ¨re?_â\\x80\\x99 I immediately replied,\\r\\nalmost panting with excitement, â\\x80\\x98A general, who died on the\\r\\nbattle-fields of his country!â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98_Le fils dâ\\x80\\x99un boyard et dâ\\x80\\x99un brave,\\r\\npardessus le marchÃ©. Jâ\\x80\\x99aime les boyards. Mâ\\x80\\x99aimes-tu, petit?_â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTo this keen question I replied as keenly, â\\x80\\x98The Russian heart can\\r\\nrecognize a great man even in the bitter enemy of his country.â\\x80\\x99 At\\r\\nleast, I donâ\\x80\\x99t remember the exact words, you know, but the idea was as\\r\\nI say. Napoleon was struck; he thought a minute and then said to his\\r\\nsuite: â\\x80\\x98I like that boyâ\\x80\\x99s pride; if all Russians think like this child,\\r\\nthenâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x99 he didnâ\\x80\\x99t finish, but went on and entered the palace. I\\r\\ninstantly mixed with his suite, and followed him. I was already in high\\r\\nfavour. I remember when he came into the first hall, the emperor\\r\\nstopped before a portrait of the Empress Katherine, and after a\\r\\nthoughtful glance remarked, â\\x80\\x98That was a great woman,â\\x80\\x99 and passed on.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, in a couple of days I was known all over the palace and the\\r\\nKremlin as â\\x80\\x98le petit boyard.â\\x80\\x99 I only went home to sleep. They were\\r\\nnearly out of their minds about me at home. A couple of days after\\r\\nthis, Napoleonâ\\x80\\x99s page, De Bazancour, died; he had not been able to\\r\\nstand the trials of the campaign. Napoleon remembered me; I was taken\\r\\naway without explanation; the dead pageâ\\x80\\x99s uniform was tried on me, and\\r\\nwhen I was taken before the emperor, dressed in it, he nodded his head\\r\\nto me, and I was told that I was appointed to the vacant post of page.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, I was glad enough, for I had long felt the greatest sympathy for\\r\\nthis man; and then the pretty uniform and all thatâ\\x80\\x94only a child, you\\r\\nknowâ\\x80\\x94and so on. It was a dark green dress coat with gold buttonsâ\\x80\\x94red\\r\\nfacings, white trousers, and a white silk waistcoatâ\\x80\\x94silk stockings,\\r\\nshoes with buckles, and top-boots if I were riding out with his majesty\\r\\nor with the suite.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThough the position of all of us at that time was not particularly\\r\\nbrilliant, and the poverty was dreadful all round, yet the etiquette at\\r\\ncourt was strictly preserved, and the more strictly in proportion to\\r\\nthe growth of the forebodings of disaster.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuite so, quite so, of course!â\\x80\\x9d murmured the poor prince, who didnâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nknow where to look. â\\x80\\x9cYour memoirs would be most interesting.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general was, of course, repeating what he had told Lebedeff the\\r\\nnight before, and thus brought it out glibly enough, but here he looked\\r\\nsuspiciously at the prince out of the corners of his eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy memoirs!â\\x80\\x9d he began, with redoubled pride and dignity. â\\x80\\x9cWrite my\\r\\nmemoirs? The idea has not tempted me. And yet, if you please, my\\r\\nmemoirs have long been written, but they shall not see the light until\\r\\ndust returns to dust. Then, I doubt not, they will be translated into\\r\\nall languages, not of course on account of their actual literary merit,\\r\\nbut because of the great events of which I was the actual witness,\\r\\nthough but a child at the time. As a child, I was able to penetrate\\r\\ninto the secrecy of the great manâ\\x80\\x99s private room. At nights I have\\r\\nheard the groans and wailings of this â\\x80\\x98giant in distress.â\\x80\\x99 He could\\r\\nfeel no shame in weeping before such a mere child as I was, though I\\r\\nunderstood even then that the reason for his suffering was the silence\\r\\nof the Emperor Alexander.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, of course; he had written letters to the latter with proposals of\\r\\npeace, had he not?â\\x80\\x9d put in the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe did not know the details of his proposals, but he wrote letter\\r\\nafter letter, all day and every day. He was dreadfully agitated.\\r\\nSometimes at night I would throw myself upon his breast with tears (Oh,\\r\\nhow I loved that man!). â\\x80\\x98Ask forgiveness, Oh, ask forgiveness of the\\r\\nEmperor Alexander!â\\x80\\x99 I would cry. I should have said, of course, â\\x80\\x98Make\\r\\npeace with Alexander,â\\x80\\x99 but as a child I expressed my idea in the naive\\r\\nway recorded. â\\x80\\x98Oh, my child,â\\x80\\x99 he would say (he loved to talk to me and\\r\\nseemed to forget my tender years), â\\x80\\x98Oh, my child, I am ready to kiss\\r\\nAlexanderâ\\x80\\x99s feet, but I hate and abominate the King of Prussia and the\\r\\nAustrian Emperor, andâ\\x80\\x94andâ\\x80\\x94but you know nothing of politics, my child.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nHe would pull up, remembering whom he was speaking to, but his eyes\\r\\nwould sparkle for a long while after this. Well now, if I were to\\r\\ndescribe all this, and I have seen greater events than these, all these\\r\\ncritical gentlemen of the press and political partiesâ\\x80\\x94Oh, no thanks!\\r\\nIâ\\x80\\x99m their very humble servant, but no thanks!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuite soâ\\x80\\x94partiesâ\\x80\\x94you are very right,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince. â\\x80\\x9cI was reading\\r\\na book about Napoleon and the Waterloo campaign only the other day, by\\r\\nCharasse, in which the author does not attempt to conceal his joy at\\r\\nNapoleonâ\\x80\\x99s discomfiture at every page. Well now, I donâ\\x80\\x99t like that; it\\r\\nsmells of â\\x80\\x98party,â\\x80\\x99 you know. You are quite right. And were you much\\r\\noccupied with your service under Napoleon?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general was in ecstasies, for the princeâ\\x80\\x99s remarks, made, as they\\r\\nevidently were, in all seriousness and simplicity, quite dissipated the\\r\\nlast relics of his suspicion.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know Charasseâ\\x80\\x99s book! Oh! I was so angry with his work! I wrote to\\r\\nhim and saidâ\\x80\\x94I forget what, at this moment. You ask whether I was very\\r\\nbusy under the Emperor? Oh no! I was called â\\x80\\x98page,â\\x80\\x99 but hardly took my\\r\\nduty seriously. Besides, Napoleon very soon lost hope of conciliating\\r\\nthe Russians, and he would have forgotten all about me had he not loved\\r\\nmeâ\\x80\\x94for personal reasonsâ\\x80\\x94I donâ\\x80\\x99t mind saying so now. My heart was\\r\\ngreatly drawn to him, too. My duties were light. I merely had to be at\\r\\nthe palace occasionally to escort the Emperor out riding, and that was\\r\\nabout all. I rode very fairly well. He used to have a ride before\\r\\ndinner, and his suite on those occasions were generally Davoust,\\r\\nmyself, and Roustan.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cConstant?â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, suddenly, and quite involuntarily.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo; Constant was away then, taking a letter to the Empress Josephine.\\r\\nInstead of him there were always a couple of orderliesâ\\x80\\x94and that was\\r\\nall, excepting, of course, the generals and marshals whom Napoleon\\r\\nalways took with him for the inspection of various localities, and for\\r\\nthe sake of consultation generally. I remember there was\\r\\noneâ\\x80\\x94Davoustâ\\x80\\x94nearly always with himâ\\x80\\x94a big man with spectacles. They used\\r\\nto argue and quarrel sometimes. Once they were in the Emperorâ\\x80\\x99s study\\r\\ntogetherâ\\x80\\x94just those two and myselfâ\\x80\\x94I was unobservedâ\\x80\\x94and they argued,\\r\\nand the Emperor seemed to be agreeing to something under protest.\\r\\nSuddenly his eye fell on me and an idea seemed to flash across him.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Child,â\\x80\\x99 he said, abruptly. â\\x80\\x98If I were to recognize the Russian\\r\\northodox religion and emancipate the serfs, do you think Russia would\\r\\ncome over to me?â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Never!â\\x80\\x99 I cried, indignantly.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Emperor was much struck.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98In the flashing eyes of this patriotic child I read and accept the\\r\\nfiat of the Russian people. Enough, Davoust, it is mere phantasy on our\\r\\npart. Come, letâ\\x80\\x99s hear your other project.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, but that was a great idea,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, clearly interested.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou ascribe it to Davoust, do you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, at all events, they were consulting together at the time. Of\\r\\ncourse it was the idea of an eagle, and must have originated with\\r\\nNapoleon; but the other project was good tooâ\\x80\\x94it was the â\\x80\\x98Conseil du\\r\\nlion!â\\x80\\x99 as Napoleon called it. This project consisted in a proposal to\\r\\noccupy the Kremlin with the whole army; to arm and fortify it\\r\\nscientifically, to kill as many horses as could be got, and salt their\\r\\nflesh, and spend the winter there; and in spring to fight their way\\r\\nout. Napoleon liked the ideaâ\\x80\\x94it attracted him. We rode round the\\r\\nKremlin walls every day, and Napoleon used to give orders where they\\r\\nwere to be patched, where built up, where pulled down and so on. All\\r\\nwas decided at last. They were alone togetherâ\\x80\\x94those two and myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNapoleon was walking up and down with folded arms. I could not take my\\r\\neyes off his faceâ\\x80\\x94my heart beat loudly and painfully.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99m off,â\\x80\\x99 said Davoust. â\\x80\\x98Where to?â\\x80\\x99 asked Napoleon.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98To salt horse-flesh,â\\x80\\x99 said Davoust. Napoleon shudderedâ\\x80\\x94his fate was\\r\\nbeing decided.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Child,â\\x80\\x99 he addressed me suddenly, â\\x80\\x98what do you think of our plan?â\\x80\\x99 Of\\r\\ncourse he only applied to me as a sort of toss-up, you know. I turned\\r\\nto Davoust and addressed my reply to him. I said, as though inspired:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Escape, general! Go home!â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe project was abandoned; Davoust shrugged his shoulders and went\\r\\nout, whispering to himselfâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98_Bah, il devient superstitieux!_â\\x80\\x99 Next\\r\\nmorning the order to retreat was given.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAll this is most interesting,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, very softly, â\\x80\\x9cif it\\r\\nreally was soâ\\x80\\x94that is, I meanâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d he hastened to correct himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, my dear prince,â\\x80\\x9d cried the general, who was now so intoxicated\\r\\nwith his own narrative that he probably could not have pulled up at the\\r\\nmost patent indiscretion. â\\x80\\x9cYou say, â\\x80\\x98if it really was so!â\\x80\\x99 There was\\r\\nmoreâ\\x80\\x94_much_ more, I assure you! These are merely a few little political\\r\\nacts. I tell you I was the eye-witness of the nightly sorrow and\\r\\ngroanings of the great man, and of _that_ no one can speak but myself.\\r\\nTowards the end he wept no more, though he continued to emit an\\r\\noccasional groan; but his face grew more overcast day by day, as though\\r\\nEternity were wrapping its gloomy mantle about him. Occasionally we\\r\\npassed whole hours of silence together at night, Roustan snoring in the\\r\\nnext roomâ\\x80\\x94that fellow slept like a pig. â\\x80\\x98But heâ\\x80\\x99s loyal to me and my\\r\\ndynasty,â\\x80\\x99 said Napoleon of him.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSometimes it was very painful to me, and once he caught me with tears\\r\\nin my eyes. He looked at me kindly. â\\x80\\x98You are sorry for me,â\\x80\\x99 he said,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98you, my child, and perhaps one other childâ\\x80\\x94my son, the King of\\r\\nRomeâ\\x80\\x94may grieve for me. All the rest hate me; and my brothers are the\\r\\nfirst to betray me in misfortune.â\\x80\\x99 I sobbed and threw myself into his\\r\\narms. He could not resist meâ\\x80\\x94he burst into tears, and our tears mingled\\r\\nas we folded each other in a close embrace.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Write, oh, write a letter to the Empress Josephine!â\\x80\\x99 I cried,\\r\\nsobbing. Napoleon started, reflected, and said, â\\x80\\x98You remind me of a\\r\\nthird heart which loves me. Thank you, my friend;â\\x80\\x99 and then and there\\r\\nhe sat down and wrote that letter to Josephine, with which Constant was\\r\\nsent off next day.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou did a good action,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, â\\x80\\x9cfor in the midst of his\\r\\nangry feelings you insinuated a kind thought into his heart.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cJust so, prince, just so. How well you bring out that fact! Because\\r\\nyour own heart is good!â\\x80\\x9d cried the ecstatic old gentleman, and,\\r\\nstrangely enough, real tears glistened in his eyes. â\\x80\\x9cYes, prince, it\\r\\nwas a wonderful spectacle. And, do you know, I all but went off to\\r\\nParis, and should assuredly have shared his solitary exile with him;\\r\\nbut, alas, our destinies were otherwise ordered! We parted, he to his\\r\\nisland, where I am sure he thought of the weeping child who had\\r\\nembraced him so affectionately at parting in Moscow; and I was sent off\\r\\nto the cadet corps, where I found nothing but roughness and harsh\\r\\ndiscipline. Alas, my happy days were done!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98I do not wish to deprive your mother of you, and, therefore, I will\\r\\nnot ask you to go with me,â\\x80\\x99 he said, the morning of his departure, â\\x80\\x98but\\r\\nI should like to do something for you.â\\x80\\x99 He was mounting his horse as he\\r\\nspoke. â\\x80\\x98Write something in my sisterâ\\x80\\x99s album for me,â\\x80\\x99 I said rather\\r\\ntimidly, for he was in a state of great dejection at the moment. He\\r\\nturned, called for a pen, took the album. â\\x80\\x98How old is your sister?â\\x80\\x99 he\\r\\nasked, holding the pen in his hand. â\\x80\\x98Three years old,â\\x80\\x99 I said. â\\x80\\x98Ah,\\r\\n_petite fille alors!_â\\x80\\x99 and he wrote in the album:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Ne mentez jamais! NAPOLÃ\\x89ON (votre ami sincÃ¨re).â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSuch advice, and at such a moment, you must allow, prince, wasâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, quite so; very remarkable.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis page of the album, framed in gold, hung on the wall of my\\r\\nsisterâ\\x80\\x99s drawing-room all her life, in the most conspicuous place, till\\r\\nthe day of her death; where it is now, I really donâ\\x80\\x99t know. Heavens!\\r\\nitâ\\x80\\x99s two oâ\\x80\\x99clock! _How_ I have kept you, prince! It is really most\\r\\nunpardonable of me.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general rose.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, not in the least,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince. â\\x80\\x9cOn the contrary, I have been\\r\\nso much interested, Iâ\\x80\\x99m really very much obliged to you.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPrince,â\\x80\\x9d said the general, pressing his hand, and looking at him with\\r\\nflashing eyes, and an expression as though he were under the influence\\r\\nof a sudden thought which had come upon him with stunning force.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPrince, you are so kind, so simple-minded, that sometimes I really\\r\\nfeel sorry for you! I gaze at you with a feeling of real affection. Oh,\\r\\nHeaven bless you! May your life blossom and fructify in love. Mine is\\r\\nover. Forgive me, forgive me!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe left the room quickly, covering his face with his hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince could not doubt the sincerity of his agitation. He\\r\\nunderstood, too, that the old man had left the room intoxicated with\\r\\nhis own success. The general belonged to that class of liars, who, in\\r\\nspite of their transports of lying, invariably suspect that they are\\r\\nnot believed. On this occasion, when he recovered from his exaltation,\\r\\nhe would probably suspect Muishkin of pitying him, and feel insulted.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHave I been acting rightly in allowing him to develop such vast\\r\\nresources of imagination?â\\x80\\x9d the prince asked himself. But his answer was\\r\\na fit of violent laughter which lasted ten whole minutes. He tried to\\r\\nreproach himself for the laughing fit, but eventually concluded that he\\r\\nneednâ\\x80\\x99t do so, since in spite of it he was truly sorry for the old man.\\r\\nThe same evening he received a strange letter, short but decided. The\\r\\ngeneral informed him that they must part for ever; that he was\\r\\ngrateful, but that even from him he could not accept â\\x80\\x9csigns of sympathy\\r\\nwhich were humiliating to the dignity of a man already miserable\\r\\nenough.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the prince heard that the old man had gone to Nina Alexandrovna,\\r\\nthough, he felt almost easy on his account.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have seen, however, that the general paid a visit to Lizabetha\\r\\nProkofievna and caused trouble there, the final upshot being that he\\r\\nfrightened Mrs. Epanchin, and angered her by bitter hints as to his son\\r\\nGania.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had been turned out in disgrace, eventually, and this was the cause\\r\\nof his bad night and quarrelsome day, which ended in his sudden\\r\\ndeparture into the street in a condition approaching insanity, as\\r\\nrecorded before.\\r\\n\\r\\nColia did not understand the position. He tried severity with his\\r\\nfather, as they stood in the street after the latter had cursed the\\r\\nhousehold, hoping to bring him round that way.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, where are we to go to now, father?â\\x80\\x9d he asked. â\\x80\\x9cYou donâ\\x80\\x99t want to\\r\\ngo to the princeâ\\x80\\x99s; you have quarrelled with Lebedeff; you have no\\r\\nmoney; I never have any; and here we are in the middle of the road, in\\r\\na nice sort of mess.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBetter to be of a mess than in a mess! I remember making a joke\\r\\nsomething like that at the mess in eighteen hundred and fortyâ\\x80\\x94fortyâ\\x80\\x94I\\r\\nforget. â\\x80\\x98Where is my youth, where is my golden youth?â\\x80\\x99 Who was it said\\r\\nthat, Colia?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was Gogol, in Dead Souls, father,â\\x80\\x9d cried Colia, glancing at him in\\r\\nsome alarm.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Dead Souls,â\\x80\\x99 yes, of course, dead. When I die, Colia, you must\\r\\nengrave on my tomb:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Here lies a Dead Soul,\\r\\nShame pursues me.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWho said that, Colia?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know, father.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere was no Eropegoff? Eroshka Eropegoff?â\\x80\\x9d he cried, suddenly,\\r\\nstopping in the road in a frenzy. â\\x80\\x9cNo Eropegoff! And my own son to say\\r\\nit! Eropegoff was in the place of a brother to me for eleven months. I\\r\\nfought a duel for him. He was married afterwards, and then killed on\\r\\nthe field of battle. The bullet struck the cross on my breast and\\r\\nglanced off straight into his temple. â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99ll never forget you,â\\x80\\x99 he\\r\\ncried, and expired. I served my country well and honestly, Colia, but\\r\\nshame, shame has pursued me! You and Nina will come to my grave, Colia;\\r\\npoor Nina, I always used to call her Nina in the old days, and how she\\r\\nloved.... Nina, Nina, oh, Nina. What have I ever done to deserve your\\r\\nforgiveness and long-suffering? Oh, Colia, your mother has an angelic\\r\\nspirit, an angelic spirit, Colia!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know that, father. Look here, dear old father, come back home! Letâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ngo back to mother. Look, she ran after us when we came out. What have\\r\\nyou stopped her for, just as though you didnâ\\x80\\x99t take in what I said? Why\\r\\nare you crying, father?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor Colia cried himself, and kissed the old manâ\\x80\\x99s hands\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou kiss my hands, _mine?_â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, yes, yours, yours! What is there to surprise anyone in that?\\r\\nCome, come, you mustnâ\\x80\\x99t go on like this, crying in the middle of the\\r\\nroad; and you a general too, a military man! Come, letâ\\x80\\x99s go back.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGod bless you, dear boy, for being respectful to a disgraced man. Yes,\\r\\nto a poor disgraced old fellow, your father. You shall have such a son\\r\\nyourself; le roi de Rome. Oh, curses on this house!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome, come, what does all this mean?â\\x80\\x9d cried Colia beside himself at\\r\\nlast. â\\x80\\x9cWhat is it? What has happened to you? Why donâ\\x80\\x99t you wish to come\\r\\nback home? Why have you gone out of your mind, like this?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll explain it, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll explain all to you. Donâ\\x80\\x99t shout! You shall hear.\\r\\nLe roi de Rome. Oh, I am sad, I am melancholy!\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Nurse, where is your tomb?â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWho said that, Colia?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know, I donâ\\x80\\x99t know who said it. Come home at once; come on!\\r\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ll punch Ganiaâ\\x80\\x99s head myself, if you likeâ\\x80\\x94only come. Oh, where _are_\\r\\nyou off to again?â\\x80\\x9d The general was dragging him away towards the door\\r\\nof a house nearby. He sat down on the step, still holding Colia by the\\r\\nhand.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBend downâ\\x80\\x94bend down your ear. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you allâ\\x80\\x94disgraceâ\\x80\\x94bend down,\\r\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you in your ear.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat are you dreaming of?â\\x80\\x9d said poor, frightened Colia, stooping down\\r\\ntowards the old man, all the same.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLe roi de Rome,â\\x80\\x9d whispered the general, trembling all over.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat? What _do_ you mean? What roi de Rome?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x94I,â\\x80\\x9d the general continued to whisper, clinging more and more tightly\\r\\nto the boyâ\\x80\\x99s shoulder. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x94wishâ\\x80\\x94to tell youâ\\x80\\x94allâ\\x80\\x94Mariaâ\\x80\\x94Maria\\r\\nPetrovnaâ\\x80\\x94Suâ\\x80\\x94Suâ\\x80\\x94Su.......â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nColia broke loose, seized his father by the shoulders, and stared into\\r\\nhis eyes with frenzied gaze. The old man had grown lividâ\\x80\\x94his lips were\\r\\nshaking, convulsions were passing over his features. Suddenly he leant\\r\\nover and began to sink slowly into Coliaâ\\x80\\x99s arms.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s got a stroke!â\\x80\\x9d cried Colia, loudly, realizing what was the matter\\r\\nat last.\\r\\n\\r\\nV.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn point of fact, Varia had rather exaggerated the certainty of her\\r\\nnews as to the princeâ\\x80\\x99s betrothal to Aglaya. Very likely, with the\\r\\nperspicacity of her sex, she gave out as an accomplished fact what she\\r\\nfelt was pretty sure to become a fact in a few days. Perhaps she could\\r\\nnot resist the satisfaction of pouring one last drop of bitterness into\\r\\nher brother Ganiaâ\\x80\\x99s cup, in spite of her love for him. At all events,\\r\\nshe had been unable to obtain any definite news from the Epanchin\\r\\ngirlsâ\\x80\\x94the most she could get out of them being hints and surmises, and\\r\\nso on. Perhaps Aglayaâ\\x80\\x99s sisters had merely been pumping Varia for news\\r\\nwhile pretending to impart information; or perhaps, again, they had\\r\\nbeen unable to resist the feminine gratification of teasing a\\r\\nfriendâ\\x80\\x94for, after all this time, they could scarcely have helped\\r\\ndivining the aim of her frequent visits.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, the prince, although he had told Lebedeff,â\\x80\\x94as we\\r\\nknow, that nothing had happened, and that he had nothing to impart,â\\x80\\x94the\\r\\nprince may have been in error. Something strange seemed to have\\r\\nhappened, without anything definite having actually happened. Varia had\\r\\nguessed that with her true feminine instinct.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow or why it came about that everyone at the Epanchinsâ\\x80\\x99 became imbued\\r\\nwith one convictionâ\\x80\\x94that something very important had happened to\\r\\nAglaya, and that her fate was in process of settlementâ\\x80\\x94it would be very\\r\\ndifficult to explain. But no sooner had this idea taken root, than all\\r\\nat once declared that they had seen and observed it long ago; that they\\r\\nhad remarked it at the time of the â\\x80\\x9cpoor knightâ\\x80\\x9d joke, and even before,\\r\\nthough they had been unwilling to believe in such nonsense.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo said the sisters. Of course, Lizabetha Prokofievna had foreseen it\\r\\nlong before the rest; her â\\x80\\x9cheart had been soreâ\\x80\\x9d for a long while, she\\r\\ndeclared, and it was now so sore that she appeared to be quite\\r\\noverwhelmed, and the very thought of the prince became distasteful to\\r\\nher.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a question to be decidedâ\\x80\\x94most important, but most difficult;\\r\\nso much so, that Mrs. Epanchin did not even see how to put it into\\r\\nwords. Would the prince do or not? Was all this good or bad? If good\\r\\n(which might be the case, of course), _why_ good? If bad (which was\\r\\nhardly doubtful), _wherein_, especially, bad? Even the general, the\\r\\npaterfamilias, though astonished at first, suddenly declared that,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cupon his honour, he really believed he had fancied something of the\\r\\nkind, after all. At first, it seemed a new idea, and then, somehow, it\\r\\nlooked as familiar as possible.â\\x80\\x9d His wife frowned him down there. This\\r\\nwas in the morning; but in the evening, alone with his wife, he had\\r\\ngiven tongue again.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, really, you knowâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94(silence)â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cof course, you know all this is\\r\\nvery strange, if true, which I cannot deny; butâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94(silence).â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cBut, on\\r\\nthe other hand, if one looks things in the face, you knowâ\\x80\\x94upon my\\r\\nhonour, the prince is a rare good fellowâ\\x80\\x94andâ\\x80\\x94andâ\\x80\\x94andâ\\x80\\x94well, his name,\\r\\nyou knowâ\\x80\\x94your family nameâ\\x80\\x94all this looks well, and perpetuates the name\\r\\nand title and all thatâ\\x80\\x94which at this moment is not standing so high as\\r\\nit mightâ\\x80\\x94from one point of viewâ\\x80\\x94donâ\\x80\\x99t you know? The world, the world is\\r\\nthe world, of courseâ\\x80\\x94and people will talkâ\\x80\\x94andâ\\x80\\x94andâ\\x80\\x94the prince has\\r\\nproperty, you knowâ\\x80\\x94if it is not very largeâ\\x80\\x94and then heâ\\x80\\x94heâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d (Continued\\r\\nsilence, and collapse of the general.)\\r\\n\\r\\nHearing these words from her husband, Lizabetha Prokofievna was driven\\r\\nbeside herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to her opinion, the whole thing had been one huge,\\r\\nfantastical, absurd, unpardonable mistake. â\\x80\\x9cFirst of all, this prince\\r\\nis an idiot, and, secondly, he is a foolâ\\x80\\x94knows nothing of the world,\\r\\nand has no place in it. Whom can he be shown to? Where can you take him\\r\\nto? What will old Bielokonski say? We never thought of such a husband\\r\\nas _that_ for our Aglaya!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, the last argument was the chief one. The maternal heart\\r\\ntrembled with indignation to think of such an absurdity, although in\\r\\nthat heart there rose another voice, which said: â\\x80\\x9cAnd _why_ is not the\\r\\nprince such a husband as you would have desired for Aglaya?â\\x80\\x9d It was\\r\\nthis voice which annoyed Lizabetha Prokofievna more than anything else.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some reason or other, the sisters liked the idea of the prince.\\r\\nThey did not even consider it very strange; in a word, they might be\\r\\nexpected at any moment to range themselves strongly on his side. But\\r\\nboth of them decided to say nothing either way. It had always been\\r\\nnoticed in the family that the stronger Mrs. Epanchinâ\\x80\\x99s opposition was\\r\\nto any project, the nearer she was, in reality, to giving in.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlexandra, however, found it difficult to keep absolute silence on the\\r\\nsubject. Long since holding, as she did, the post of â\\x80\\x9cconfidential\\r\\nadviser to mamma,â\\x80\\x9d she was now perpetually called in council, and asked\\r\\nher opinion, and especially her assistance, in order to recollect â\\x80\\x9chow\\r\\non earth all this happened?â\\x80\\x9d Why did no one see it? Why did no one say\\r\\nanything about it? What did all that wretched â\\x80\\x9cpoor knightâ\\x80\\x9d joke mean?\\r\\nWhy was she, Lizabetha Prokofievna, driven to think, and foresee, and\\r\\nworry for everybody, while they all sucked their thumbs, and counted\\r\\nthe crows in the garden, and did nothing? At first, Alexandra had been\\r\\nvery careful, and had merely replied that perhaps her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s remark\\r\\nwas not so far out: that, in the eyes of the world, probably the choice\\r\\nof the prince as a husband for one of the Epanchin girls would be\\r\\nconsidered a very wise one. Warming up, however, she added that the\\r\\nprince was by no means a fool, and never had been; and that as to\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cplace in the world,â\\x80\\x9d no one knew what the position of a respectable\\r\\nperson in Russia would imply in a few yearsâ\\x80\\x94whether it would depend on\\r\\nsuccesses in the government service, on the old system, or what.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo all this her mother replied that Alexandra was a freethinker, and\\r\\nthat all this was due to that â\\x80\\x9ccursed womanâ\\x80\\x99s rights question.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHalf an hour after this conversation, she went off to town, and thence\\r\\nto the Kammenny Ostrof, [â\\x80\\x9cStone Island,â\\x80\\x9d a suburb and park of St.\\r\\nPetersburg] to see Princess Bielokonski, who had just arrived from\\r\\nMoscow on a short visit. The princess was Aglayaâ\\x80\\x99s godmother.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOld Bielokonskiâ\\x80\\x9d listened to all the fevered and despairing\\r\\nlamentations of Lizabetha Prokofievna without the least emotion; the\\r\\ntears of this sorrowful mother did not evoke answering sighsâ\\x80\\x94in fact,\\r\\nshe laughed at her. She was a dreadful old despot, this princess; she\\r\\ncould not allow equality in anything, not even in friendship of the\\r\\noldest standing, and she insisted on treating Mrs. Epanchin as her\\r\\n_protÃ©gÃ©e_, as she had been thirty-five years ago. She could never put\\r\\nup with the independence and energy of Lizabethaâ\\x80\\x99s character. She\\r\\nobserved that, as usual, the whole family had gone much too far ahead,\\r\\nand had converted a fly into an elephant; that, so far as she had heard\\r\\ntheir story, she was persuaded that nothing of any seriousness had\\r\\noccurred; that it would surely be better to wait until something _did_\\r\\nhappen; that the prince, in her opinion, was a very decent young\\r\\nfellow, though perhaps a little eccentric, through illness, and not\\r\\nquite as weighty in the world as one could wish. The worst feature was,\\r\\nshe said, Nastasia Philipovna.\\r\\n\\r\\nLizabetha Prokofievna well understood that the old lady was angry at\\r\\nthe failure of Evgenie Pavlovitchâ\\x80\\x94her own recommendation. She returned\\r\\nhome to Pavlofsk in a worse humour than when she left, and of course\\r\\neverybody in the house suffered. She pitched into everyone, because,\\r\\nshe declared, they had â\\x80\\x98gone mad.â\\x80\\x99 Why were things always mismanaged in\\r\\nher house? Why had everybody been in such a frantic hurry in this\\r\\nmatter? So far as she could see, nothing whatever had happened. Surely\\r\\nthey had better wait and see what was to happen, instead of making\\r\\nmountains out of molehills.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so the conclusion of the matter was that it would be far better to\\r\\ntake it quietly, and wait coolly to see what would turn up. But, alas!\\r\\npeace did not reign for more than ten minutes. The first blow dealt to\\r\\nits power was in certain news communicated to Lizabetha Prokofievna as\\r\\nto events which had happened during her trip to see the princess. (This\\r\\ntrip had taken place the day after that on which the prince had turned\\r\\nup at the Epanchins at nearly one oâ\\x80\\x99clock at night, thinking it was\\r\\nnine.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sisters replied candidly and fully enough to their motherâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nimpatient questions on her return. They said, in the first place, that\\r\\nnothing particular had happened since her departure; that the prince\\r\\nhad been, and that Aglaya had kept him waiting a long while before she\\r\\nappearedâ\\x80\\x94half an hour, at least; that she had then come in, and\\r\\nimmediately asked the prince to have a game of chess; that the prince\\r\\ndid not know the game, and Aglaya had beaten him easily; that she had\\r\\nbeen in a wonderfully merry mood, and had laughed at the prince, and\\r\\nchaffed him so unmercifully that one was quite sorry to see his\\r\\nwretched expression.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had then asked him to play cardsâ\\x80\\x94the game called â\\x80\\x9clittle fools.â\\x80\\x9d At\\r\\nthis game the tables were turned completely, for the prince had shown\\r\\nhimself a master at it. Aglaya had cheated and changed cards, and\\r\\nstolen others, in the most bare-faced way, but, in spite of everything\\r\\nthe prince had beaten her hopelessly five times running, and she had\\r\\nbeen left â\\x80\\x9clittle foolâ\\x80\\x9d each time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAglaya then lost her temper, and began to say such awful things to the\\r\\nprince that he laughed no more, but grew dreadfully pale, especially\\r\\nwhen she said that she should not remain in the house with him, and\\r\\nthat he ought to be ashamed of coming to their house at all, especially\\r\\nat night, â\\x80\\x9c_after all that had happened_.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo saying, she had left the room, banging the door after her, and the\\r\\nprince went off, looking as though he were on his way to a funeral, in\\r\\nspite of all their attempts at consolation.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly, a quarter of an hour after the princeâ\\x80\\x99s departure, Aglaya had\\r\\nrushed out of her room in such a hurry that she had not even wiped her\\r\\neyes, which were full of tears. She came back because Colia had brought\\r\\na hedgehog. Everybody came in to see the hedgehog. In answer to their\\r\\nquestions Colia explained that the hedgehog was not his, and that he\\r\\nhad left another boy, Kostia Lebedeff, waiting for him outside. Kostia\\r\\nwas too shy to come in, because he was carrying a hatchet; they had\\r\\nbought the hedgehog and the hatchet from a peasant whom they had met on\\r\\nthe road. He had offered to sell them the hedgehog, and they had paid\\r\\nfifty copecks for it; and the hatchet had so taken their fancy that\\r\\nthey had made up their minds to buy it of their own accord. On hearing\\r\\nthis, Aglaya urged Colia to sell her the hedgehog; she even called him\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdear Colia,â\\x80\\x9d in trying to coax him. He refused for a long time, but at\\r\\nlast he could hold out no more, and went to fetch Kostia Lebedeff. The\\r\\nlatter appeared, carrying his hatchet, and covered with confusion. Then\\r\\nit came out that the hedgehog was not theirs, but the property of a\\r\\nschoolmate, one Petroff, who had given them some money to buy\\r\\nSchlosserâ\\x80\\x99s History for him, from another schoolfellow who at that\\r\\nmoment was driven to raising money by the sale of his books. Colia and\\r\\nKostia were about to make this purchase for their friend when chance\\r\\nbrought the hedgehog to their notice, and they had succumbed to the\\r\\ntemptation of buying it. They were now taking Petroff the hedgehog and\\r\\nhatchet which they had bought with his money, instead of Schlosserâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nHistory. But Aglaya so entreated them that at last they consented to\\r\\nsell her the hedgehog. As soon as she had got possession of it, she put\\r\\nit in a wicker basket with Coliaâ\\x80\\x99s help, and covered it with a napkin.\\r\\nThen she said to Colia: â\\x80\\x9cGo and take this hedgehog to the prince from\\r\\nme, and ask him to accept it as a token of my profound respect.â\\x80\\x9d Colia\\r\\njoyfully promised to do the errand, but he demanded explanations. â\\x80\\x9cWhat\\r\\ndoes the hedgehog mean? What is the meaning of such a present?â\\x80\\x9d Aglaya\\r\\nreplied that it was none of his business. â\\x80\\x9cI am sure that there is some\\r\\nallegory about it,â\\x80\\x9d Colia persisted. Aglaya grew angry, and called him\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9ca silly boy.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIf I did not respect all women in your person,â\\x80\\x9d replied\\r\\nColia, â\\x80\\x9cand if my own principles would permit it, I would soon prove to\\r\\nyou, that I know how to answer such an insult!â\\x80\\x9d But, in the end, Colia\\r\\nwent off with the hedgehog in great delight, followed by Kostia\\r\\nLebedeff. Aglayaâ\\x80\\x99s annoyance was soon over, and seeing that Colia was\\r\\nswinging the hedgehogâ\\x80\\x99s basket violently to and fro, she called out to\\r\\nhim from the verandah, as if they had never quarrelled: â\\x80\\x9cColia, dear,\\r\\nplease take care not to drop him!â\\x80\\x9d Colia appeared to have no grudge\\r\\nagainst her, either, for he stopped, and answered most cordially: â\\x80\\x9cNo,\\r\\nI will not drop him! Donâ\\x80\\x99t be afraid, Aglaya Ivanovna!â\\x80\\x9d After which he\\r\\nwent on his way. Aglaya burst out laughing and ran up to her room,\\r\\nhighly delighted. Her good spirits lasted the whole day.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this filled poor Lizabethaâ\\x80\\x99s mind with chaotic confusion. What on\\r\\nearth did it all mean? The most disturbing feature was the hedgehog.\\r\\nWhat was the symbolic signification of a hedgehog? What did they\\r\\nunderstand by it? What underlay it? Was it a cryptic message?\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor General Epanchin â\\x80\\x9cput his foot in itâ\\x80\\x9d by answering the above\\r\\nquestions in his own way. He said there was no cryptic message at all.\\r\\nAs for the hedgehog, it was just a hedgehog, which meant\\r\\nnothingâ\\x80\\x94unless, indeed, it was a pledge of friendship,â\\x80\\x94the sign of\\r\\nforgetting of offences and so on. At all events, it was a joke, and, of\\r\\ncourse, a most pardonable and innocent one.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may as well remark that the general had guessed perfectly\\r\\naccurately.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince, returning home from the interview with Aglaya, had sat\\r\\ngloomy and depressed for half an hour. He was almost in despair when\\r\\nColia arrived with the hedgehog.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the sky cleared in a moment. The prince seemed to arise from the\\r\\ndead; he asked Colia all about it, made him repeat the story over and\\r\\nover again, and laughed and shook hands with the boys in his delight.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seemed clear to the prince that Aglaya forgave him, and that he\\r\\nmight go there again this very evening; and in his eyes that was not\\r\\nonly the main thing, but everything in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat children we are still, Colia!â\\x80\\x9d he cried at last,\\r\\nenthusiastically,â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cand how delightful it is that we can be children\\r\\nstill!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSimplyâ\\x80\\x94my dear prince,â\\x80\\x94simply she is in love with you,â\\x80\\x94thatâ\\x80\\x99s the\\r\\nwhole of the secret!â\\x80\\x9d replied Colia, with authority.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince blushed, but this time he said nothing. Colia burst out\\r\\nlaughing and clapped his hands. A minute later the prince laughed too,\\r\\nand from this moment until the evening he looked at his watch every\\r\\nother minute to see how much time he had to wait before evening came.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the situation was becoming rapidly critical.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Epanchin could bear her suspense no longer, and in spite of the\\r\\nopposition of husband and daughters, she sent for Aglaya, determined to\\r\\nget a straightforward answer out of her, once for all.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOtherwise,â\\x80\\x9d she observed hysterically, â\\x80\\x9cI shall die before evening.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was only now that everyone realized to what a ridiculous dead-lock\\r\\nthe whole matter had been brought. Excepting feigned surprise,\\r\\nindignation, laughter, and jeeringâ\\x80\\x94both at the prince and at everyone\\r\\nwho asked her questions,â\\x80\\x94nothing could be got out of Aglaya.\\r\\n\\r\\nLizabetha Prokofievna went to bed and only rose again in time for tea,\\r\\nwhen the prince might be expected.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe awaited him in trembling agitation; and when he at last arrived she\\r\\nnearly went off into hysterics.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuishkin himself came in very timidly. He seemed to feel his way, and\\r\\nlooked in each personâ\\x80\\x99s eyes in a questioning way,â\\x80\\x94for Aglaya was\\r\\nabsent, which fact alarmed him at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis evening there were no strangers presentâ\\x80\\x94no one but the immediate\\r\\nmembers of the family. Prince S. was still in town, occupied with the\\r\\naffairs of Evgenie Pavlovitchâ\\x80\\x99s uncle.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI wish at least _he_ would come and say something!â\\x80\\x9d complained poor\\r\\nLizabetha Prokofievna.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general sat still with a most preoccupied air. The sisters were\\r\\nlooking very serious and did not speak a word, and Lizabetha\\r\\nProkofievna did not know how to commence the conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length she plunged into an energetic and hostile criticism of\\r\\nrailways, and glared at the prince defiantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlas Aglaya still did not comeâ\\x80\\x94and the prince was quite lost. He had\\r\\nthe greatest difficulty in expressing his opinion that railways were\\r\\nmost useful institutions,â\\x80\\x94and in the middle of his speech Adelaida\\r\\nlaughed, which threw him into a still worse state of confusion.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this moment in marched Aglaya, as calm and collected as could be.\\r\\nShe gave the prince a ceremonious bow and solemnly took up a prominent\\r\\nposition near the big round table. She looked at the prince\\r\\nquestioningly.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll present realized that the moment for the settlement of perplexities\\r\\nhad arrived.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDid you get my hedgehog?â\\x80\\x9d she inquired, firmly and almost angrily.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I got it,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, blushing.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTell us now, at once, what you made of the present? I must have you\\r\\nanswer this question for motherâ\\x80\\x99s sake; she needs pacifying, and so do\\r\\nall the rest of the family!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLook here, Aglayaâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d began the general.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThisâ\\x80\\x94this is going beyond all limits!â\\x80\\x9d said Lizabetha Prokofievna,\\r\\nsuddenly alarmed.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is not in the least beyond all limits, mamma!â\\x80\\x9d said her daughter,\\r\\nfirmly. â\\x80\\x9cI sent the prince a hedgehog this morning, and I wish to hear\\r\\nhis opinion of it. Go on, prince.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x94what sort of opinion, Aglaya Ivanovna?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAbout the hedgehog.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat isâ\\x80\\x94I suppose you wish to know how I received the hedgehog, Aglaya\\r\\nIvanovna,â\\x80\\x94or, I should say, how I regarded your sending him to me? In\\r\\nthat case, I may tell youâ\\x80\\x94in a wordâ\\x80\\x94that Iâ\\x80\\x94in factâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe paused, breathless.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cComeâ\\x80\\x94you havenâ\\x80\\x99t told us much!â\\x80\\x9d said Aglaya, after waiting some five\\r\\nseconds. â\\x80\\x9cVery well, I am ready to drop the hedgehog, if you like; but\\r\\nI am anxious to be able to clear up this accumulation of\\r\\nmisunderstandings. Allow me to ask you, prince,â\\x80\\x94I wish to hear from\\r\\nyou, personallyâ\\x80\\x94are you making me an offer, or not?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGracious heavens!â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Lizabetha Prokofievna. The prince\\r\\nstarted. The general stiffened in his chair; the sisters frowned.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t deceive me now, princeâ\\x80\\x94tell the truth. All these people\\r\\npersecute me with astounding questionsâ\\x80\\x94about you. Is there any ground\\r\\nfor all these questions, or not? Come!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have not asked you to marry me yet, Aglaya Ivanovna,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\r\\nprince, becoming suddenly animated; â\\x80\\x9cbut you know yourself how much I\\r\\nlove you and trust you.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNoâ\\x80\\x94I asked you thisâ\\x80\\x94answer this! Do you intend to ask for my hand, or\\r\\nnot?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYesâ\\x80\\x94I do ask for it!â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, more dead than alive now.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a general stir in the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNoâ\\x80\\x94noâ\\x80\\x94my dear girl,â\\x80\\x9d began the general. â\\x80\\x9cYou cannot proceed like this,\\r\\nAglaya, if thatâ\\x80\\x99s how the matter stands. Itâ\\x80\\x99s impossible. Prince,\\r\\nforgive it, my dear fellow, butâ\\x80\\x94Lizabetha Prokofievna!â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94he appealed to\\r\\nhis spouse for helpâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cyou must reallyâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot Iâ\\x80\\x94not I! I retire from all responsibility,â\\x80\\x9d said Lizabetha\\r\\nProkofievna, with a wave of the hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAllow me to speak, please, mamma,â\\x80\\x9d said Aglaya. â\\x80\\x9cI think I ought to\\r\\nhave something to say in the matter. An important moment of my destiny\\r\\nis about to be decidedâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94(this is how Aglaya expressed herself)â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cand I\\r\\nwish to find out how the matter stands, for my own sake, though I am\\r\\nglad you are all here. Allow me to ask you, prince, since you cherish\\r\\nthose intentions, how you consider that you will provide for my\\r\\nhappiness?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x94I donâ\\x80\\x99t quite know how to answer your question, Aglaya Ivanovna.\\r\\nWhat is there to say to such a question? Andâ\\x80\\x94and must I answer?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think you are rather overwhelmed and out of breath. Have a little\\r\\nrest, and try to recover yourself. Take a glass of water, orâ\\x80\\x94but\\r\\ntheyâ\\x80\\x99ll give you some tea directly.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI love you, Aglaya Ivanovna,â\\x80\\x94I love you very much. I love only\\r\\nyouâ\\x80\\x94andâ\\x80\\x94please donâ\\x80\\x99t jest about it, for I do love you very much.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, this matter is important. We are not childrenâ\\x80\\x94we must look into\\r\\nit thoroughly. Now then, kindly tell meâ\\x80\\x94what does your fortune consist\\r\\nof?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNoâ\\x80\\x94Aglayaâ\\x80\\x94come, enough of this, you mustnâ\\x80\\x99t behave like this,â\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nher father, in dismay.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s disgraceful,â\\x80\\x9d said Lizabetha Prokofievna in a loud whisper.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSheâ\\x80\\x99s madâ\\x80\\x94quite!â\\x80\\x9d said Alexandra.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFortuneâ\\x80\\x94moneyâ\\x80\\x94do you mean?â\\x80\\x9d asked the prince in some surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cJust so.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have nowâ\\x80\\x94letâ\\x80\\x99s seeâ\\x80\\x94I have a hundred and thirty-five thousand\\r\\nroubles,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, blushing violently.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs that all, really?â\\x80\\x9d said Aglaya, candidly, without the slightest\\r\\nshow of confusion. â\\x80\\x9cHowever, itâ\\x80\\x99s not so bad, especially if managed\\r\\nwith economy. Do you intend to serve?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x94I intended to try for a certificate as private tutor.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery good. That would increase our income nicely. Have you any\\r\\nintention of being a Kammer-junker?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA Kammer-junker? I had not thought of it, butâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut here the two sisters could restrain themselves no longer, and both\\r\\nof them burst into irrepressible laughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdelaida had long since detected in Aglayaâ\\x80\\x99s features the gathering\\r\\nsigns of an approaching storm of laughter, which she restrained with\\r\\namazing self-control.\\r\\n\\r\\nAglaya looked menacingly at her laughing sisters, but could not contain\\r\\nherself any longer, and the next minute she too had burst into an\\r\\nirrepressible, and almost hysterical, fit of mirth. At length she\\r\\njumped up, and ran out of the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI knew it was all a joke!â\\x80\\x9d cried Adelaida. â\\x80\\x9cI felt it ever sinceâ\\x80\\x94since\\r\\nthe hedgehog.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, no! I cannot allow this,â\\x80\\x94this is a little too much,â\\x80\\x9d cried\\r\\nLizabetha Prokofievna, exploding with rage, and she rose from her seat\\r\\nand followed Aglaya out of the room as quickly as she could.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two sisters hurriedly went after her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince and the general were the only two persons left in the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99sâ\\x80\\x94itâ\\x80\\x99s reallyâ\\x80\\x94now could you have imagined anything like it, Lef\\r\\nNicolaievitch?â\\x80\\x9d cried the general. He was evidently so much agitated\\r\\nthat he hardly knew what he wished to say. â\\x80\\x9cSeriously now, seriously I\\r\\nmeanâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI only see that Aglaya Ivanovna is laughing at me,â\\x80\\x9d said the poor\\r\\nprince, sadly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWait a bit, my boy, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll just goâ\\x80\\x94you stay here, you know. But do just\\r\\nexplain, if you can, Lef Nicolaievitch, how in the world has all this\\r\\ncome about? And what does it all mean? You must understand, my dear\\r\\nfellow; I am a father, you see, and I ought to be allowed to understand\\r\\nthe matterâ\\x80\\x94do explain, I beg you!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI love Aglaya Ivanovnaâ\\x80\\x94she knows it,â\\x80\\x94and I think she must have long\\r\\nknown it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general shrugged his shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cStrangeâ\\x80\\x94itâ\\x80\\x99s strange,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cand you love her very much?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, very much.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWellâ\\x80\\x94itâ\\x80\\x99s all most strange to me. That isâ\\x80\\x94my dear fellow, it is such a\\r\\nsurpriseâ\\x80\\x94such a blowâ\\x80\\x94that... You see, it is not your financial position\\r\\n(though I should not object if you were a bit richer)â\\x80\\x94I am thinking of\\r\\nmy daughterâ\\x80\\x99s happiness, of course, and the thing isâ\\x80\\x94are you able to\\r\\ngive her the happiness she deserves? And thenâ\\x80\\x94is all this a joke on her\\r\\npart, or is she in earnest? I donâ\\x80\\x99t mean on your side, but on hers.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this moment Alexandraâ\\x80\\x99s voice was heard outside the door, calling\\r\\nout â\\x80\\x9cPapa!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWait for me here, my boyâ\\x80\\x94will you? Just wait and think it all over,\\r\\nand Iâ\\x80\\x99ll come back directly,â\\x80\\x9d he said hurriedly, and made off with what\\r\\nlooked like the rapidity of alarm in response to Alexandraâ\\x80\\x99s call.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe found the mother and daughter locked in one anotherâ\\x80\\x99s arms, mingling\\r\\ntheir tears.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese were the tears of joy and peace and reconciliation. Aglaya was\\r\\nkissing her motherâ\\x80\\x99s lips and cheeks and hands; they were hugging each\\r\\nother in the most ardent way.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere, look at her nowâ\\x80\\x94Ivan Fedorovitch! Here she isâ\\x80\\x94all of her! This\\r\\nis our _real_ Aglaya at last!â\\x80\\x9d said Lizabetha Prokofievna.\\r\\n\\r\\nAglaya raised her happy, tearful face from her motherâ\\x80\\x99s breast, glanced\\r\\nat her father, and burst out laughing. She sprang at him and hugged him\\r\\ntoo, and kissed him over and over again. She then rushed back to her\\r\\nmother and hid her face in the maternal bosom, and there indulged in\\r\\nmore tears. Her mother covered her with a corner of her shawl.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, you cruel little girl! How will you treat us all next, I wonder?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nshe said, but she spoke with a ring of joy in her voice, and as though\\r\\nshe breathed at last without the oppression which she had felt so long.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCruel?â\\x80\\x9d sobbed Aglaya. â\\x80\\x9cYes, I _am_ cruel, and worthless, and\\r\\nspoiledâ\\x80\\x94tell father so,â\\x80\\x94oh, here he isâ\\x80\\x94I forgot Father, listen!â\\x80\\x9d She\\r\\nlaughed through her tears.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy darling, my little idol,â\\x80\\x9d cried the general, kissing and fondling\\r\\nher hands (Aglaya did not draw them away); â\\x80\\x9cso you love this young man,\\r\\ndo you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, no, no, canâ\\x80\\x99t _bear_ him, I canâ\\x80\\x99t _bear_ your young man!â\\x80\\x9d cried\\r\\nAglaya, raising her head. â\\x80\\x9cAnd if you dare say that _once_ more,\\r\\npapaâ\\x80\\x94Iâ\\x80\\x99m serious, you know, Iâ\\x80\\x99m,â\\x80\\x94do you hear meâ\\x80\\x94Iâ\\x80\\x99m serious!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe certainly did seem to be serious enough. She had flushed up all\\r\\nover and her eyes were blazing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general felt troubled and remained silent, while Lizabetha\\r\\nProkofievna telegraphed to him from behind Aglaya to ask no questions.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf thatâ\\x80\\x99s the case, darlingâ\\x80\\x94then, of course, you shall do exactly as\\r\\nyou like. He is waiting alone downstairs. Hadnâ\\x80\\x99t I better hint to him\\r\\ngently that he can go?â\\x80\\x9d The general telegraphed to Lizabetha\\r\\nProkofievna in his turn.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, no, you neednâ\\x80\\x99t do anything of the sort; you mustnâ\\x80\\x99t hint gently\\r\\nat all. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll go down myself directly. I wish to apologize to this young\\r\\nman, because I hurt his feelings.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, _seriously_,â\\x80\\x9d said the general, gravely.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, youâ\\x80\\x99d better stay here, all of you, for a little, and Iâ\\x80\\x99ll go\\r\\ndown to him alone to begin with. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll just go in and then you can\\r\\nfollow me almost at once. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s the best way.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had almost reached the door when she turned round again.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI shall laughâ\\x80\\x94I know I shall; I shall die of laughing,â\\x80\\x9d she said,\\r\\nlugubriously.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, she turned and ran down to the prince as fast as her feet\\r\\ncould carry her.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, what does it all mean? What do you make of it?â\\x80\\x9d asked the\\r\\ngeneral of his spouse, hurriedly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI hardly dare say,â\\x80\\x9d said Lizabetha, as hurriedly, â\\x80\\x9cbut I think itâ\\x80\\x99s as\\r\\nplain as anything can be.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think so too, as clear as day; she loves him.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLoves him? She is head over ears in love, thatâ\\x80\\x99s what she is,â\\x80\\x9d put in\\r\\nAlexandra.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, God bless her, God bless her, if such is her destiny,â\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nLizabetha, crossing herself devoutly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHâ\\x80\\x99m destiny it is,â\\x80\\x9d said the general, â\\x80\\x9cand thereâ\\x80\\x99s no getting out of\\r\\ndestiny.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWith these words they all moved off towards the drawing-room, where\\r\\nanother surprise awaited them. Aglaya had not only not laughed, as she\\r\\nhad feared, but had gone to the prince rather timidly, and said to him:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cForgive a silly, horrid, spoilt girlâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94(she took his hand here)â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cand be\\r\\nquite assured that we all of us esteem you beyond all words. And if I\\r\\ndared to turn your beautiful, admirable simplicity to ridicule, forgive\\r\\nme as you would a little child its mischief. Forgive me all my\\r\\nabsurdity of just now, which, of course, meant nothing, and could not\\r\\nhave the slightest consequence.â\\x80\\x9d She spoke these words with great\\r\\nemphasis.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer father, mother, and sisters came into the room and were much struck\\r\\nwith the last words, which they just caught as they enteredâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cabsurdity\\r\\nwhich of course meant nothingâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94and still more so with the emphasis with\\r\\nwhich Aglaya had spoken.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey exchanged glances questioningly, but the prince did not seem to\\r\\nhave understood the meaning of Aglayaâ\\x80\\x99s words; he was in the highest\\r\\nheaven of delight.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy do you speak so?â\\x80\\x9d he murmured. â\\x80\\x9cWhy do you ask my forgiveness?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe wished to add that he was unworthy of being asked for forgiveness by\\r\\nher, but paused. Perhaps he did understand Aglayaâ\\x80\\x99s sentence about\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cabsurdity which meant nothing,â\\x80\\x9d and like the strange fellow that he\\r\\nwas, rejoiced in the words.\\r\\n\\r\\nUndoubtedly the fact that he might now come and see Aglaya as much as\\r\\nhe pleased again was quite enough to make him perfectly happy; that he\\r\\nmight come and speak to her, and see her, and sit by her, and walk with\\r\\nherâ\\x80\\x94who knows, but that all this was quite enough to satisfy him for\\r\\nthe whole of his life, and that he would desire no more to the end of\\r\\ntime?\\r\\n\\r\\n(Lizabetha Prokofievna felt that this might be the case, and she didnâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nlike it; though very probably she could not have put the idea into\\r\\nwords.)\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would be difficult to describe the animation and high spirits which\\r\\ndistinguished the prince for the rest of the evening.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was so happy that â\\x80\\x9cit made one feel happy to look at him,â\\x80\\x9d as\\r\\nAglayaâ\\x80\\x99s sisters expressed it afterwards. He talked, and told stories\\r\\njust as he had done once before, and never since, namely on the very\\r\\nfirst morning of his acquaintance with the Epanchins, six months ago.\\r\\nSince his return to Petersburg from Moscow, he had been remarkably\\r\\nsilent, and had told Prince S. on one occasion, before everyone, that\\r\\nhe did not think himself justified in degrading any thought by his\\r\\nunworthy words.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this evening he did nearly all the talking himself, and told\\r\\nstories by the dozen, while he answered all questions put to him\\r\\nclearly, gladly, and with any amount of detail.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was nothing, however, of love-making in his talk. His ideas were\\r\\nall of the most serious kind; some were even mystical and profound.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe aired his own views on various matters, some of his most private\\r\\nopinions and observations, many of which would have seemed rather\\r\\nfunny, so his hearers agreed afterwards, had they not been so well\\r\\nexpressed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general liked serious subjects of conversation; but both he and\\r\\nLizabetha Prokofievna felt that they were having a little too much of a\\r\\ngood thing tonight, and as the evening advanced, they both grew more or\\r\\nless melancholy; but towards night, the prince fell to telling funny\\r\\nstories, and was always the first to burst out laughing himself, which\\r\\nhe invariably did so joyously and simply that the rest laughed just as\\r\\nmuch at him as at his stories.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for Aglaya, she hardly said a word all the evening; but she listened\\r\\nwith all her ears to Lef Nicolaievitchâ\\x80\\x99s talk, and scarcely took her\\r\\neyes off him.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe looked at him, and stared and stared, and hung on every word he\\r\\nsaid,â\\x80\\x9d said Lizabetha afterwards, to her husband, â\\x80\\x9cand yet, tell her\\r\\nthat she loves him, and she is furious!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s to be done? Itâ\\x80\\x99s fate,â\\x80\\x9d said the general, shrugging his\\r\\nshoulders, and, for a long while after, he continued to repeat: â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nfate, itâ\\x80\\x99s fate!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may add that to a business man like General Epanchin the present\\r\\nposition of affairs was most unsatisfactory. He hated the uncertainty\\r\\nin which they had been, perforce, left. However, he decided to say no\\r\\nmore about it, and merely to look on, and take his time and tune from\\r\\nLizabetha Prokofievna.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe happy state in which the family had spent the evening, as just\\r\\nrecorded, was not of very long duration. Next day Aglaya quarrelled\\r\\nwith the prince again, and so she continued to behave for the next few\\r\\ndays. For whole hours at a time she ridiculed and chaffed the wretched\\r\\nman, and made him almost a laughing-stock.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is true that they used to sit in the little summer-house together\\r\\nfor an hour or two at a time, very often, but it was observed that on\\r\\nthese occasions the prince would read the paper, or some book, aloud to\\r\\nAglaya.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you know,â\\x80\\x9d Aglaya said to him once, interrupting the reading, â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve\\r\\nremarked that you are dreadfully badly educated. You never know\\r\\nanything thoroughly, if one asks you; neither anyoneâ\\x80\\x99s name, nor dates,\\r\\nnor about treaties and so on. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a great pity, you know!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI told you I had not had much of an education,â\\x80\\x9d replied the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow am I to respect you, if thatâ\\x80\\x99s the case? Read on now. Noâ\\x80\\x94donâ\\x80\\x99t!\\r\\nStop reading!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd once more, that same evening, Aglaya mystified them all. Prince S.\\r\\nhad returned, and Aglaya was particularly amiable to him, and asked a\\r\\ngreat deal after Evgenie Pavlovitch. (Muishkin had not come in as yet.)\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly Prince S. hinted something about â\\x80\\x9ca new and approaching change\\r\\nin the family.â\\x80\\x9d He was led to this remark by a communication\\r\\ninadvertently made to him by Lizabetha Prokofievna, that Adelaidaâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nmarriage must be postponed a little longer, in order that the two\\r\\nweddings might come off together.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is impossible to describe Aglayaâ\\x80\\x99s irritation. She flared up, and\\r\\nsaid some indignant words about â\\x80\\x9call these silly insinuations.â\\x80\\x9d She\\r\\nadded that â\\x80\\x9cshe had no intentions as yet of replacing anybodyâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nmistress.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThese words painfully impressed the whole party; but especially her\\r\\nparents. Lizabetha Prokofievna summoned a secret council of two, and\\r\\ninsisted upon the generalâ\\x80\\x99s demanding from the prince a full\\r\\nexplanation of his relations with Nastasia Philipovna. The general\\r\\nargued that it was only a whim of Aglayaâ\\x80\\x99s; and that, had not Prince S.\\r\\nunfortunately made that remark, which had confused the child and made\\r\\nher blush, she never would have said what she did; and that he was sure\\r\\nAglaya knew well that anything she might have heard of the prince and\\r\\nNastasia Philipovna was merely the fabrication of malicious tongues,\\r\\nand that the woman was going to marry Rogojin. He insisted that the\\r\\nprince had nothing whatever to do with Nastasia Philipovna, so far as\\r\\nany liaison was concerned; and, if the truth were to be told about it,\\r\\nhe added, never had had.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile nothing put the prince out, and he continued to be in the\\r\\nseventh heaven of bliss. Of course he could not fail to observe some\\r\\nimpatience and ill-temper in Aglaya now and then; but he believed in\\r\\nsomething else, and nothing could now shake his conviction. Besides,\\r\\nAglayaâ\\x80\\x99s frowns never lasted long; they disappeared of themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps he was too easy in his mind. So thought Hippolyte, at all\\r\\nevents, who met him in the park one day.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDidnâ\\x80\\x99t I tell you the truth now, when I said you were in love?â\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nsaid, coming up to Muishkin of his own accord, and stopping him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince gave him his hand and congratulated him upon â\\x80\\x9clooking so\\r\\nwell.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHippolyte himself seemed to be hopeful about his state of health, as is\\r\\noften the case with consumptives.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had approached the prince with the intention of talking\\r\\nsarcastically about his happy expression of face, but very soon forgot\\r\\nhis intention and began to talk about himself. He began complaining\\r\\nabout everything, disconnectedly and endlessly, as was his wont.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t believe,â\\x80\\x9d he concluded, â\\x80\\x9chow irritating they all are\\r\\nthere. They are such wretchedly small, vain, egotistical, _commonplace_\\r\\npeople! Would you believe it, they invited me there under the express\\r\\ncondition that I should die quickly, and they are all as wild as\\r\\npossible with me for not having died yet, and for being, on the\\r\\ncontrary, a good deal better! Isnâ\\x80\\x99t it a comedy? I donâ\\x80\\x99t mind betting\\r\\nthat you donâ\\x80\\x99t believe me!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince said nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI sometimes think of coming over to you again,â\\x80\\x9d said Hippolyte,\\r\\ncarelessly. â\\x80\\x9cSo you _donâ\\x80\\x99t_ think them capable of inviting a man on the\\r\\ncondition that he is to look sharp and die?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI certainly thought they invited you with quite other views.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHo, ho! you are not nearly so simple as they try to make you out! This\\r\\nis not the time for it, or I would tell you a thing or two about that\\r\\nbeauty, Gania, and his hopes. You are being undermined, pitilessly\\r\\nundermined, andâ\\x80\\x94and it is really melancholy to see you so calm about\\r\\nit. But alas! itâ\\x80\\x99s your natureâ\\x80\\x94you canâ\\x80\\x99t help it!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy word! what a thing to be melancholy about! Why, do you think I\\r\\nshould be any happier if I were to feel disturbed about the excavations\\r\\nyou tell me of?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is better to be unhappy and know the worst, than to be happy in a\\r\\nfoolâ\\x80\\x99s paradise! I suppose you donâ\\x80\\x99t believe that you have a rival in\\r\\nthat quarter?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYour insinuations as to rivalry are rather cynical, Hippolyte. Iâ\\x80\\x99m\\r\\nsorry to say I have no right to answer you! As for Gania, I put it to\\r\\nyou, _can_ any man have a happy mind after passing through what he has\\r\\nhad to suffer? I think that is the best way to look at it. He will\\r\\nchange yet, he has lots of time before him, and life is rich;\\r\\nbesidesâ\\x80\\x94besides...â\\x80\\x9d the prince hesitated. â\\x80\\x9cAs to being undermined, I\\r\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t know what in the world you are driving at, Hippolyte. I think we\\r\\nhad better drop the subject!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery well, weâ\\x80\\x99ll drop it for a while. You canâ\\x80\\x99t look at anything but\\r\\nin your exalted, generous way. You must put out your finger and touch a\\r\\nthing before youâ\\x80\\x99ll believe it, eh? Ha! ha! ha! I suppose you despise\\r\\nme dreadfully, prince, eh? What do you think?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy? Because you have suffered more than we have?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo; because I am unworthy of my sufferings, if you like!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhoever _can_ suffer is worthy to suffer, I should think. Aglaya\\r\\nIvanovna wished to see you, after she had read your confession, butâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe postponed the pleasureâ\\x80\\x94I seeâ\\x80\\x94I quite understand!â\\x80\\x9d said Hippolyte,\\r\\nhurriedly, as though he wished to banish the subject. â\\x80\\x9cI hearâ\\x80\\x94they tell\\r\\nmeâ\\x80\\x94that you read her all that nonsense aloud? Stupid bosh it\\r\\nwasâ\\x80\\x94written in delirium. And I canâ\\x80\\x99t understand how anyone can be soâ\\x80\\x94I\\r\\nwonâ\\x80\\x99t say _cruel_, because the word would be humiliating to myself, but\\r\\nweâ\\x80\\x99ll say childishly vain and revengeful, as to _reproach_ me with this\\r\\nconfession, and use it as a weapon against me. Donâ\\x80\\x99t be afraid, Iâ\\x80\\x99m not\\r\\nreferring to yourself.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, but Iâ\\x80\\x99m sorry you repudiate the confession, Hippolyteâ\\x80\\x94it is\\r\\nsincere; and, do you know, even the absurd parts of itâ\\x80\\x94and these are\\r\\nmanyâ\\x80\\x9d (here Hippolyte frowned savagely) â\\x80\\x9care, as it were, redeemed by\\r\\nsufferingâ\\x80\\x94for it must have cost you something to admit what you there\\r\\nsayâ\\x80\\x94great torture, perhaps, for all I know. Your motive must have been\\r\\na very noble one all through. Whatever may have appeared to the\\r\\ncontrary, I give you my word, I see this more plainly every day. I do\\r\\nnot judge you; I merely say this to have it off my mind, and I am only\\r\\nsorry that I did not say it all _then_â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHippolyte flushed hotly. He had thought at first that the prince was\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9chumbuggingâ\\x80\\x9d him; but on looking at his face he saw that he was\\r\\nabsolutely serious, and had no thought of any deception. Hippolyte\\r\\nbeamed with gratification.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd yet I must die,â\\x80\\x9d he said, and almost added: â\\x80\\x9ca man like me!\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd imagine how that Gania annoys me! He has developed the ideaâ\\x80\\x94or\\r\\npretends to believeâ\\x80\\x94that in all probability three or four others who\\r\\nheard my confession will die before I do. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s an idea for youâ\\x80\\x94and\\r\\nall this by way of _consoling_ me! Ha! ha! ha! In the first place they\\r\\nhavenâ\\x80\\x99t died yet; and in the second, if they _did_ dieâ\\x80\\x94all of themâ\\x80\\x94what\\r\\nwould be the satisfaction to me in that? He judges me by himself. But\\r\\nhe goes further, he actually pitches into me because, as he declares,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98any decent fellowâ\\x80\\x99 would die quietly, and that â\\x80\\x98all thisâ\\x80\\x99 is mere\\r\\negotism on my part. He doesnâ\\x80\\x99t see what refinement of egotism it is on\\r\\nhis own partâ\\x80\\x94and at the same time, what ox-like coarseness! Have you\\r\\never read of the death of one Stepan Gleboff, in the eighteenth\\r\\ncentury? I read of it yesterday by chance.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWho was he?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe was impaled on a stake in the time of Peter.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know, I know! He lay there fifteen hours in the hard frost, and died\\r\\nwith the most extraordinary fortitudeâ\\x80\\x94I knowâ\\x80\\x94what of him?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOnly that God gives that sort of dying to some, and not to others.\\r\\nPerhaps you think, though, that I could not die like Gleboff?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot at all!â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, blushing. â\\x80\\x9cI was only going to say that\\r\\nyouâ\\x80\\x94not that you could not be like Gleboffâ\\x80\\x94but that you would have been\\r\\nmore likeâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI guess what you meanâ\\x80\\x94I should be an Osterman, not a Gleboffâ\\x80\\x94eh? Is\\r\\nthat what you meant?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat Osterman?â\\x80\\x9d asked the prince in some surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, Ostermanâ\\x80\\x94the diplomatist. Peterâ\\x80\\x99s Osterman,â\\x80\\x9d muttered Hippolyte,\\r\\nconfused. There was a momentâ\\x80\\x99s pause of mutual confusion.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, no, no!â\\x80\\x9d said the prince at last, â\\x80\\x9cthat was not what I was going\\r\\nto sayâ\\x80\\x94oh no! I donâ\\x80\\x99t think you would ever have been like Osterman.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHippolyte frowned gloomily.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you why I draw the conclusion,â\\x80\\x9d explained the prince,\\r\\nevidently desirous of clearing up the matter a little. â\\x80\\x9cBecause, though\\r\\nI often think over the men of those times, I cannot for the life of me\\r\\nimagine them to be like ourselves. It really appears to me that they\\r\\nwere of another race altogether than ourselves of today. At that time\\r\\npeople seemed to stick so to one idea; now, they are more nervous, more\\r\\nsensitive, more enlightenedâ\\x80\\x94people of two or three ideas at onceâ\\x80\\x94as it\\r\\nwere. The man of today is a broader man, so to speakâ\\x80\\x94and I declare I\\r\\nbelieve that is what prevents him from being so self-contained and\\r\\nindependent a being as his brother of those earlier days. Of course my\\r\\nremark was only made under this impression, and not in the leastâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI quite understand. You are trying to comfort me for the naiveness\\r\\nwith which you disagreed with meâ\\x80\\x94eh? Ha! ha! ha! You are a regular\\r\\nchild, prince! However, I cannot help seeing that you always treat me\\r\\nlikeâ\\x80\\x94like a fragile china cup. Never mind, never mind, Iâ\\x80\\x99m not a bit\\r\\nangry! At all events we have had a very funny talk. Do you know, all\\r\\nthings considered, I should like to be something better than Osterman!\\r\\nI wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t take the trouble to rise from the dead to be an Osterman.\\r\\nHowever, I see I must make arrangements to die soon, or I myselfâ\\x80\\x94.\\r\\nWellâ\\x80\\x94leave me now! _Au revoir._ Look hereâ\\x80\\x94before you go, just give me\\r\\nyour opinion: how do you think I ought to die, now? I meanâ\\x80\\x94the best,\\r\\nthe most virtuous way? Tell me!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou should pass us by and forgive us our happiness,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince\\r\\nin a low voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHa! ha! ha! I thought so. I thought I should hear something like that.\\r\\nWell, you areâ\\x80\\x94you really areâ\\x80\\x94oh dear me! Eloquence, eloquence!\\r\\nGood-bye!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nVI.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to the evening party at the Epanchinsâ\\x80\\x99 at which Princess Bielokonski\\r\\nwas to be present, Varia had reported with accuracy; though she had\\r\\nperhaps expressed herself too strongly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe thing was decided in a hurry and with a certain amount of quite\\r\\nunnecessary excitement, doubtless because â\\x80\\x9cnothing could be done in\\r\\nthis house like anywhere else.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe impatience of Lizabetha Prokofievna â\\x80\\x9cto get things settledâ\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nexplained a good deal, as well as the anxiety of both parents for the\\r\\nhappiness of their beloved daughter. Besides, Princess Bielokonski was\\r\\ngoing away soon, and they hoped that she would take an interest in the\\r\\nprince. They were anxious that he should enter society under the\\r\\nauspices of this lady, whose patronage was the best of recommendations\\r\\nfor any young man.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven if there seems something strange about the match, the general and\\r\\nhis wife said to each other, the â\\x80\\x9cworldâ\\x80\\x9d will accept Aglayaâ\\x80\\x99s fiance\\r\\nwithout any question if he is under the patronage of the princess. In\\r\\nany case, the prince would have to be â\\x80\\x9cshownâ\\x80\\x9d sooner or later; that is,\\r\\nintroduced into society, of which he had, so far, not the least idea.\\r\\nMoreover, it was only a question of a small gathering of a few intimate\\r\\nfriends. Besides Princess Bielokonski, only one other lady was\\r\\nexpected, the wife of a high dignitary. Evgenie Pavlovitch, who was to\\r\\nescort the princess, was the only young man.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuishkin was told of the princessâ\\x80\\x99s visit three days beforehand, but\\r\\nnothing was said to him about the party until the night before it was\\r\\nto take place.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe could not help observing the excited and agitated condition of all\\r\\nmembers of the family, and from certain hints dropped in conversation\\r\\nhe gathered that they were all anxious as to the impression he should\\r\\nmake upon the princess. But the Epanchins, one and all, believed that\\r\\nMuishkin, in his simplicity of mind, was quite incapable of realizing\\r\\nthat they could be feeling any anxiety on his account, and for this\\r\\nreason they all looked at him with dread and uneasiness.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn point of fact, he did attach marvellously little importance to the\\r\\napproaching event. He was occupied with altogether different thoughts.\\r\\nAglaya was growing hourly more capricious and gloomy, and this\\r\\ndistressed him. When they told him that Evgenie Pavlovitch was\\r\\nexpected, he evinced great delight, and said that he had long wished to\\r\\nsee himâ\\x80\\x94and somehow these words did not please anyone.\\r\\n\\r\\nAglaya left the room in a fit of irritation, and it was not until late\\r\\nin the evening, past eleven, when the prince was taking his departure,\\r\\nthat she said a word or two to him, privately, as she accompanied him\\r\\nas far as the front door.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI should like you,â\\x80\\x9d she said, â\\x80\\x9cnot to come here tomorrow until\\r\\nevening, when the guests are all assembled. You know there are to be\\r\\nguests, donâ\\x80\\x99t you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe spoke impatiently and with severity; this was the first allusion\\r\\nshe had made to the party of tomorrow.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe hated the idea of it, everyone saw that; and she would probably\\r\\nhave liked to quarrel about it with her parents, but pride and modesty\\r\\nprevented her from broaching the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince jumped to the conclusion that Aglaya, too, was nervous about\\r\\nhim, and the impression he would make, and that she did not like to\\r\\nadmit her anxiety; and this thought alarmed him.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I am invited,â\\x80\\x9d he replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was evidently in difficulties as to how best to go on. â\\x80\\x9cMay I speak\\r\\nof something serious to you, for once in my life?â\\x80\\x9d she asked, angrily.\\r\\nShe was irritated at she knew not what, and could not restrain her\\r\\nwrath.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course you may; I am very glad to listen,â\\x80\\x9d replied Muishkin.\\r\\n\\r\\nAglaya was silent a moment and then began again with evident dislike of\\r\\nher subject:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI do not wish to quarrel with them about this; in some things they\\r\\nwonâ\\x80\\x99t be reasonable. I always did feel a loathing for the laws which\\r\\nseem to guide mammaâ\\x80\\x99s conduct at times. I donâ\\x80\\x99t speak of father, for he\\r\\ncannot be expected to be anything but what he is. Mother is a\\r\\nnoble-minded woman, I know; you try to suggest anything mean to her,\\r\\nand youâ\\x80\\x99ll see! But she is such a slave to these miserable creatures! I\\r\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t mean old Bielokonski alone. She is a contemptible old thing, but\\r\\nshe is able to twist people round her little finger, and I admire that\\r\\nin her, at all events! How mean it all is, and how foolish! We were\\r\\nalways middle-class, thoroughly middle-class, people. Why should we\\r\\nattempt to climb into the giddy heights of the fashionable world? My\\r\\nsisters are all for it. Itâ\\x80\\x99s Prince S. they have to thank for poisoning\\r\\ntheir minds. Why are you so glad that Evgenie Pavlovitch is coming?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cListen to me, Aglaya,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, â\\x80\\x9cI do believe you are nervous\\r\\nlest I shall make a fool of myself tomorrow at your party?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNervous about you?â\\x80\\x9d Aglaya blushed. â\\x80\\x9cWhy should I be nervous about\\r\\nyou? What would it matter to me if you were to make ever such a fool of\\r\\nyourself? How can you say such a thing? What do you mean by â\\x80\\x98making a\\r\\nfool of yourselfâ\\x80\\x99? What a vulgar expression! I suppose you intend to\\r\\ntalk in that sort of way tomorrow evening? Look up a few more such\\r\\nexpressions in your dictionary; do, youâ\\x80\\x99ll make a grand effect! Iâ\\x80\\x99m\\r\\nsorry that you seem to be able to come into a room as gracefully as you\\r\\ndo; where did you learn the art? Do you think you can drink a cup of\\r\\ntea decently, when you know everybody is looking at you, on purpose to\\r\\nsee how you do it?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I think I can.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCan you? Iâ\\x80\\x99m sorry for it then, for I should have had a good laugh at\\r\\nyou otherwise. Do break _something_ at least, in the drawing-room!\\r\\nUpset the Chinese vase, wonâ\\x80\\x99t you? Itâ\\x80\\x99s a valuable one; _do_ break it.\\r\\nMamma values it, and sheâ\\x80\\x99ll go out of her mindâ\\x80\\x94it was a present. Sheâ\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\ncry before everyone, youâ\\x80\\x99ll see! Wave your hand about, you know, as you\\r\\nalways do, and just smash it. Sit down near it on purpose.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOn the contrary, I shall sit as far from it as I can. Thanks for the\\r\\nhint.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHa, ha! Then you are afraid you _will_ wave your arms about! I\\r\\nwouldnâ\\x80\\x99t mind betting that youâ\\x80\\x99ll talk about some lofty subject,\\r\\nsomething serious and learned. How delightful, how tactful that will\\r\\nbe!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI should think it would be very foolish indeed, unless it happened to\\r\\ncome in appropriately.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLook here, once for all,â\\x80\\x9d cried Aglaya, boiling over, â\\x80\\x9cif I hear you\\r\\ntalking about capital punishment, or the economical condition of\\r\\nRussia, or about Beauty redeeming the world, or anything of that sort,\\r\\nIâ\\x80\\x99llâ\\x80\\x94well, of course I shall laugh and seem very pleased, but I warn\\r\\nyou beforehand, donâ\\x80\\x99t look me in the face again! Iâ\\x80\\x99m serious now, mind,\\r\\nthis time I _am really_ serious.â\\x80\\x9d She certainly did say this very\\r\\nseriously, so much so, that she looked quite different from what she\\r\\nusually was, and the prince could not help noticing the fact. She did\\r\\nnot seem to be joking in the slightest degree.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, youâ\\x80\\x99ve put me into such a fright that I shall certainly make a\\r\\nfool of myself, and very likely break something too. I wasnâ\\x80\\x99t a bit\\r\\nalarmed before, but now Iâ\\x80\\x99m as nervous as can be.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen donâ\\x80\\x99t speak at all. Sit still and donâ\\x80\\x99t talk.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, I canâ\\x80\\x99t do that, you know! I shall say something foolish out of\\r\\npure â\\x80\\x98funk,â\\x80\\x99 and break something for the same excellent reason; I know\\r\\nI shall. Perhaps I shall slip and fall on the slippery floor; Iâ\\x80\\x99ve done\\r\\nthat before now, you know. I shall dream of it all night now. Why did\\r\\nyou say anything about it?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAglaya looked blackly at him.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you know what, I had better not come at all tomorrow! Iâ\\x80\\x99ll plead\\r\\nsick-list and stay away,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, with decision.\\r\\n\\r\\nAglaya stamped her foot, and grew quite pale with anger.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, my goodness! Just listen to that! â\\x80\\x98Better not come,â\\x80\\x99 when the\\r\\nparty is on purpose for him! Good Lord! What a delightful thing it is\\r\\nto have to do with such aâ\\x80\\x94such a stupid as you are!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll come, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll come,â\\x80\\x9d interrupted the prince, hastily, â\\x80\\x9cand\\r\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ll give you my word of honour that I will sit the whole evening and\\r\\nnot say a word.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI believe thatâ\\x80\\x99s the best thing you can do. You said youâ\\x80\\x99d â\\x80\\x98plead\\r\\nsick-listâ\\x80\\x99 just now; where in the world do you get hold of such\\r\\nexpressions? Why do you talk to me like this? Are you trying to\\r\\nirritate me, or what?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cForgive me, itâ\\x80\\x99s a schoolboy expression. I wonâ\\x80\\x99t do it again. I know\\r\\nquite well, I see it, that you are anxious on my account (now, donâ\\x80\\x99t be\\r\\nangry), and it makes me very happy to see it. You wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t believe how\\r\\nfrightened I am of misbehaving somehow, and how glad I am of your\\r\\ninstructions. But all this panic is simply nonsense, you know, Aglaya!\\r\\nI give you my word it is; I am so pleased that you are such a child,\\r\\nsuch a dear good child. How _charming_ you can be if you like, Aglaya.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAglaya wanted to be angry, of course, but suddenly some quite\\r\\nunexpected feeling seized upon her heart, all in a moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd you wonâ\\x80\\x99t reproach me for all these rude words of mineâ\\x80\\x94some\\r\\ndayâ\\x80\\x94afterwards?â\\x80\\x9d she asked, of a sudden.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat an idea! Of course not. And what are you blushing for again? And\\r\\nthere comes that frown once more! Youâ\\x80\\x99ve taken to looking too gloomy\\r\\nsometimes, Aglaya, much more than you used to. I know why it is.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBe quiet, do be quiet!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, no, I had much better speak out. I have long wished to say it, and\\r\\n_have_ said it, but thatâ\\x80\\x99s not enough, for you didnâ\\x80\\x99t believe me.\\r\\nBetween us two there stands a being whoâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBe quiet, be quiet, be quiet, be quiet!â\\x80\\x9d Aglaya struck in, suddenly,\\r\\nseizing his hand in hers, and gazing at him almost in terror.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this moment she was called by someone. She broke loose from him with\\r\\nan air of relief and ran away.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince was in a fever all night. It was strange, but he had\\r\\nsuffered from fever for several nights in succession. On this\\r\\nparticular night, while in semi-delirium, he had an idea: what if on\\r\\nthe morrow he were to have a fit before everybody? The thought seemed\\r\\nto freeze his blood within him. All night he fancied himself in some\\r\\nextraordinary society of strange persons. The worst of it was that he\\r\\nwas talking nonsense; he knew that he ought not to speak at all, and\\r\\nyet he talked the whole time; he seemed to be trying to persuade them\\r\\nall to something. Evgenie and Hippolyte were among the guests, and\\r\\nappeared to be great friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe awoke towards nine oâ\\x80\\x99clock with a headache, full of confused ideas\\r\\nand strange impressions. For some reason or other he felt most anxious\\r\\nto see Rogojin, to see and talk to him, but what he wished to say he\\r\\ncould not tell. Next, he determined to go and see Hippolyte. His mind\\r\\nwas in a confused state, so much so that the incidents of the morning\\r\\nseemed to be imperfectly realized, though acutely felt.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of these incidents was a visit from Lebedeff. Lebedeff came rather\\r\\nearlyâ\\x80\\x94before tenâ\\x80\\x94but he was tipsy already. Though the prince was not in\\r\\nan observant condition, yet he could not avoid seeing that for at least\\r\\nthree daysâ\\x80\\x94ever since General Ivolgin had left the house Lebedeff had\\r\\nbeen behaving very badly. He looked untidy and dirty at all times of\\r\\nthe day, and it was said that he had begun to rage about in his own\\r\\nhouse, and that his temper was very bad. As soon as he arrived this\\r\\nmorning, he began to hold forth, beating his breast and apparently\\r\\nblaming himself for something.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99veâ\\x80\\x94Iâ\\x80\\x99ve had a reward for my meannessâ\\x80\\x94Iâ\\x80\\x99ve had a slap in the face,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nhe concluded, tragically.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA slap in the face? From whom? And so early in the morning?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEarly?â\\x80\\x9d said Lebedeff, sarcastically. â\\x80\\x9cTime counts for nothing, even\\r\\nin physical chastisement; but my slap in the face was not physical, it\\r\\nwas moral.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe suddenly took a seat, very unceremoniously, and began his story. It\\r\\nwas very disconnected; the prince frowned, and wished he could get\\r\\naway; but suddenly a few words struck him. He sat stiff with\\r\\nwonderâ\\x80\\x94Lebedeff said some extraordinary things.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first place he began about some letter; the name of Aglaya\\r\\nIvanovna came in. Then suddenly he broke off and began to accuse the\\r\\nprince of something; he was apparently offended with him. At first he\\r\\ndeclared that the prince had trusted him with his confidences as to â\\x80\\x9ca\\r\\ncertain personâ\\x80\\x9d (Nastasia Philipovna), but that of late his friendship\\r\\nhad been thrust back into his bosom, and his innocent question as to\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9capproaching family changesâ\\x80\\x9d had been curtly put aside, which Lebedeff\\r\\ndeclared, with tipsy tears, he could not bear; especially as he knew so\\r\\nmuch already both from Rogojin and Nastasia Philipovna and her friend,\\r\\nand from Varvara Ardalionovna, and even from Aglaya Ivanovna, through\\r\\nhis daughter Vera. â\\x80\\x9cAnd who told Lizabetha Prokofievna something in\\r\\nsecret, by letter? Who told her all about the movements of a certain\\r\\nperson called Nastasia Philipovna? Who was the anonymous person, eh?\\r\\nTell me!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSurely not you?â\\x80\\x9d cried the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cJust so,â\\x80\\x9d said Lebedeff, with dignity; â\\x80\\x9cand only this very morning I\\r\\nhave sent up a letter to the noble lady, stating that I have a matter\\r\\nof great importance to communicate. She received the letter; I know she\\r\\ngot it; and she received _me_, too.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHave you just seen Lizabetha Prokofievna?â\\x80\\x9d asked the prince, scarcely\\r\\nbelieving his ears.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I saw her, and got the said slap in the face as mentioned. She\\r\\nchucked the letter back to me unopened, and kicked me out of the house,\\r\\nmorally, not physically, although not far off it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat letter do you mean she returned unopened?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat! didnâ\\x80\\x99t I tell you? Ha, ha, ha! I thought I had. Why, I received\\r\\na letter, you know, to be handed overâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFrom whom? To whom?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it was difficult, if not impossible, to extract anything from\\r\\nLebedeff. All the prince could gather was, that the letter had been\\r\\nreceived very early, and had a request written on the outside that it\\r\\nmight be sent on to the address given.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cJust as before, sir, just as before! To a certain person, and from a\\r\\ncertain hand. The individualâ\\x80\\x99s name who wrote the letter is to be\\r\\nrepresented by the letter A.â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat? Impossible! To Nastasia Philipovna? Nonsense!â\\x80\\x9d cried the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was, I assure you, and if not to her then to Rogojin, which is the\\r\\nsame thing. Mr. Hippolyte has had letters, too, and all from the\\r\\nindividual whose name begins with an A.,â\\x80\\x9d smirked Lebedeff, with a\\r\\nhideous grin.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he kept jumping from subject to subject, and forgetting what he had\\r\\nbegun to talk about, the prince said nothing, but waited, to give him\\r\\ntime.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was all very vague. Who had taken the letters, if letters there\\r\\nwere? Probably Veraâ\\x80\\x94and how could Lebedeff have got them? In all\\r\\nprobability, he had managed to steal the present letter from Vera, and\\r\\nhad himself gone over to Lizabetha Prokofievna with some idea in his\\r\\nhead. So the prince concluded at last.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are mad!â\\x80\\x9d he cried, indignantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot quite, esteemed prince,â\\x80\\x9d replied Lebedeff, with some acerbity. â\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nconfess I thought of doing you the service of handing the letter over\\r\\nto yourself, but I decided that it would pay me better to deliver it up\\r\\nto the noble lady aforesaid, as I had informed her of everything\\r\\nhitherto by anonymous letters; so when I sent her up a note from\\r\\nmyself, with the letter, you know, in order to fix a meeting for eight\\r\\noâ\\x80\\x99clock this morning, I signed it â\\x80\\x98your secret correspondent.â\\x80\\x99 They let\\r\\nme in at onceâ\\x80\\x94very quicklyâ\\x80\\x94by the back door, and the noble lady\\r\\nreceived me.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell? Go on.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, well, when I saw her she almost punched my head, as I say; in fact\\r\\nso nearly that one might almost say she did punch my head. She threw\\r\\nthe letter in my face; she seemed to reflect first, as if she would\\r\\nhave liked to keep it, but thought better of it and threw it in my face\\r\\ninstead. â\\x80\\x98If anybody can have been such a fool as to trust a man like\\r\\nyou to deliver the letter,â\\x80\\x99 says she, â\\x80\\x98take it and deliver it!â\\x80\\x99 Hey!\\r\\nshe was grandly indignant. A fierce, fiery lady that, sir!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhereâ\\x80\\x99s the letter now?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve still got it, here!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he handed the prince the very letter from Aglaya to Gania, which\\r\\nthe latter showed with so much triumph to his sister at a later hour.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis letter cannot be allowed to remain in your hands.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s for youâ\\x80\\x94for you! Iâ\\x80\\x99ve brought it you on purpose!â\\x80\\x9d cried Lebedeff,\\r\\nexcitedly. â\\x80\\x9cWhy, Iâ\\x80\\x99m yours again now, heart and hand, your slave; there\\r\\nwas but a momentary pause in the flow of my love and esteem for you.\\r\\nMea culpa, mea culpa! as the Pope of Rome says.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis letter should be sent on at once,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, disturbed.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll hand it over myself.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWouldnâ\\x80\\x99t it be better, esteemed prince, wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t it be betterâ\\x80\\x94toâ\\x80\\x94donâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nyou knowâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLebedeff made a strange and very expressive grimace; he twisted about\\r\\nin his chair, and did something, apparently symbolical, with his hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean?â\\x80\\x9d said the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, open it, for the time being, donâ\\x80\\x99t you know?â\\x80\\x9d he said, most\\r\\nconfidentially and mysteriously.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince jumped up so furiously that Lebedeff ran towards the door;\\r\\nhaving gained which strategic position, however, he stopped and looked\\r\\nback to see if he might hope for pardon.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, Lebedeff, Lebedeff! Can a man really sink to such depths of\\r\\nmeanness?â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, sadly.\\r\\n\\r\\nLebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s face brightened.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, Iâ\\x80\\x99m a mean wretchâ\\x80\\x94a mean wretch!â\\x80\\x9d he said, approaching the prince\\r\\nonce more, and beating his breast, with tears in his eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s abominable dishonesty, you know!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDishonestyâ\\x80\\x94it is, it is! Thatâ\\x80\\x99s the very word!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat in the world induces you to act so? You are nothing but a spy.\\r\\nWhy did you write anonymously to worry so noble and generous a lady?\\r\\nWhy should not Aglaya Ivanovna write a note to whomever she pleases?\\r\\nWhat did you mean to complain of today? What did you expect to get by\\r\\nit? What made you go at all?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPure amiable curiosity,â\\x80\\x94I assure youâ\\x80\\x94desire to do a service. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nall. Now Iâ\\x80\\x99m entirely yours again, your slave; hang me if you like!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDid you go before Lizabetha Prokofievna in your present condition?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\ninquired the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNoâ\\x80\\x94oh no, fresherâ\\x80\\x94more the correct card. I only became this like after\\r\\nthe humiliation I suffered there.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWellâ\\x80\\x94thatâ\\x80\\x99ll do; now leave me.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis injunction had to be repeated several times before the man could\\r\\nbe persuaded to move. Even then he turned back at the door, came as far\\r\\nas the middle of the room, and there went through his mysterious\\r\\nmotions designed to convey the suggestion that the prince should open\\r\\nthe letter. He did not dare put his suggestion into words again.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter this performance, he smiled sweetly and left the room on tiptoe.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this had been very painful to listen to. One fact stood out certain\\r\\nand clear, and that was that poor Aglaya must be in a state of great\\r\\ndistress and indecision and mental torment (â\\x80\\x9cfrom jealousy,â\\x80\\x9d the prince\\r\\nwhispered to himself). Undoubtedly in this inexperienced, but hot and\\r\\nproud little head, there were all sorts of plans forming, wild and\\r\\nimpossible plans, maybe; and the idea of this so frightened the prince\\r\\nthat he could not make up his mind what to do. Something must be done,\\r\\nthat was clear.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked at the address on the letter once more. Oh, he was not in the\\r\\nleast degree alarmed about Aglaya writing such a letter; he could trust\\r\\nher. What he did not like about it was that he could not trust Gania.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, he made up his mind that he would himself take the note and\\r\\ndeliver it. Indeed, he went so far as to leave the house and walk up\\r\\nthe road, but changed his mind when he had nearly reached Ptitsinâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ndoor. However, he there luckily met Colia, and commissioned him to\\r\\ndeliver the letter to his brother as if direct from Aglaya. Colia asked\\r\\nno questions but simply delivered it, and Gania consequently had no\\r\\nsuspicion that it had passed through so many hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nArrived home again, the prince sent for Vera Lebedeff and told her as\\r\\nmuch as was necessary, in order to relieve her mind, for she had been\\r\\nin a dreadful state of anxiety since she had missed the letter. She\\r\\nheard with horror that her father had taken it. Muishkin learned from\\r\\nher that she had on several occasions performed secret missions both\\r\\nfor Aglaya and for Rogojin, without, however, having had the slightest\\r\\nidea that in so doing she might injure the prince in any way.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe latter, with one thing and another, was now so disturbed and\\r\\nconfused, that when, a couple of hours or so later, a message came from\\r\\nColia that the general was ill, he could hardly take the news in.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, when he did master the fact, it acted upon him as a tonic by\\r\\ncompletely distracting his attention. He went at once to Nina\\r\\nAlexandrovnaâ\\x80\\x99s, whither the general had been carried, and stayed there\\r\\nuntil the evening. He could do no good, but there are people whom to\\r\\nhave near one is a blessing at such times. Colia was in an almost\\r\\nhysterical state; he cried continuously, but was running about all day,\\r\\nall the same; fetching doctors, of whom he collected three; going to\\r\\nthe chemistâ\\x80\\x99s, and so on.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general was brought round to some extent, but the doctors declared\\r\\nthat he could not be said to be out of danger. Varia and Nina\\r\\nAlexandrovna never left the sick manâ\\x80\\x99s bedside; Gania was excited and\\r\\ndistressed, but would not go upstairs, and seemed afraid to look at the\\r\\npatient. He wrung his hands when the prince spoke to him, and said that\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9csuch a misfortune at such a momentâ\\x80\\x9d was terrible.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince thought he knew what Gania meant by â\\x80\\x9csuch a moment.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHippolyte was not in the house. Lebedeff turned up late in the\\r\\nafternoon; he had been asleep ever since his interview with the prince\\r\\nin the morning. He was quite sober now, and cried with real sincerity\\r\\nover the sick generalâ\\x80\\x94mourning for him as though he were his own\\r\\nbrother. He blamed himself aloud, but did not explain why. He repeated\\r\\nover and over again to Nina Alexandrovna that he alone was to blameâ\\x80\\x94no\\r\\none elseâ\\x80\\x94but that he had acted out of â\\x80\\x9cpure amiable curiosity,â\\x80\\x9d and\\r\\nthat â\\x80\\x9cthe deceased,â\\x80\\x9d as he insisted upon calling the still living\\r\\ngeneral, had been the greatest of geniuses.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe laid much stress on the genius of the sufferer, as if this idea must\\r\\nbe one of immense solace in the present crisis.\\r\\n\\r\\nNina Alexandrovnaâ\\x80\\x94seeing his sincerity of feelingâ\\x80\\x94said at last, and\\r\\nwithout the faintest suspicion of reproach in her voice: â\\x80\\x9cCome,\\r\\ncomeâ\\x80\\x94donâ\\x80\\x99t cry! God will forgive you!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLebedeff was so impressed by these words, and the tone in which they\\r\\nwere spoken, that he could not leave Nina Alexandrovna all the\\r\\neveningâ\\x80\\x94in fact, for several days. Till the generalâ\\x80\\x99s death, indeed, he\\r\\nspent almost all his time at his side.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwice during the day a messenger came to Nina Alexandrovna from the\\r\\nEpanchins to inquire after the invalid.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhenâ\\x80\\x94late in the eveningâ\\x80\\x94the prince made his appearance in Lizabetha\\r\\nProkofievnaâ\\x80\\x99s drawing-room, he found it full of guests. Mrs. Epanchin\\r\\nquestioned him very fully about the general as soon as he appeared; and\\r\\nwhen old Princess Bielokonski wished to know â\\x80\\x9cwho this general was, and\\r\\nwho was Nina Alexandrovna,â\\x80\\x9d she proceeded to explain in a manner which\\r\\npleased the prince very much.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe himself, when relating the circumstances of the generalâ\\x80\\x99s illness to\\r\\nLizabetha Prokofievna, â\\x80\\x9cspoke beautifully,â\\x80\\x9d as Aglayaâ\\x80\\x99s sisters\\r\\ndeclared afterwardsâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cmodestly, quietly, without gestures or too many\\r\\nwords, and with great dignity.â\\x80\\x9d He had entered the room with propriety\\r\\nand grace, and he was perfectly dressed; he not only did not â\\x80\\x9cfall down\\r\\non the slippery floor,â\\x80\\x9d as he had expressed it, but evidently made a\\r\\nvery favourable impression upon the assembled guests.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for his own impression on entering the room and taking his seat, he\\r\\ninstantly remarked that the company was not in the least such as\\r\\nAglayaâ\\x80\\x99s words had led him to fear, and as he had dreamed ofâ\\x80\\x94in\\r\\nnightmare formâ\\x80\\x94all night.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was the first time in his life that he had seen a little corner of\\r\\nwhat was generally known by the terrible name of â\\x80\\x9csociety.â\\x80\\x9d He had long\\r\\nthirsted, for reasons of his own, to penetrate the mysteries of the\\r\\nmagic circle, and, therefore, this assemblage was of the greatest\\r\\npossible interest to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis first impression was one of fascination. Somehow or other he felt\\r\\nthat all these people must have been born on purpose to be together! It\\r\\nseemed to him that the Epanchins were not having a party at all; that\\r\\nthese people must have been here always, and that he himself was one of\\r\\nthemâ\\x80\\x94returned among them after a long absence, but one of them,\\r\\nnaturally and indisputably.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt never struck him that all this refined simplicity and nobility and\\r\\nwit and personal dignity might possibly be no more than an exquisite\\r\\nartistic polish. The majority of the guestsâ\\x80\\x94who were somewhat\\r\\nempty-headed, after all, in spite of their aristocratic bearingâ\\x80\\x94never\\r\\nguessed, in their self-satisfied composure, that much of their\\r\\nsuperiority was mere veneer, which indeed they had adopted\\r\\nunconsciously and by inheritance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince would never so much as suspect such a thing in the delight\\r\\nof his first impression.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe saw, for instance, that one important dignitary, old enough to be\\r\\nhis grandfather, broke off his own conversation in order to listen to\\r\\n_him_â\\x80\\x94a young and inexperienced man; and not only listened, but seemed\\r\\nto attach value to his opinion, and was kind and amiable, and yet they\\r\\nwere strangers and had never seen each other before. Perhaps what most\\r\\nappealed to the princeâ\\x80\\x99s impressionability was the refinement of the\\r\\nold manâ\\x80\\x99s courtesy towards him. Perhaps the soil of his susceptible\\r\\nnature was really predisposed to receive a pleasant impression.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile all these peopleâ\\x80\\x94though friends of the family and of each\\r\\nother to a certain extentâ\\x80\\x94were very far from being such intimate\\r\\nfriends of the family and of each other as the prince concluded. There\\r\\nwere some present who never would think of considering the Epanchins\\r\\ntheir equals. There were even some who hated one another cordially. For\\r\\ninstance, old Princess Bielokonski had all her life despised the wife\\r\\nof the â\\x80\\x9cdignitary,â\\x80\\x9d while the latter was very far from loving Lizabetha\\r\\nProkofievna. The dignitary himself had been General Epanchinâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nprotector from his youth up; and the general considered him so majestic\\r\\na personage that he would have felt a hearty contempt for himself if he\\r\\nhad even for one moment allowed himself to pose as the great manâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nequal, or to think of himâ\\x80\\x94in his fear and reverenceâ\\x80\\x94as anything less\\r\\nthan an Olympic God! There were others present who had not met for\\r\\nyears, and who had no feeling whatever for each other, unless it were\\r\\ndislike; and yet they met tonight as though they had seen each other\\r\\nbut yesterday in some friendly and intimate assembly of kindred\\r\\nspirits.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not a large party, however. Besides Princess Bielokonski and the\\r\\nold dignitary (who was really a great man) and his wife, there was an\\r\\nold military generalâ\\x80\\x94a count or baron with a German name, a man reputed\\r\\nto possess great knowledge and administrative ability. He was one of\\r\\nthose Olympian administrators who know everything except Russia,\\r\\npronounce a word of extraordinary wisdom, admired by all, about once in\\r\\nfive years, and, after being an eternity in the service, generally die\\r\\nfull of honour and riches, though they have never done anything great,\\r\\nand have even been hostile to all greatness. This general was Ivan\\r\\nFedorovitchâ\\x80\\x99s immediate superior in the service; and it pleased the\\r\\nlatter to look upon him also as a patron. On the other hand, the great\\r\\nman did not at all consider himself Epanchinâ\\x80\\x99s patron. He was always\\r\\nvery cool to him, while taking advantage of his ready services, and\\r\\nwould instantly have put another in his place if there had been the\\r\\nslightest reason for the change.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother guest was an elderly, important-looking gentleman, a distant\\r\\nrelative of Lizabetha Prokofievnaâ\\x80\\x99s. This gentleman was rich, held a\\r\\ngood position, was a great talker, and had the reputation of being â\\x80\\x9cone\\r\\nof the dissatisfied,â\\x80\\x9d though not belonging to the dangerous sections of\\r\\nthat class. He had the manners, to some extent, of the English\\r\\naristocracy, and some of their tastes (especially in the matter of\\r\\nunder-done roast beef, harness, men-servants, etc.). He was a great\\r\\nfriend of the dignitaryâ\\x80\\x99s, and Lizabetha Prokofievna, for some reason\\r\\nor other, had got hold of the idea that this worthy intended at no\\r\\ndistant date to offer the advantages of his hand and heart to\\r\\nAlexandra.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides the elevated and more solid individuals enumerated, there were\\r\\npresent a few younger though not less elegant guests. Besides Prince S.\\r\\nand Evgenie Pavlovitch, we must name the eminent and fascinating Prince\\r\\nN.â\\x80\\x94once the vanquisher of female hearts all over Europe. This gentleman\\r\\nwas no longer in the first bloom of youthâ\\x80\\x94he was forty-five, but still\\r\\nvery handsome. He was well off, and lived, as a rule, abroad, and was\\r\\nnoted as a good teller of stories. Then came a few guests belonging to\\r\\na lower stratum of societyâ\\x80\\x94people who, like the Epanchins themselves,\\r\\nmoved only occasionally in this exalted sphere. The Epanchins liked to\\r\\ndraft among their more elevated guests a few picked representatives of\\r\\nthis lower stratum, and Lizabetha Prokofievna received much praise for\\r\\nthis practice, which proved, her friends said, that she was a woman of\\r\\ntact. The Epanchins prided themselves upon the good opinion people held\\r\\nof them.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the representatives of the middle-class present today was a\\r\\ncolonel of engineers, a very serious man and a great friend of Prince\\r\\nS., who had introduced him to the Epanchins. He was extremely silent in\\r\\nsociety, and displayed on the forefinger of his right hand a large\\r\\nring, probably bestowed upon him for services of some sort. There was\\r\\nalso a poet, German by name, but a Russian poet; very presentable, and\\r\\neven handsomeâ\\x80\\x94the sort of man one could bring into society with\\r\\nimpunity. This gentleman belonged to a German family of decidedly\\r\\nbourgeois origin, but he had a knack of acquiring the patronage of\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbig-wigs,â\\x80\\x9d and of retaining their favour. He had translated some great\\r\\nGerman poem into Russian verse, and claimed to have been a friend of a\\r\\nfamous Russian poet, since dead. (It is strange how great a multitude\\r\\nof literary people there are who have had the advantages of friendship\\r\\nwith some great man of their own profession who is, unfortunately,\\r\\ndead.) The dignitaryâ\\x80\\x99s wife had introduced this worthy to the\\r\\nEpanchins. This lady posed as the patroness of literary people, and she\\r\\ncertainly had succeeded in obtaining pensions for a few of them, thanks\\r\\nto her influence with those in authority on such matters. She was a\\r\\nlady of weight in her own way. Her age was about forty-five, so that\\r\\nshe was a very young wife for such an elderly husband as the dignitary.\\r\\nShe had been a beauty in her day and still loved, as many ladies of\\r\\nforty-five do love, to dress a little too smartly. Her intellect was\\r\\nnothing to boast of, and her literary knowledge very doubtful. Literary\\r\\npatronage was, however, with her as much a mania as was the love of\\r\\ngorgeous clothes. Many books and translations were dedicated to her by\\r\\nher proteges, and a few of these talented individuals had published\\r\\nsome of their own letters to her, upon very weighty subjects.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis, then, was the society that the prince accepted at once as true\\r\\ncoin, as pure gold without alloy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt so happened, however, that on this particular evening all these good\\r\\npeople were in excellent humour and highly pleased with themselves.\\r\\nEvery one of them felt that they were doing the Epanchins the greatest\\r\\npossible honour by their presence. But alas! the prince never suspected\\r\\nany such subtleties! For instance, he had no suspicion of the fact that\\r\\nthe Epanchins, having in their mind so important a step as the marriage\\r\\nof their daughter, would never think of presuming to take it without\\r\\nhaving previously â\\x80\\x9cshown offâ\\x80\\x9d the proposed husband to the dignitaryâ\\x80\\x94the\\r\\nrecognized patron of the family. The latter, too, though he would\\r\\nprobably have received news of a great disaster to the Epanchin family\\r\\nwith perfect composure, would nevertheless have considered it a\\r\\npersonal offence if they had dared to marry their daughter without his\\r\\nadvice, or we might almost say, his leave.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe amiable and undoubtedly witty Prince N. could not but feel that he\\r\\nwas as a sun, risen for one night only to shine upon the Epanchin\\r\\ndrawing-room. He accounted them immeasurably his inferiors, and it was\\r\\nthis feeling which caused his special amiability and delightful ease\\r\\nand grace towards them. He knew very well that he must tell some story\\r\\nthis evening for the edification of the company, and led up to it with\\r\\nthe inspiration of anticipatory triumph.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince, when he heard the story afterwards, felt that he had never\\r\\nyet come across so wonderful a humorist, or such remarkable brilliancy\\r\\nas was shown by this man; and yet if he had only known it, this story\\r\\nwas the oldest, stalest, and most worn-out yarn, and every drawing-room\\r\\nin town was sick to death of it. It was only in the innocent Epanchin\\r\\nhousehold that it passed for a new and brilliant taleâ\\x80\\x94as a sudden and\\r\\nstriking reminiscence of a splendid and talented man.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven the German poet, though as amiable as possible, felt that he was\\r\\ndoing the house the greatest of honours by his presence in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the prince only looked at the bright side; he did not turn the coat\\r\\nand see the shabby lining.\\r\\n\\r\\nAglaya had not foreseen that particular calamity. She herself looked\\r\\nwonderfully beautiful this evening. All three sisters were dressed very\\r\\ntastefully, and their hair was done with special care.\\r\\n\\r\\nAglaya sat next to Evgenie Pavlovitch, and laughed and talked to him\\r\\nwith an unusual display of friendliness. Evgenie himself behaved rather\\r\\nmore sedately than usual, probably out of respect to the dignitary.\\r\\nEvgenie had been known in society for a long while. He had appeared at\\r\\nthe Epanchinsâ\\x80\\x99 today with crape on his hat, and Princess Bielokonski\\r\\nhad commended this action on his part. Not every society man would have\\r\\nworn crape for â\\x80\\x9csuch an uncle.â\\x80\\x9d Lizabetha Prokofievna had liked it\\r\\nalso, but was too preoccupied to take much notice. The prince remarked\\r\\nthat Aglaya looked attentively at him two or three times, and seemed to\\r\\nbe satisfied with his behaviour.\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle by little he became very happy indeed. All his late anxieties\\r\\nand apprehensions (after his conversation with Lebedeff) now appeared\\r\\nlike so many bad dreamsâ\\x80\\x94impossible, and even laughable.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did not speak much, only answering such questions as were put to\\r\\nhim, and gradually settled down into unbroken silence, listening to\\r\\nwhat went on, and steeped in perfect satisfaction and contentment.\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle by little a sort of inspiration, however, began to stir within\\r\\nhim, ready to spring into life at the right moment. When he did begin\\r\\nto speak, it was accidentally, in response to a question, and\\r\\napparently without any special object.\\r\\n\\r\\nVII.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile he feasted his eyes upon Aglaya, as she talked merrily with\\r\\nEvgenie and Prince N., suddenly the old anglomaniac, who was talking to\\r\\nthe dignitary in another corner of the room, apparently telling him a\\r\\nstory about something or otherâ\\x80\\x94suddenly this gentleman pronounced the\\r\\nname of â\\x80\\x9cNicolai Andreevitch Pavlicheffâ\\x80\\x9d aloud. The prince quickly\\r\\nturned towards him, and listened.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conversation had been on the subject of land, and the present\\r\\ndisorders, and there must have been something amusing said, for the old\\r\\nman had begun to laugh at his companionâ\\x80\\x99s heated expressions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe latter was describing in eloquent words how, in consequence of\\r\\nrecent legislation, he was obliged to sell a beautiful estate in the N.\\r\\nprovince, not because he wanted ready moneyâ\\x80\\x94in fact, he was obliged to\\r\\nsell it at half its value. â\\x80\\x9cTo avoid another lawsuit about the\\r\\nPavlicheff estate, I ran away,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cWith a few more inheritances\\r\\nof that kind I should soon be ruined!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this point General Epanchin, noticing how interested Muishkin had\\r\\nbecome in the conversation, said to him, in a low tone:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat gentlemanâ\\x80\\x94Ivan Petrovitchâ\\x80\\x94is a relation of your late friend, Mr.\\r\\nPavlicheff. You wanted to find some of his relations, did you not?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general, who had been talking to his chief up to this moment, had\\r\\nobserved the princeâ\\x80\\x99s solitude and silence, and was anxious to draw him\\r\\ninto the conversation, and so introduce him again to the notice of some\\r\\nof the important personages.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLef Nicolaievitch was a ward of Nicolai Andreevitch Pavlicheff, after\\r\\nthe death of his own parents,â\\x80\\x9d he remarked, meeting Ivan Petrovitchâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\neye.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery happy to meet him, Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure,â\\x80\\x9d remarked the latter. â\\x80\\x9cI remember\\r\\nLef Nicolaievitch well. When General Epanchin introduced us just now, I\\r\\nrecognized you at once, prince. You are very little changed, though I\\r\\nsaw you last as a child of some ten or eleven years old. There was\\r\\nsomething in your features, I suppose, thatâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou saw me as a child!â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed the prince, with surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh! yes, long ago,â\\x80\\x9d continued Ivan Petrovitch, â\\x80\\x9cwhile you were living\\r\\nwith my cousin at Zlatoverhoff. You donâ\\x80\\x99t remember me? No, I dare say\\r\\nyou donâ\\x80\\x99t; you had some malady at the time, I remember. It was so\\r\\nserious that I was surprisedâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo; I remember nothing!â\\x80\\x9d said the prince. A few more words of\\r\\nexplanation followed, words which were spoken without the smallest\\r\\nexcitement by his companion, but which evoked the greatest agitation in\\r\\nthe prince; and it was discovered that two old ladies to whose care the\\r\\nprince had been left by Pavlicheff, and who lived at Zlatoverhoff, were\\r\\nalso relations of Ivan Petrovitch.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe latter had no idea and could give no information as to why\\r\\nPavlicheff had taken so great an interest in the little prince, his\\r\\nward.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn point of fact I donâ\\x80\\x99t think I thought much about it,â\\x80\\x9d said the old\\r\\nfellow. He seemed to have a wonderfully good memory, however, for he\\r\\ntold the prince all about the two old ladies, Pavlicheffâ\\x80\\x99s cousins, who\\r\\nhad taken care of him, and whom, he declared, he had taken to task for\\r\\nbeing too severe with the prince as a small sickly boyâ\\x80\\x94the elder\\r\\nsister, at least; the younger had been kind, he recollected. They both\\r\\nnow lived in another province, on a small estate left to them by\\r\\nPavlicheff. The prince listened to all this with eyes sparkling with\\r\\nemotion and delight.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe declared with unusual warmth that he would never forgive himself for\\r\\nhaving travelled about in the central provinces during these last six\\r\\nmonths without having hunted up his two old friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe declared, further, that he had intended to go every day, but had\\r\\nalways been prevented by circumstances; but that now he would promise\\r\\nhimself the pleasureâ\\x80\\x94however far it was, he would find them out. And so\\r\\nIvan Petrovitch _really_ knew Natalia Nikitishna!â\\x80\\x94what a saintly nature\\r\\nwas hers!â\\x80\\x94and Martha Nikitishna! Ivan Petrovitch must excuse him, but\\r\\nreally he was not quite fair on dear old Martha. She was severe,\\r\\nperhaps; but then what else could she be with such a little idiot as he\\r\\nwas then? (Ha, ha.) He really was an idiot then, Ivan Petrovitch must\\r\\nknow, though he might not believe it. (Ha, ha.) So he had really seen\\r\\nhim there! Good heavens! And was he really and truly and actually a\\r\\ncousin of Pavlicheffâ\\x80\\x99s?\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI assure you of it,â\\x80\\x9d laughed Ivan Petrovitch, gazing amusedly at the\\r\\nprince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh! I didnâ\\x80\\x99t say it because I _doubt_ the fact, you know. (Ha, ha.)\\r\\nHow could I doubt such a thing? (Ha, ha, ha.) I made the remark\\r\\nbecauseâ\\x80\\x94because Nicolai Andreevitch Pavlicheff was such a splendid man,\\r\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t you see! Such a high-souled man, he really was, I assure you.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince did not exactly pant for breath, but he â\\x80\\x9cseemed almost to\\r\\n_choke_ out of pure simplicity and goodness of heart,â\\x80\\x9d as Adelaida\\r\\nexpressed it, on talking the party over with her fiance, the Prince S.,\\r\\nnext morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut, my goodness me,â\\x80\\x9d laughed Ivan Petrovitch, â\\x80\\x9cwhy canâ\\x80\\x99t I be cousin\\r\\nto even a splendid man?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, dear!â\\x80\\x9d cried the prince, confused, trying to hurry his words out,\\r\\nand growing more and more eager every moment: â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve gone and said\\r\\nanother stupid thing. I donâ\\x80\\x99t know what to say. Iâ\\x80\\x94I didnâ\\x80\\x99t mean that,\\r\\nyou knowâ\\x80\\x94Iâ\\x80\\x94Iâ\\x80\\x94he really was such a splendid man, wasnâ\\x80\\x99t he?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince trembled all over. Why was he so agitated? Why had he flown\\r\\ninto such transports of delight without any apparent reason? He had far\\r\\noutshot the measure of joy and emotion consistent with the occasion.\\r\\nWhy this was it would be difficult to say.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe seemed to feel warmly and deeply grateful to someone for something\\r\\nor otherâ\\x80\\x94perhaps to Ivan Petrovitch; but likely enough to all the\\r\\nguests, individually, and collectively. He was much too happy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIvan Petrovitch began to stare at him with some surprise; the\\r\\ndignitary, too, looked at him with considerable attention; Princess\\r\\nBielokonski glared at him angrily, and compressed her lips. Prince N.,\\r\\nEvgenie, Prince S., and the girls, all broke off their own\\r\\nconversations and listened. Aglaya seemed a little startled; as for\\r\\nLizabetha Prokofievna, her heart sank within her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was odd of Lizabetha Prokofievna and her daughters. They had\\r\\nthemselves decided that it would be better if the prince did not talk\\r\\nall the evening. Yet seeing him sitting silent and alone, but perfectly\\r\\nhappy, they had been on the point of exerting themselves to draw him\\r\\ninto one of the groups of talkers around the room. Now that he was in\\r\\nthe midst of a talk they became more than ever anxious and perturbed.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat he was a splendid man is perfectly true; you are quite right,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nrepeated Ivan Petrovitch, but seriously this time. â\\x80\\x9cHe was a fine and a\\r\\nworthy fellowâ\\x80\\x94worthy, one may say, of the highest respect,â\\x80\\x9d he added,\\r\\nmore and more seriously at each pause; â\\x80\\x9cand it is agreeable to see, on\\r\\nyour part, suchâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWasnâ\\x80\\x99t it this same Pavlicheff about whom there was a strange story in\\r\\nconnection with some abbot? I donâ\\x80\\x99t remember who the abbot was, but I\\r\\nremember at one time everybody was talking about it,â\\x80\\x9d remarked the old\\r\\ndignitary.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYesâ\\x80\\x94Abbot Gurot, a Jesuit,â\\x80\\x9d said Ivan Petrovitch. â\\x80\\x9cYes, thatâ\\x80\\x99s the\\r\\nsort of thing our best men are apt to do. A man of rank, too, and\\r\\nrichâ\\x80\\x94a man who, if he had continued to serve, might have done anything;\\r\\nand then to throw up the service and everything else in order to go\\r\\nover to Roman Catholicism and turn Jesuitâ\\x80\\x94openly, tooâ\\x80\\x94almost\\r\\ntriumphantly. By Jove! it was positively a mercy that he died when he\\r\\ndidâ\\x80\\x94it was indeedâ\\x80\\x94everyone said so at the time.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince was beside himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPavlicheff?â\\x80\\x94Pavlicheff turned Roman Catholic? Impossible!â\\x80\\x9d he cried,\\r\\nin horror.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHâ\\x80\\x99m! impossible is rather a strong word,â\\x80\\x9d said Ivan Petrovitch. â\\x80\\x9cYou\\r\\nmust allow, my dear prince... However, of course you value the memory\\r\\nof the deceased so very highly; and he certainly was the kindest of\\r\\nmen; to which fact, by the way, I ascribe, more than to anything else,\\r\\nthe success of the abbot in influencing his religious convictions. But\\r\\nyou may ask me, if you please, how much trouble and worry I,\\r\\npersonally, had over that business, and especially with this same\\r\\nGurot! Would you believe it,â\\x80\\x9d he continued, addressing the dignitary,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthey actually tried to put in a claim under the deceasedâ\\x80\\x99s will, and I\\r\\nhad to resort to the very strongest measures in order to bring them to\\r\\ntheir senses? I assure you they knew their cue, did these\\r\\ngentlemenâ\\x80\\x94wonderful! Thank goodness all this was in Moscow, and I got\\r\\nthe Court, you know, to help me, and we soon brought them to their\\r\\nsenses.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t believe how you have pained and astonished me,â\\x80\\x9d cried the\\r\\nprince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery sorry; but in point of fact, you know, it was all nonsense and\\r\\nwould have ended in smoke, as usualâ\\x80\\x94Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure of that. Last year,â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94he\\r\\nturned to the old man again,â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cCountess K. joined some Roman Convent\\r\\nabroad. Our people never seem to be able to offer any resistance so\\r\\nsoon as they get into the hands of theseâ\\x80\\x94intriguersâ\\x80\\x94especially abroad.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is all thanks to our lassitude, I think,â\\x80\\x9d replied the old man,\\r\\nwith authority. â\\x80\\x9cAnd then their way of preaching; they have a skilful\\r\\nmanner of doing it! And they know how to startle one, too. I got quite\\r\\na fright myself in â\\x80\\x9932, in Vienna, I assure you; but I didnâ\\x80\\x99t cave in\\r\\nto them, I ran away instead, ha, ha!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome, come, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve always heard that you ran away with the beautiful\\r\\nCountess Levitsky that timeâ\\x80\\x94throwing up everything in order to do\\r\\nitâ\\x80\\x94and not from the Jesuits at all,â\\x80\\x9d said Princess Bielokonski,\\r\\nsuddenly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, yesâ\\x80\\x94but we call it from the Jesuits, you know; it comes to the\\r\\nsame thing,â\\x80\\x9d laughed the old fellow, delighted with the pleasant\\r\\nrecollection.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou seem to be very religious,â\\x80\\x9d he continued, kindly, addressing the\\r\\nprince, â\\x80\\x9cwhich is a thing one meets so seldom nowadays among young\\r\\npeople.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince was listening open-mouthed, and still in a condition of\\r\\nexcited agitation. The old man was evidently interested in him, and\\r\\nanxious to study him more closely.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPavlicheff was a man of bright intellect and a good Christian, a\\r\\nsincere Christian,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, suddenly. â\\x80\\x9cHow could he possibly\\r\\nembrace a faith which is unchristian? Roman Catholicism is, so to\\r\\nspeak, simply the same thing as unchristianity,â\\x80\\x9d he added with flashing\\r\\neyes, which seemed to take in everybody in the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome, thatâ\\x80\\x99s a little _too_ strong, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it?â\\x80\\x9d murmured the old man,\\r\\nglancing at General Epanchin in surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow do you make out that the Roman Catholic religion is _unchristian?_\\r\\nWhat is it, then?â\\x80\\x9d asked Ivan Petrovitch, turning to the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is not a Christian religion, in the first place,â\\x80\\x9d said the latter,\\r\\nin extreme agitation, quite out of proportion to the necessity of the\\r\\nmoment. â\\x80\\x9cAnd in the second place, Roman Catholicism is, in my opinion,\\r\\nworse than Atheism itself. Yesâ\\x80\\x94that is my opinion. Atheism only\\r\\npreaches a negation, but Romanism goes further; it preaches a\\r\\ndisfigured, distorted Christâ\\x80\\x94it preaches Anti-Christâ\\x80\\x94I assure you, I\\r\\nswear it! This is my own personal conviction, and it has long\\r\\ndistressed me. The Roman Catholic believes that the Church on earth\\r\\ncannot stand without universal temporal Power. He cries â\\x80\\x98non possumus!â\\x80\\x99\\r\\nIn my opinion the Roman Catholic religion is not a faith at all, but\\r\\nsimply a continuation of the Roman Empire, and everything is\\r\\nsubordinated to this ideaâ\\x80\\x94beginning with faith. The Pope has seized\\r\\nterritories and an earthly throne, and has held them with the sword.\\r\\nAnd so the thing has gone on, only that to the sword they have added\\r\\nlying, intrigue, deceit, fanaticism, superstition, swindling;â\\x80\\x94they have\\r\\nplayed fast and loose with the most sacred and sincere feelings of\\r\\nmen;â\\x80\\x94they have exchanged everythingâ\\x80\\x94everything for money, for base\\r\\nearthly _power!_ And is this not the teaching of Anti-Christ? How could\\r\\nthe upshot of all this be other than Atheism? Atheism is the child of\\r\\nRoman Catholicismâ\\x80\\x94it proceeded from these Romans themselves, though\\r\\nperhaps they would not believe it. It grew and fattened on hatred of\\r\\nits parents; it is the progeny of their lies and spiritual feebleness.\\r\\nAtheism! In our country it is only among the upper classes that you\\r\\nfind unbelievers; men who have lost the root or spirit of their faith;\\r\\nbut abroad whole masses of the people are beginning to profess\\r\\nunbeliefâ\\x80\\x94at first because of the darkness and lies by which they were\\r\\nsurrounded; but now out of fanaticism, out of loathing for the Church\\r\\nand Christianity!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince paused to get breath. He had spoken with extraordinary\\r\\nrapidity, and was very pale.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll present interchanged glances, but at last the old dignitary burst\\r\\nout laughing frankly. Prince N. took out his eye-glass to have a good\\r\\nlook at the speaker. The German poet came out of his corner and crept\\r\\nnearer to the table, with a spiteful smile.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou exaggerate the matter very much,â\\x80\\x9d said Ivan Petrovitch, with\\r\\nrather a bored air. â\\x80\\x9cThere are, in the foreign Churches, many\\r\\nrepresentatives of their faith who are worthy of respect and esteem.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, but I did not speak of individual representatives. I was merely\\r\\ntalking about Roman Catholicism, and its essenceâ\\x80\\x94of Rome itself. A\\r\\nChurch can never entirely disappear; I never hinted at that!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAgreed that all this may be true; but we need not discuss a subject\\r\\nwhich belongs to the domain of theology.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, no; oh, no! Not to theology alone, I assure you! Why, Socialism is\\r\\nthe progeny of Romanism and of the Romanistic spirit. It and its\\r\\nbrother Atheism proceed from Despair in opposition to Catholicism. It\\r\\nseeks to replace in itself the moral power of religion, in order to\\r\\nappease the spiritual thirst of parched humanity and save it; not by\\r\\nChrist, but by force. â\\x80\\x98Donâ\\x80\\x99t dare to believe in God, donâ\\x80\\x99t dare to\\r\\npossess any individuality, any property! _FraternitÃ© ou la Mort_; two\\r\\nmillion heads. â\\x80\\x98By their works ye shall know themâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x94we are told. And we\\r\\nmust not suppose that all this is harmless and without danger to\\r\\nourselves. Oh, no; we must resist, and quickly, quickly! We must let\\r\\nour Christ shine forth upon the Western nations, our Christ whom we\\r\\nhave preserved intact, and whom they have never known. Not as slaves,\\r\\nallowing ourselves to be caught by the hooks of the Jesuits, but\\r\\ncarrying our Russian civilization to _them_, we must stand before them,\\r\\nnot letting it be said among us that their preaching is â\\x80\\x98skilful,â\\x80\\x99 as\\r\\nsomeone expressed it just now.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut excuse me, excuse me;â\\x80\\x9d cried Ivan Petrovitch considerably\\r\\ndisturbed, and looking around uneasily. â\\x80\\x9cYour ideas are, of course,\\r\\nmost praiseworthy, and in the highest degree patriotic; but you\\r\\nexaggerate the matter terribly. It would be better if we dropped the\\r\\nsubject.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, sir, I do not exaggerate, I understate the matter, if anything,\\r\\nundoubtedly understate it; simply because I cannot express myself as I\\r\\nshould like, butâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAllow me!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince was silent. He sat straight up in his chair and gazed\\r\\nfervently at Ivan Petrovitch.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt seems to me that you have been too painfully impressed by the news\\r\\nof what happened to your good benefactor,â\\x80\\x9d said the old dignitary,\\r\\nkindly, and with the utmost calmness of demeanour. â\\x80\\x9cYou are excitable,\\r\\nperhaps as the result of your solitary life. If you would make up your\\r\\nmind to live more among your fellows in society, I trust, I am sure,\\r\\nthat the world would be glad to welcome you, as a remarkable young man;\\r\\nand you would soon find yourself able to look at things more calmly.\\r\\nYou would see that all these things are much simpler than you think;\\r\\nand, besides, these rare cases come about, in my opinion, from ennui\\r\\nand from satiety.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExactly, exactly! That is a true thought!â\\x80\\x9d cried the prince. â\\x80\\x9cFrom\\r\\nennui, from our ennui but not from satiety! Oh, no, you are wrong\\r\\nthere! Say from _thirst_ if you like; the thirst of fever! And please\\r\\ndo not suppose that this is so small a matter that we may have a laugh\\r\\nat it and dismiss it; we must be able to foresee our disasters and arm\\r\\nagainst them. We Russians no sooner arrive at the brink of the water,\\r\\nand realize that we are really at the brink, than we are so delighted\\r\\nwith the outlook that in we plunge and swim to the farthest point we\\r\\ncan see. Why is this? You say you are surprised at Pavlicheffâ\\x80\\x99s action;\\r\\nyou ascribe it to madness, to kindness of heart, and what not, but it\\r\\nis not so.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOur Russian intensity not only astonishes ourselves; all Europe\\r\\nwonders at our conduct in such cases! For, if one of us goes over to\\r\\nRoman Catholicism, he is sure to become a Jesuit at once, and a rabid\\r\\none into the bargain. If one of us becomes an Atheist, he must needs\\r\\nbegin to insist on the prohibition of faith in God by force, that is,\\r\\nby the sword. Why is this? Why does he then exceed all bounds at once?\\r\\nBecause he has found land at last, the fatherland that he sought in\\r\\nvain before; and, because his soul is rejoiced to find it, he throws\\r\\nhimself upon it and kisses it! Oh, it is not from vanity alone, it is\\r\\nnot from feelings of vanity that Russians become Atheists and Jesuits!\\r\\nBut from spiritual thirst, from anguish of longing for higher things,\\r\\nfor dry firm land, for foothold on a fatherland which they never\\r\\nbelieved in because they never knew it. It is easier for a Russian to\\r\\nbecome an Atheist, than for any other nationality in the world. And not\\r\\nonly does a Russian â\\x80\\x98become an Atheist,â\\x80\\x99 but he actually _believes in_\\r\\nAtheism, just as though he had found a new faith, not perceiving that\\r\\nhe has pinned his faith to a negation. Such is our anguish of thirst!\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Whoso has no country has no God.â\\x80\\x99 That is not my own expression; it is\\r\\nthe expression of a merchant, one of the Old Believers, whom I once met\\r\\nwhile travelling. He did not say exactly these words. I think his\\r\\nexpression was:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Whoso forsakes his country forsakes his God.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut let these thirsty Russian souls find, like Columbusâ\\x80\\x99 discoverers,\\r\\na new world; let them find the Russian world, let them search and\\r\\ndiscover all the gold and treasure that lies hid in the bosom of their\\r\\nown land! Show them the restitution of lost humanity, in the future, by\\r\\nRussian thought alone, and by means of the God and of the Christ of our\\r\\nRussian faith, and you will see how mighty and just and wise and good a\\r\\ngiant will rise up before the eyes of the astonished and frightened\\r\\nworld; astonished because they expect nothing but the sword from us,\\r\\nbecause they think they will get nothing out of us but barbarism. This\\r\\nhas been the case up to now, and the longer matters go on as they are\\r\\nnow proceeding, the more clear will be the truth of what I say; and Iâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut at this moment something happened which put a most unexpected end\\r\\nto the oratorâ\\x80\\x99s speech. All this heated tirade, this outflow of\\r\\npassionate words and ecstatic ideas which seemed to hustle and tumble\\r\\nover each other as they fell from his lips, bore evidence of some\\r\\nunusually disturbed mental condition in the young fellow who had\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cboiled overâ\\x80\\x9d in such a remarkable manner, without any apparent reason.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf those who were present, such as knew the prince listened to his\\r\\noutburst in a state of alarm, some with a feeling of mortification. It\\r\\nwas so unlike his usual timid self-constraint; so inconsistent with his\\r\\nusual taste and tact, and with his instinctive feeling for the higher\\r\\nproprieties. They could not understand the origin of the outburst; it\\r\\ncould not be simply the news of Pavlicheffâ\\x80\\x99s perversion. By the ladies\\r\\nthe prince was regarded as little better than a lunatic, and Princess\\r\\nBielokonski admitted afterwards that â\\x80\\x9cin another minute she would have\\r\\nbolted.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two old gentlemen looked quite alarmed. The old general (Epanchinâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nchief) sat and glared at the prince in severe displeasure. The colonel\\r\\nsat immovable. Even the German poet grew a little pale, though he wore\\r\\nhis usual artificial smile as he looked around to see what the others\\r\\nwould do.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn point of fact it is quite possible that the matter would have ended\\r\\nin a very commonplace and natural way in a few minutes. The undoubtedly\\r\\nastonished, but now more collected, General Epanchin had several times\\r\\nendeavoured to interrupt the prince, and not having succeeded he was\\r\\nnow preparing to take firmer and more vigorous measures to attain his\\r\\nend. In another minute or two he would probably have made up his mind\\r\\nto lead the prince quietly out of the room, on the plea of his being\\r\\nill (and it was more than likely that the general was right in his\\r\\nbelief that the prince _was_ actually ill), but it so happened that\\r\\ndestiny had something different in store.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the beginning of the evening, when the prince first came into the\\r\\nroom, he had sat down as far as possible from the Chinese vase which\\r\\nAglaya had spoken of the day before.\\r\\n\\r\\nWill it be believed that, after Aglayaâ\\x80\\x99s alarming words, an\\r\\nineradicable conviction had taken possession of his mind that, however\\r\\nhe might try to avoid this vase next day, he must certainly break it?\\r\\nBut so it was.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the evening other impressions began to awaken in his mind, as we\\r\\nhave seen, and he forgot his presentiment. But when Pavlicheff was\\r\\nmentioned and the general introduced him to Ivan Petrovitch, he had\\r\\nchanged his place, and went over nearer to the table; when, it so\\r\\nhappened, he took the chair nearest to the beautiful vase, which stood\\r\\non a pedestal behind him, just about on a level with his elbow.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke his last words he had risen suddenly from his seat with a\\r\\nwave of his arm, and there was a general cry of horror.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe huge vase swayed backwards and forwards; it seemed to be uncertain\\r\\nwhether or no to topple over on to the head of one of the old men, but\\r\\neventually determined to go the other way, and came crashing over\\r\\ntowards the German poet, who darted out of the way in terror.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crash, the cry, the sight of the fragments of valuable china\\r\\ncovering the carpet, the alarm of the companyâ\\x80\\x94what all this meant to\\r\\nthe poor prince it would be difficult to convey to the mind of the\\r\\nreader, or for him to imagine.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut one very curious fact was that all the shame and vexation and\\r\\nmortification which he felt over the accident were less powerful than\\r\\nthe deep impression of the almost supernatural truth of his\\r\\npremonition. He stood still in alarmâ\\x80\\x94in almost superstitious alarm, for\\r\\na moment; then all mists seemed to clear away from his eyes; he was\\r\\nconscious of nothing but light and joy and ecstasy; his breath came and\\r\\nwent; but the moment passed. Thank God it was not that! He drew a long\\r\\nbreath and looked around.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some minutes he did not seem to comprehend the excitement around\\r\\nhim; that is, he comprehended it and saw everything, but he stood\\r\\naside, as it were, like someone invisible in a fairy tale, as though he\\r\\nhad nothing to do with what was going on, though it pleased him to take\\r\\nan interest in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe saw them gather up the broken bits of china; he heard the loud\\r\\ntalking of the guests and observed how pale Aglaya looked, and how very\\r\\nstrangely she was gazing at him. There was no hatred in her expression,\\r\\nand no anger whatever. It was full of alarm for him, and sympathy and\\r\\naffection, while she looked around at the others with flashing, angry\\r\\neyes. His heart filled with a sweet pain as he gazed at her.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length he observed, to his amazement, that all had taken their seats\\r\\nagain, and were laughing and talking as though nothing had happened.\\r\\nAnother minute and the laughter grew louderâ\\x80\\x94they were laughing at him,\\r\\nat his dumb stuporâ\\x80\\x94laughing kindly and merrily. Several of them spoke\\r\\nto him, and spoke so kindly and cordially, especially Lizabetha\\r\\nProkofievnaâ\\x80\\x94she was saying the kindest possible things to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly he became aware that General Epanchin was tapping him on the\\r\\nshoulder; Ivan Petrovitch was laughing too, but still more kind and\\r\\nsympathizing was the old dignitary. He took the prince by the hand and\\r\\npressed it warmly; then he patted it, and quietly urged him to\\r\\nrecollect himselfâ\\x80\\x94speaking to him exactly as he would have spoken to a\\r\\nlittle frightened child, which pleased the prince wonderfully; and next\\r\\nseated him beside himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince gazed into his face with pleasure, but still seemed to have\\r\\nno power to speak. His breath failed him. The old manâ\\x80\\x99s face pleased\\r\\nhim greatly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you really forgive me?â\\x80\\x9d he said at last. â\\x80\\x9cAndâ\\x80\\x94and Lizabetha\\r\\nProkofievna too?â\\x80\\x9d The laugh increased, tears came into the princeâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\neyes, he could not believe in all this kindnessâ\\x80\\x94he was enchanted.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe vase certainly was a very beautiful one. I remember it here for\\r\\nfifteen yearsâ\\x80\\x94yes, quite that!â\\x80\\x9d remarked Ivan Petrovitch.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, what a dreadful calamity! A wretched vase smashed, and a man half\\r\\ndead with remorse about it,â\\x80\\x9d said Lizabetha Prokofievna, loudly. â\\x80\\x9cWhat\\r\\nmade you so dreadfully startled, Lef Nicolaievitch?â\\x80\\x9d she added, a\\r\\nlittle timidly. â\\x80\\x9cCome, my dear boy! cheer up. You really alarm me,\\r\\ntaking the accident so to heart.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you forgive me allâ\\x80\\x94_all_, besides the vase, I mean?â\\x80\\x9d said the\\r\\nprince, rising from his seat once more, but the old gentleman caught\\r\\nhis hand and drew him down againâ\\x80\\x94he seemed unwilling to let him go.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Câ\\x80\\x99est trÃ¨s-curieux et câ\\x80\\x99est trÃ¨s-sÃ©rieux_,â\\x80\\x9d he whispered across the\\r\\ntable to Ivan Petrovitch, rather loudly. Probably the prince heard him.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo that I have not offended any of you? You will not believe how happy\\r\\nI am to be able to think so. It is as it should be. As if I _could_\\r\\noffend anyone here! I should offend you again by even suggesting such a\\r\\nthing.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCalm yourself, my dear fellow. You are exaggerating again; you really\\r\\nhave no occasion to be so grateful to us. It is a feeling which does\\r\\nyou great credit, but an exaggeration, for all that.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am not exactly thanking you, I am only feeling a growing admiration\\r\\nfor youâ\\x80\\x94it makes me happy to look at you. I dare say I am speaking very\\r\\nfoolishly, but I must speakâ\\x80\\x94I must explain, if it be out of nothing\\r\\nbetter than self-respect.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAll he said and did was abrupt, confused, feverishâ\\x80\\x94very likely the\\r\\nwords he spoke, as often as not, were not those he wished to say. He\\r\\nseemed to inquire whether he _might_ speak. His eyes lighted on\\r\\nPrincess Bielokonski.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAll right, my friend, talk away, talk away!â\\x80\\x9d she remarked. â\\x80\\x9cOnly donâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nlose your breath; you were in such a hurry when you began, and look\\r\\nwhat youâ\\x80\\x99ve come to now! Donâ\\x80\\x99t be afraid of speakingâ\\x80\\x94all these ladies\\r\\nand gentlemen have seen far stranger people than yourself; you donâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nastonish _them_. You are nothing out-of-the-way remarkable, you know.\\r\\nYouâ\\x80\\x99ve done nothing but break a vase, and give us all a fright.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince listened, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWasnâ\\x80\\x99t it you,â\\x80\\x9d he said, suddenly turning to the old gentleman, â\\x80\\x9cwho\\r\\nsaved the student Porkunoff and a clerk called Shoabrin from being sent\\r\\nto Siberia, two or three months since?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old dignitary blushed a little, and murmured that the prince had\\r\\nbetter not excite himself further.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd I have heard of _you_,â\\x80\\x9d continued the prince, addressing Ivan\\r\\nPetrovitch, â\\x80\\x9cthat when some of your villagers were burned out you gave\\r\\nthem wood to build up their houses again, though they were no longer\\r\\nyour serfs and had behaved badly towards you.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, come, come! You are exaggerating,â\\x80\\x9d said Ivan Petrovitch, beaming\\r\\nwith satisfaction, all the same. He was right, however, in this\\r\\ninstance, for the report had reached the princeâ\\x80\\x99s ears in an incorrect\\r\\nform.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd you, princess,â\\x80\\x9d he went on, addressing Princess Bielokonski, â\\x80\\x9cwas\\r\\nit not you who received me in Moscow, six months since, as kindly as\\r\\nthough I had been your own son, in response to a letter from Lizabetha\\r\\nProkofievna; and gave me one piece of advice, again as to your own son,\\r\\nwhich I shall never forget? Do you remember?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat are you making such a fuss about?â\\x80\\x9d said the old lady, with\\r\\nannoyance. â\\x80\\x9cYou are a good fellow, but very silly. One gives you a\\r\\nhalfpenny, and you are as grateful as though one had saved your life.\\r\\nYou think this is praiseworthy on your part, but it is notâ\\x80\\x94it is not,\\r\\nindeed.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe seemed to be very angry, but suddenly burst out laughing, quite\\r\\ngood-humouredly.\\r\\n\\r\\nLizabetha Prokofievnaâ\\x80\\x99s face brightened up, too; so did that of General\\r\\nEpanchin.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI told you Lef Nicolaievitch was a manâ\\x80\\x94a manâ\\x80\\x94if only he would not be\\r\\nin such a hurry, as the princess remarked,â\\x80\\x9d said the latter, with\\r\\ndelight.\\r\\n\\r\\nAglaya alone seemed sad and depressed; her face was flushed, perhaps\\r\\nwith indignation.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe really is very charming,â\\x80\\x9d whispered the old dignitary to Ivan\\r\\nPetrovitch.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI came into this room with anguish in my heart,â\\x80\\x9d continued the prince,\\r\\nwith ever-growing agitation, speaking quicker and quicker, and with\\r\\nincreasing strangeness. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x94I was afraid of you all, and afraid of\\r\\nmyself. I was most afraid of myself. When I returned to Petersburg, I\\r\\npromised myself to make a point of seeing our greatest men, and members\\r\\nof our oldest familiesâ\\x80\\x94the old families like my own. I am now among\\r\\nprinces like myself, am I not? I wished to know you, and it was\\r\\nnecessary, very, very necessary. I had always heard so much that was\\r\\nevil said of you allâ\\x80\\x94more evil than good; as to how small and petty\\r\\nwere your interests, how absurd your habits, how shallow your\\r\\neducation, and so on. There is so much written and said about you! I\\r\\ncame here today with anxious curiosity; I wished to see for myself and\\r\\nform my own convictions as to whether it were true that the whole of\\r\\nthis upper stratum of Russian society is _worthless_, has outlived its\\r\\ntime, has existed too long, and is only fit to dieâ\\x80\\x94and yet is dying\\r\\nwith petty, spiteful warring against that which is destined to\\r\\nsupersede it and take its placeâ\\x80\\x94hindering the Coming Men, and knowing\\r\\nnot that itself is in a dying condition. I did not fully believe in\\r\\nthis view even before, for there never was such a class among\\r\\nusâ\\x80\\x94excepting perhaps at court, by accidentâ\\x80\\x94or by uniform; but now there\\r\\nis not even that, is there? It has vanished, has it not?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, not a bit of it,â\\x80\\x9d said Ivan Petrovitch, with a sarcastic laugh.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood Lord, heâ\\x80\\x99s off again!â\\x80\\x9d said Princess Bielokonski, impatiently.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLaissez-le dire! He is trembling all over,â\\x80\\x9d said the old man, in a\\r\\nwarning whisper.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince certainly was beside himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell? What have I seen?â\\x80\\x9d he continued. â\\x80\\x9cI have seen men of graceful\\r\\nsimplicity of intellect; I have seen an old man who is not above\\r\\nspeaking kindly and even _listening_ to a boy like myself; I see before\\r\\nme persons who can understand, who can forgiveâ\\x80\\x94kind, good Russian\\r\\nheartsâ\\x80\\x94hearts almost as kind and cordial as I met abroad. Imagine how\\r\\ndelighted I must have been, and how surprised! Oh, let me express this\\r\\nfeeling! I have so often heard, and I have even believed, that in\\r\\nsociety there was nothing but empty forms, and that reality had\\r\\nvanished; but I now see for myself that this can never be the case\\r\\n_here_, among usâ\\x80\\x94it may be the order elsewhere, but not in Russia.\\r\\nSurely you are not all Jesuits and deceivers! I heard Prince N.â\\x80\\x98s story\\r\\njust now. Was it not simple-minded, spontaneous humour? Could such\\r\\nwords come from the lips of a man who is dead?â\\x80\\x94a man whose heart and\\r\\ntalents are dried up? Could dead men and women have treated me so\\r\\nkindly as you have all been treating me to-day? Is there not material\\r\\nfor the future in all thisâ\\x80\\x94for hope? Can such people fail to\\r\\n_understand?_ Can such men fall away from reality?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOnce more let us beg you to be calm, my dear boy. Weâ\\x80\\x99ll talk of all\\r\\nthis another timeâ\\x80\\x94I shall do so with the greatest pleasure, for one,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nsaid the old dignitary, with a smile.\\r\\n\\r\\nIvan Petrovitch grunted and twisted round in his chair. General\\r\\nEpanchin moved nervously. The latterâ\\x80\\x99s chief had started a conversation\\r\\nwith the wife of the dignitary, and took no notice whatever of the\\r\\nprince, but the old lady very often glanced at him, and listened to\\r\\nwhat he was saying.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I had better speak,â\\x80\\x9d continued the prince, with a new outburst of\\r\\nfeverish emotion, and turning towards the old man with an air of\\r\\nconfidential trustfulness. â\\x80\\x9cYesterday, Aglaya Ivanovna forbade me to\\r\\ntalk, and even specified the particular subjects I must not touch\\r\\nuponâ\\x80\\x94she knows well enough that I am odd when I get upon these matters.\\r\\nI am nearly twenty-seven years old, and yet I know I am little better\\r\\nthan a child. I have no right to express my ideas, and said so long\\r\\nago. Only in Moscow, with Rogojin, did I ever speak absolutely freely!\\r\\nHe and I read Pushkin togetherâ\\x80\\x94all his works. Rogojin knew nothing of\\r\\nPushkin, had not even heard his name. I am always afraid of spoiling a\\r\\ngreat Thought or Idea by my absurd manner. I have no eloquence, I know.\\r\\nI always make the wrong gesturesâ\\x80\\x94inappropriate gesturesâ\\x80\\x94and therefore I\\r\\ndegrade the Thought, and raise a laugh instead of doing my subject\\r\\njustice. I have no sense of proportion either, and that is the chief\\r\\nthing. I know it would be much better if I were always to sit still and\\r\\nsay nothing. When I do so, I appear to be quite a sensible sort of a\\r\\nperson, and whatâ\\x80\\x99s more, I think about things. But now I must speak; it\\r\\nis better that I should. I began to speak because you looked so kindly\\r\\nat me; you have such a beautiful face. I promised Aglaya Ivanovna\\r\\nyesterday that I would not speak all the evening.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cReally?â\\x80\\x9d said the old man, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut, at times, I canâ\\x80\\x99t help thinking that I am wrong in feeling so\\r\\nabout it, you know. Sincerity is more important than elocution, isnâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nit?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSometimes.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI want to explain all to youâ\\x80\\x94everythingâ\\x80\\x94everything! I know you think\\r\\nme Utopian, donâ\\x80\\x99t youâ\\x80\\x94an idealist? Oh, no! Iâ\\x80\\x99m not, indeedâ\\x80\\x94my ideas are\\r\\nall so simple. You donâ\\x80\\x99t believe me? You are smiling. Do you know, I am\\r\\nsometimes very wickedâ\\x80\\x94for I lose my faith? This evening as I came here,\\r\\nI thought to myself, â\\x80\\x98What shall I talk about? How am I to begin, so\\r\\nthat they may be able to understand partially, at all events?â\\x80\\x99 How\\r\\nafraid I wasâ\\x80\\x94dreadfully afraid! And yet, how _could_ I be afraidâ\\x80\\x94was it\\r\\nnot shameful of me? Was I afraid of finding a bottomless abyss of empty\\r\\nselfishness? Ah! thatâ\\x80\\x99s why I am so happy at this moment, because I\\r\\nfind there is no bottomless abyss at allâ\\x80\\x94but good, healthy material,\\r\\nfull of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is not such a very dreadful circumstance that we are odd people, is\\r\\nit? For we really are odd, you knowâ\\x80\\x94careless, reckless, easily wearied\\r\\nof anything. We donâ\\x80\\x99t look thoroughly into mattersâ\\x80\\x94donâ\\x80\\x99t care to\\r\\nunderstand things. We are all like thisâ\\x80\\x94you and I, and all of them!\\r\\nWhy, here are you, nowâ\\x80\\x94you are not a bit angry with me for calling you\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98odd,â\\x80\\x99 are you? And, if so, surely there is good material in you? Do\\r\\nyou know, I sometimes think it is a good thing to be odd. We can\\r\\nforgive one another more easily, and be more humble. No one can begin\\r\\nby being perfectâ\\x80\\x94there is much one cannot understand in life at first.\\r\\nIn order to attain to perfection, one must begin by failing to\\r\\nunderstand much. And if we take in knowledge too quickly, we very\\r\\nlikely are not taking it in at all. I say all this to youâ\\x80\\x94you who by\\r\\nthis time understand so muchâ\\x80\\x94and doubtless have failed to understand so\\r\\nmuch, also. I am not afraid of you any longer. You are not angry that a\\r\\nmere boy should say such words to you, are you? Of course not! You know\\r\\nhow to forget and to forgive. You are laughing, Ivan Petrovitch? You\\r\\nthink I am a champion of other classes of peopleâ\\x80\\x94that I am _their_\\r\\nadvocate, a democrat, and an orator of Equality?â\\x80\\x9d The prince laughed\\r\\nhysterically; he had several times burst into these little, short\\r\\nnervous laughs. â\\x80\\x9cOh, noâ\\x80\\x94it is for you, for myself, and for all of us\\r\\ntogether, that I am alarmed. I am a prince of an old family myself, and\\r\\nI am sitting among my peers; and I am talking like this in the hope of\\r\\nsaving us all; in the hope that our class will not disappear\\r\\naltogetherâ\\x80\\x94into the darknessâ\\x80\\x94unguessing its dangerâ\\x80\\x94blaming everything\\r\\naround it, and losing ground every day. Why should we disappear and\\r\\ngive place to others, when we may still, if we choose, remain in the\\r\\nfront rank and lead the battle? Let us be servants, that we may become\\r\\nlords in due season!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe tried to get upon his feet again, but the old man still restrained\\r\\nhim, gazing at him with increasing perturbation as he went on.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cListenâ\\x80\\x94I know it is best not to speak! It is best simply to give a\\r\\ngood exampleâ\\x80\\x94simply to begin the work. I have done thisâ\\x80\\x94I have begun,\\r\\nandâ\\x80\\x94andâ\\x80\\x94oh! _can_ anyone be unhappy, really? Oh! what does grief\\r\\nmatterâ\\x80\\x94what does misfortune matter, if one knows how to be happy? Do\\r\\nyou know, I cannot understand how anyone can pass by a green tree, and\\r\\nnot feel happy only to look at it! How anyone can talk to a man and not\\r\\nfeel happy in loving him! Oh, it is my own fault that I cannot express\\r\\nmyself well enough! But there are lovely things at every step I\\r\\ntakeâ\\x80\\x94things which even the most miserable man must recognize as\\r\\nbeautiful. Look at a little childâ\\x80\\x94look at Godâ\\x80\\x99s day dawnâ\\x80\\x94look at the\\r\\ngrass growingâ\\x80\\x94look at the eyes that love you, as they gaze back into\\r\\nyour eyes!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had risen, and was speaking standing up. The old gentleman was\\r\\nlooking at him now in unconcealed alarm. Lizabetha Prokofievna wrung\\r\\nher hands. â\\x80\\x9cOh, my God!â\\x80\\x9d she cried. She had guessed the state of the\\r\\ncase before anyone else.\\r\\n\\r\\nAglaya rushed quickly up to him, and was just in time to receive him in\\r\\nher arms, and to hear with dread and horror that awful, wild cry as he\\r\\nfell writhing to the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere he lay on the carpet, and someone quickly placed a cushion under\\r\\nhis head.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one had expected this.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a quarter of an hour or so Prince N. and Evgenie Pavlovitch and the\\r\\nold dignitary were hard at work endeavouring to restore the harmony of\\r\\nthe evening, but it was of no avail, and very soon after the guests\\r\\nseparated and went their ways.\\r\\n\\r\\nA great deal of sympathy was expressed; a considerable amount of advice\\r\\nwas volunteered; Ivan Petrovitch expressed his opinion that the young\\r\\nman was â\\x80\\x9ca Slavophile, or something of that sortâ\\x80\\x9d; but that it was not\\r\\na dangerous development. The old dignitary said nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrue enough, most of the guests, next day and the day after, were not\\r\\nin very good humour. Ivan Petrovitch was a little offended, but not\\r\\nseriously so. General Epanchinâ\\x80\\x99s chief was rather cool towards him for\\r\\nsome while after the occurrence. The old dignitary, as patron of the\\r\\nfamily, took the opportunity of murmuring some kind of admonition to\\r\\nthe general, and added, in flattering terms, that he was most\\r\\ninterested in Aglayaâ\\x80\\x99s future. He was a man who really did possess a\\r\\nkind heart, although his interest in the prince, in the earlier part of\\r\\nthe evening, was due, among other reasons, to the latterâ\\x80\\x99s connection\\r\\nwith Nastasia Philipovna, according to popular report. He had heard a\\r\\ngood deal of this story here and there, and was greatly interested in\\r\\nit, so much so that he longed to ask further questions about it.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrincess Bielokonski, as she drove away on this eventful evening, took\\r\\noccasion to say to Lizabetha Prokofievna:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWellâ\\x80\\x94heâ\\x80\\x99s a good matchâ\\x80\\x94and a bad one; and if you want my opinion, more\\r\\nbad than good. You can see for yourself the man is an invalid.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLizabetha therefore decided that the prince was impossible as a husband\\r\\nfor Aglaya; and during the ensuing night she made a vow that never\\r\\nwhile she lived should he marry Aglaya. With this resolve firmly\\r\\nimpressed upon her mind, she awoke next day; but during the morning,\\r\\nafter her early lunch, she fell into a condition of remarkable\\r\\ninconsistency.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn reply to a very guarded question of her sistersâ\\x80\\x99, Aglaya had\\r\\nanswered coldly, but exceedingly haughtily:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have never given him my word at all, nor have I ever counted him as\\r\\nmy future husbandâ\\x80\\x94never in my life. He is just as little to me as all\\r\\nthe rest.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLizabetha Prokofievna suddenly flared up.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI did not expect that of you, Aglaya,â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cHe is an impossible\\r\\nhusband for you,â\\x80\\x94I know it; and thank God that we agree upon that\\r\\npoint; but I did not expect to hear such words from you. I thought I\\r\\nshould hear a very different tone from you. I would have turned out\\r\\neveryone who was in the room last night and kept him,â\\x80\\x94thatâ\\x80\\x99s the sort\\r\\nof man he is, in my opinion!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHere she suddenly paused, afraid of what she had just said. But she\\r\\nlittle knew how unfair she was to her daughter at that moment. It was\\r\\nall settled in Aglayaâ\\x80\\x99s mind. She was only waiting for the hour that\\r\\nwould bring the matter to a final climax; and every hint, every\\r\\ncareless probing of her wound, did but further lacerate her heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nVIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis same morning dawned for the prince pregnant with no less painful\\r\\npresentiments,â\\x80\\x94which fact his physical state was, of course, quite\\r\\nenough to account for; but he was so indefinably melancholy,â\\x80\\x94his\\r\\nsadness could not attach itself to anything in particular, and this\\r\\ntormented him more than anything else. Of course certain facts stood\\r\\nbefore him, clear and painful, but his sadness went beyond all that he\\r\\ncould remember or imagine; he realized that he was powerless to console\\r\\nhimself unaided. Little by little he began to develop the expectation\\r\\nthat this day something important, something decisive, was to happen to\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis attack of yesterday had been a slight one. Excepting some little\\r\\nheaviness in the head and pain in the limbs, he did not feel any\\r\\nparticular effects. His brain worked all right, though his soul was\\r\\nheavy within him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe rose late, and immediately upon waking remembered all about the\\r\\nprevious evening; he also remembered, though not quite so clearly, how,\\r\\nhalf an hour after his fit, he had been carried home.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe soon heard that a messenger from the Epanchinsâ\\x80\\x99 had already been to\\r\\ninquire after him. At half-past eleven another arrived; and this\\r\\npleased him.\\r\\n\\r\\nVera Lebedeff was one of the first to come to see him and offer her\\r\\nservices. No sooner did she catch sight of him than she burst into\\r\\ntears; but when he tried to soothe her she began to laugh. He was quite\\r\\nstruck by the girlâ\\x80\\x99s deep sympathy for him; he seized her hand and\\r\\nkissed it. Vera flushed crimson.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, donâ\\x80\\x99t, donâ\\x80\\x99t!â\\x80\\x9d she exclaimed in alarm, snatching her hand away.\\r\\nShe went hastily out of the room in a state of strange confusion.\\r\\n\\r\\nLebedeff also came to see the prince, in a great hurry to get away to\\r\\nthe â\\x80\\x9cdeceased,â\\x80\\x9d as he called General Ivolgin, who was alive still, but\\r\\nvery ill. Colia also turned up, and begged the prince for pityâ\\x80\\x99s sake\\r\\nto tell him all he knew about his father which had been concealed from\\r\\nhim till now. He said he had found out nearly everything since\\r\\nyesterday; the poor boy was in a state of deep affliction. With all the\\r\\nsympathy which he could bring into play, the prince told Colia the\\r\\nwhole story without reserve, detailing the facts as clearly as he\\r\\ncould. The tale struck Colia like a thunderbolt. He could not speak. He\\r\\nlistened silently, and cried softly to himself the while. The prince\\r\\nperceived that this was an impression which would last for the whole of\\r\\nthe boyâ\\x80\\x99s life. He made haste to explain his view of the matter, and\\r\\npointed out that the old manâ\\x80\\x99s approaching death was probably brought\\r\\non by horror at the thought of his action; and that it was not everyone\\r\\nwho was capable of such a feeling.\\r\\n\\r\\nColiaâ\\x80\\x99s eyes flashed as he listened.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGania and Varia and Ptitsin are a worthless lot! I shall not quarrel\\r\\nwith them; but from this moment our feet shall not travel the same\\r\\nroad. Oh, prince, I have felt much that is quite new to me since\\r\\nyesterday! It is a lesson for me. I shall now consider my mother as\\r\\nentirely my responsibility; though she may be safe enough with Varia.\\r\\nStill, meat and drink is not everything.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe jumped up and hurried off, remembering suddenly that he was wanted\\r\\nat his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s bedside; but before he went out of the room he inquired\\r\\nhastily after the princeâ\\x80\\x99s health, and receiving the latterâ\\x80\\x99s reply,\\r\\nadded:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIsnâ\\x80\\x99t there something else, prince? I heard yesterday, but I have no\\r\\nright to talk about this... If you ever want a true friend and\\r\\nservantâ\\x80\\x94neither you nor I are so very happy, are we?â\\x80\\x94come to me. I\\r\\nwonâ\\x80\\x99t ask you questions, though.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe ran off and left the prince more dejected than ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nEveryone seemed to be speaking prophetically, hinting at some\\r\\nmisfortune or sorrow to come; they had all looked at him as though they\\r\\nknew something which he did not know. Lebedeff had asked questions,\\r\\nColia had hinted, and Vera had shed tears. What was it?\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, with a sigh of annoyance, he said to himself that it was\\r\\nnothing but his own cursed sickly suspicion. His face lighted up with\\r\\njoy when, at about two oâ\\x80\\x99clock, he espied the Epanchins coming along to\\r\\npay him a short visit, â\\x80\\x9cjust for a minute.â\\x80\\x9d They really had only come\\r\\nfor a minute.\\r\\n\\r\\nLizabetha Prokofievna had announced, directly after lunch, that they\\r\\nwould all take a walk together. The information was given in the form\\r\\nof a command, without explanation, drily and abruptly. All had issued\\r\\nforth in obedience to the mandate; that is, the girls, mamma, and\\r\\nPrince S. Lizabetha Prokofievna went off in a direction exactly\\r\\ncontrary to the usual one, and all understood very well what she was\\r\\ndriving at, but held their peace, fearing to irritate the good lady.\\r\\nShe, as though anxious to avoid any conversation, walked ahead, silent\\r\\nand alone. At last Adelaida remarked that it was no use racing along at\\r\\nsuch a pace, and that she could not keep up with her mother.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLook here,â\\x80\\x9d said Lizabetha Prokofievna, turning round suddenly; â\\x80\\x9cwe\\r\\nare passing his house. Whatever Aglaya may think, and in spite of\\r\\nanything that may happen, he is not a stranger to us; besides which, he\\r\\nis ill and in misfortune. I, for one, shall call in and see him. Let\\r\\nanyone follow me who cares to.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course every one of them followed her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince hastened to apologize, very properly, for yesterdayâ\\x80\\x99s mishap\\r\\nwith the vase, and for the scene generally.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, thatâ\\x80\\x99s nothing,â\\x80\\x9d replied Lizabetha; â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m not sorry for the vase,\\r\\nIâ\\x80\\x99m sorry for you. Hâ\\x80\\x99m! so you can see that there was a â\\x80\\x98scene,â\\x80\\x99 can\\r\\nyou? Well, it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t matter much, for everyone must realize now that\\r\\nit is impossible to be hard on you. Well, _au revoir_. I advise you to\\r\\nhave a walk, and then go to sleep again if you can. Come in as usual,\\r\\nif you feel inclined; and be assured, once for all, whatever happens,\\r\\nand whatever may have happened, you shall always remain the friend of\\r\\nthe familyâ\\x80\\x94mine, at all events. I can answer for myself.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn response to this challenge all the others chimed in and re-echoed\\r\\nmammaâ\\x80\\x99s sentiments.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so they took their departure; but in this hasty and kindly designed\\r\\nvisit there was hidden a fund of cruelty which Lizabetha Prokofievna\\r\\nnever dreamed of. In the words â\\x80\\x9cas usual,â\\x80\\x9d and again in her added,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmine, at all events,â\\x80\\x9d there seemed an ominous knell of some evil to\\r\\ncome.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince began to think of Aglaya. She had certainly given him a\\r\\nwonderful smile, both at coming and again at leave-taking, but had not\\r\\nsaid a word, not even when the others all professed their friendship\\r\\nfor him. She had looked very intently at him, but that was all. Her\\r\\nface had been paler than usual; she looked as though she had slept\\r\\nbadly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince made up his mind that he would make a point of going there\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cas usual,â\\x80\\x9d tonight, and looked feverishly at his watch.\\r\\n\\r\\nVera came in three minutes after the Epanchins had left. â\\x80\\x9cLef\\r\\nNicolaievitch,â\\x80\\x9d she said, â\\x80\\x9cAglaya Ivanovna has just given me a message\\r\\nfor you.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince trembled.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs it a note?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, a verbal message; she had hardly time even for that. She begs you\\r\\nearnestly not to go out of the house for a single moment all to-day,\\r\\nuntil seven oâ\\x80\\x99clock in the evening. It may have been nine; I didnâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nquite hear.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cButâ\\x80\\x94but, why is this? What does it mean?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know at all; but she said I was to tell you particularly.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDid she say that?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot those very words. She only just had time to whisper as she went\\r\\nby; but by the way she looked at me I knew it was important. She looked\\r\\nat me in a way that made my heart stop beating.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince asked a few more questions, and though he learned nothing\\r\\nelse, he became more and more agitated.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeft alone, he lay down on the sofa, and began to think.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPerhaps,â\\x80\\x9d he thought, â\\x80\\x9csomeone is to be with them until nine tonight\\r\\nand she is afraid that I may come and make a fool of myself again, in\\r\\npublic.â\\x80\\x9d So he spent his time longing for the evening and looking at\\r\\nhis watch. But the clearing-up of the mystery came long before the\\r\\nevening, and came in the form of a new and agonizing riddle.\\r\\n\\r\\nHalf an hour after the Epanchins had gone, Hippolyte arrived, so tired\\r\\nthat, almost unconscious, he sank into a chair, and broke into such a\\r\\nfit of coughing that he could not stop. He coughed till the blood came.\\r\\nHis eyes glittered, and two red spots on his cheeks grew brighter and\\r\\nbrighter. The prince murmured something to him, but Hippolyte only\\r\\nsigned that he must be left alone for a while, and sat silent. At last\\r\\nhe came to himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am off,â\\x80\\x9d he said, hoarsely, and with difficulty.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShall I see you home?â\\x80\\x9d asked the prince, rising from his seat, but\\r\\nsuddenly stopping short as he remembered Aglayaâ\\x80\\x99s prohibition against\\r\\nleaving the house. Hippolyte laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t mean that I am going to leave your house,â\\x80\\x9d he continued, still\\r\\ngasping and coughing. â\\x80\\x9cOn the contrary, I thought it absolutely\\r\\nnecessary to come and see you; otherwise I should not have troubled\\r\\nyou. I am off there, you know, and this time I believe, seriously, that\\r\\nI am off! Itâ\\x80\\x99s all over. I did not come here for sympathy, believe me.\\r\\nI lay down this morning at ten oâ\\x80\\x99clock with the intention of not rising\\r\\nagain before that time; but I thought it over and rose just once more\\r\\nin order to come here; from which you may deduce that I had some reason\\r\\nfor wishing to come.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt grieves me to see you so, Hippolyte. Why didnâ\\x80\\x99t you send me a\\r\\nmessage? I would have come up and saved you this trouble.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, well! Enough! Youâ\\x80\\x99ve pitied me, and thatâ\\x80\\x99s all that good manners\\r\\nexact. I forgot, how are you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m all right; yesterday I was a littleâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know, I heard; the china vase caught it! Iâ\\x80\\x99m sorry I wasnâ\\x80\\x99t there.\\r\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ve come about something important. In the first place I had, the\\r\\npleasure of seeing Gavrila Ardalionovitch and Aglaya Ivanovna enjoying\\r\\na rendezvous on the green bench in the park. I was astonished to see\\r\\nwhat a fool a man can look. I remarked upon the fact to Aglaya Ivanovna\\r\\nwhen he had gone. I donâ\\x80\\x99t think anything ever surprises you, prince!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nadded Hippolyte, gazing incredulously at the princeâ\\x80\\x99s calm demeanour.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTo be astonished by nothing is a sign, they say, of a great intellect.\\r\\nIn my opinion it would serve equally well as a sign of great\\r\\nfoolishness. I am not hinting about you; pardon me! I am very\\r\\nunfortunate today in my expressions.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI knew yesterday that Gavrila Ardalionovitchâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d began the prince, and\\r\\npaused in evident confusion, though Hippolyte had shown annoyance at\\r\\nhis betraying no surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou knew it? Come, thatâ\\x80\\x99s news! But noâ\\x80\\x94perhaps better not tell me. And\\r\\nwere you a witness of the meeting?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf you were there yourself you must have known that I was _not_\\r\\nthere!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh! but you may have been sitting behind the bushes somewhere.\\r\\nHowever, I am very glad, on your account, of course. I was beginning to\\r\\nbe afraid that Mr. Ganiaâ\\x80\\x94might have the preference!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMay I ask you, Hippolyte, not to talk of this subject? And not to use\\r\\nsuch expressions?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEspecially as you know all, eh?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are wrong. I know scarcely anything, and Aglaya Ivanovna is aware\\r\\nthat I know nothing. I knew nothing whatever about this meeting. You\\r\\nsay there was a meeting. Very well; letâ\\x80\\x99s leave it soâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, what do you mean? You said you knew, and now suddenly you know\\r\\nnothing! You say â\\x80\\x98very well; letâ\\x80\\x99s leave it so.â\\x80\\x99 But I say, donâ\\x80\\x99t be so\\r\\nconfiding, especially as you know nothing. You are confiding simply\\r\\n_because_ you know nothing. But do you know what these good people have\\r\\nin their mindsâ\\x80\\x99 eyeâ\\x80\\x94Gania and his sister? Perhaps you are suspicious?\\r\\nWell, well, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll drop the subject!â\\x80\\x9d he added, hastily, observing the\\r\\nprinceâ\\x80\\x99s impatient gesture. â\\x80\\x9cBut Iâ\\x80\\x99ve come to you on my own business; I\\r\\nwish to make you a clear explanation. What a nuisance it is that one\\r\\ncannot die without explanations! I have made such a quantity of them\\r\\nalready. Do you wish to hear what I have to say?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSpeak away, I am listening.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery well, but Iâ\\x80\\x99ll change my mind, and begin about Gania. Just fancy\\r\\nto begin with, if you can, that I, too, was given an appointment at the\\r\\ngreen bench today! However, I wonâ\\x80\\x99t deceive you; I asked for the\\r\\nappointment. I said I had a secret to disclose. I donâ\\x80\\x99t know whether I\\r\\ncame there too early, I think I must have; but scarcely had I sat down\\r\\nbeside Aglaya Ivanovna than I saw Gavrila Ardalionovitch and his sister\\r\\nVaria coming along, arm in arm, just as though they were enjoying a\\r\\nmorning walk together. Both of them seemed very much astonished, not to\\r\\nsay disturbed, at seeing me; they evidently had not expected the\\r\\npleasure. Aglaya Ivanovna blushed up, and was actually a little\\r\\nconfused. I donâ\\x80\\x99t know whether it was merely because I was there, or\\r\\nwhether Ganiaâ\\x80\\x99s beauty was too much for her! But anyway, she turned\\r\\ncrimson, and then finished up the business in a very funny manner. She\\r\\njumped up from her seat, bowed back to Gania, smiled to Varia, and\\r\\nsuddenly observed: â\\x80\\x98I only came here to express my gratitude for all\\r\\nyour kind wishes on my behalf, and to say that if I find I need your\\r\\nservices, believe meâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x99 Here she bowed them away, as it were, and they\\r\\nboth marched off again, looking very foolish. Gania evidently could not\\r\\nmake head nor tail of the matter, and turned as red as a lobster; but\\r\\nVaria understood at once that they must get away as quickly as they\\r\\ncould, so she dragged Gania away; she is a great deal cleverer than he\\r\\nis. As for myself, I went there to arrange a meeting to be held between\\r\\nAglaya Ivanovna and Nastasia Philipovna.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNastasia Philipovna!â\\x80\\x9d cried the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAha! I think you are growing less cool, my friend, and are beginning\\r\\nto be a trifle surprised, arenâ\\x80\\x99t you? Iâ\\x80\\x99m glad that you are not above\\r\\nordinary human feelings, for once. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll console you a little now, after\\r\\nyour consternation. See what I get for serving a young and high-souled\\r\\nmaiden! This morning I received a slap in the face from the lady!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAâ\\x80\\x94a moral one?â\\x80\\x9d asked the prince, involuntarily.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYesâ\\x80\\x94not a physical one! I donâ\\x80\\x99t suppose anyoneâ\\x80\\x94even a womanâ\\x80\\x94would\\r\\nraise a hand against me now. Even Gania would hesitate! I did think at\\r\\none time yesterday, that he would fly at me, though. I bet anything\\r\\nthat I know what you are thinking of now! You are thinking: â\\x80\\x98Of course\\r\\none canâ\\x80\\x99t strike the little wretch, but one could suffocate him with a\\r\\npillow, or a wet towel, when he is asleep! One _ought_ to get rid of\\r\\nhim somehow.â\\x80\\x99 I can see in your face that you are thinking that at this\\r\\nvery second.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI never thought of such a thing for a moment,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, with\\r\\ndisgust.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t knowâ\\x80\\x94I dreamed last night that I was being suffocated with a\\r\\nwet cloth byâ\\x80\\x94somebody. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you who it wasâ\\x80\\x94Rogojin! What do you\\r\\nthink, can a man be suffocated with a wet cloth?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve heard so. Well, weâ\\x80\\x99ll leave that question just now. Why am I a\\r\\nscandal-monger? Why did she call me a scandal-monger? And mind, _after_\\r\\nshe had heard every word I had to tell her, and had asked all sorts of\\r\\nquestions besidesâ\\x80\\x94but such is the way of women. For _her_ sake I\\r\\nentered into relations with Rogojinâ\\x80\\x94an interesting man! At _her_\\r\\nrequest I arranged a personal interview between herself and Nastasia\\r\\nPhilipovna. Could she have been angry because I hinted that she was\\r\\nenjoying Nastasia Philipovnaâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x98leavingsâ\\x80\\x99? Why, I have been impressing\\r\\nit upon her all this while for her own good. Two letters have I written\\r\\nher in that strain, and I began straight off today about its being\\r\\nhumiliating for her. Besides, the word â\\x80\\x98leavingsâ\\x80\\x99 is not my invention.\\r\\nAt all events, they all used it at Ganiaâ\\x80\\x99s, and she used it herself. So\\r\\nwhy am I a scandal-monger? I seeâ\\x80\\x94I see you are tremendously amused, at\\r\\nthis moment! Probably you are laughing at me and fitting those silly\\r\\nlines to my caseâ\\x80\\x94\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Maybe sad Love upon his setting smiles, And with vain hopes his\\r\\nfarewell hour beguiles.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHa, ha, ha!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHippolyte suddenly burst into a fit of hysterical laughter, which\\r\\nturned into a choking cough.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cObserve,â\\x80\\x9d he gasped, through his coughing, â\\x80\\x9cwhat a fellow Gania is! He\\r\\ntalks about Nastasiaâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x98leavings,â\\x80\\x99 but what does he want to take\\r\\nhimself?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince sat silent for a long while. His mind was filled with dread\\r\\nand horror.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou spoke of a meeting with Nastasia Philipovna,â\\x80\\x9d he said at last, in\\r\\na low voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOhâ\\x80\\x94come! Surely you must know that there is to be a meeting today\\r\\nbetween Nastasia and Aglaya Ivanovna, and that Nastasia has been sent\\r\\nfor on purpose, through Rogojin, from St. Petersburg? It has been\\r\\nbrought about by invitation of Aglaya Ivanovna and my own efforts, and\\r\\nNastasia is at this moment with Rogojin, not far from hereâ\\x80\\x94at Dana\\r\\nAlexeyevnaâ\\x80\\x99sâ\\x80\\x94that curious friend of hers; and to this questionable\\r\\nhouse Aglaya Ivanovna is to proceed for a friendly chat with Nastasia\\r\\nPhilipovna, and for the settlement of several problems. They are going\\r\\nto play at arithmeticâ\\x80\\x94didnâ\\x80\\x99t you know about it? Word of honour?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a most improbable story.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, very well! if itâ\\x80\\x99s improbableâ\\x80\\x94it isâ\\x80\\x94thatâ\\x80\\x99s all! And yetâ\\x80\\x94where\\r\\nshould you have heard it? Though I must say, if a fly crosses the room\\r\\nitâ\\x80\\x99s known all over the place here. However, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve warned you, and you\\r\\nmay be grateful to me. Wellâ\\x80\\x94_au revoir_â\\x80\\x94probably in the next world! One\\r\\nmore thingâ\\x80\\x94donâ\\x80\\x99t think that I am telling you all this for your sake.\\r\\nOh, dear, no! Do you know that I dedicated my confession to Aglaya\\r\\nIvanovna? I did though, and how she took it, ha, ha! Oh, no! I am not\\r\\nacting from any high, exalted motives. But though I may have behaved\\r\\nlike a cad to you, I have not done _her_ any harm. I donâ\\x80\\x99t apologize\\r\\nfor my words about â\\x80\\x98leavingsâ\\x80\\x99 and all that. I am atoning for that, you\\r\\nsee, by telling you the place and time of the meeting. Goodbye! You had\\r\\nbetter take your measures, if you are worthy the name of a man! The\\r\\nmeeting is fixed for this eveningâ\\x80\\x94thatâ\\x80\\x99s certain.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHippolyte walked towards the door, but the prince called him back and\\r\\nhe stopped.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen you think Aglaya Ivanovna herself intends to go to Nastasia\\r\\nPhilipovnaâ\\x80\\x99s tonight?â\\x80\\x9d he asked, and bright hectic spots came out on\\r\\nhis cheeks and forehead.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know absolutely for certain; but in all probability it is so,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nreplied Hippolyte, looking round. â\\x80\\x9cNastasia would hardly go to her; and\\r\\nthey canâ\\x80\\x99t meet at Ganiaâ\\x80\\x99s, with a man nearly dead in the house.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s impossible, for that very reason,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince. â\\x80\\x9cHow would\\r\\nshe get out if she wished to? You donâ\\x80\\x99t know the habits of that\\r\\nhouseâ\\x80\\x94she _could_ not get away alone to Nastasia Philipovnaâ\\x80\\x99s! Itâ\\x80\\x99s all\\r\\nnonsense!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLook here, my dear prince, no one jumps out of the window if they can\\r\\nhelp it; but when thereâ\\x80\\x99s a fire, the dandiest gentleman or the finest\\r\\nlady in the world will skip out! When the moment comes, and thereâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nnothing else to be doneâ\\x80\\x94our young lady will go to Nastasia\\r\\nPhilipovnaâ\\x80\\x99s! Donâ\\x80\\x99t they let the young ladies out of the house alone,\\r\\nthen?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI didnâ\\x80\\x99t mean that exactly.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf you didnâ\\x80\\x99t mean that, then she has only to go down the steps and\\r\\nwalk off, and she need never come back unless she chooses: Ships are\\r\\nburned behind one sometimes, and one doesnâ\\x80\\x99t care to return whence one\\r\\ncame. Life need not consist only of lunches, and dinners, and Prince\\r\\nSâ\\x80\\x99s. It strikes me you take Aglaya Ivanovna for some conventional\\r\\nboarding-school girl. I said so to her, and she quite agreed with me.\\r\\nWait till seven or eight oâ\\x80\\x99clock. In your place I would send someone\\r\\nthere to keep watch, so as to seize the exact moment when she steps out\\r\\nof the house. Send Colia. Heâ\\x80\\x99ll play the spy with pleasureâ\\x80\\x94for you at\\r\\nleast. Ha, ha, ha!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHippolyte went out.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no reason for the prince to set anyone to watch, even if he\\r\\nhad been capable of such a thing. Aglayaâ\\x80\\x99s command that he should stay\\r\\nat home all day seemed almost explained now. Perhaps she meant to call\\r\\nfor him, herself, or it might be, of course, that she was anxious to\\r\\nmake sure of his not coming there, and therefore bade him remain at\\r\\nhome. His head whirled; the whole room seemed to be turning round. He\\r\\nlay down on the sofa, and closed his eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne way or the other the question was to be decided at lastâ\\x80\\x94finally.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, no, he did not think of Aglaya as a boarding-school miss, or a\\r\\nyoung lady of the conventional type! He had long since feared that she\\r\\nmight take some such step as this. But why did she wish to see\\r\\nNastasia?\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shivered all over as he lay; he was in high fever again.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo! he did not account her a child. Certain of her looks, certain of\\r\\nher words, of late, had filled him with apprehension. At times it had\\r\\nstruck him that she was putting too great a restraint upon herself, and\\r\\nhe remembered that he had been alarmed to observe this. He had tried,\\r\\nall these days, to drive away the heavy thoughts that oppressed him;\\r\\nbut what was the hidden mystery of that soul? The question had long\\r\\ntormented him, although he implicitly trusted that soul. And now it was\\r\\nall to be cleared up. It was a dreadful thought. And â\\x80\\x9cthat womanâ\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nagain! Why did he always feel as though â\\x80\\x9cthat womanâ\\x80\\x9d were fated to\\r\\nappear at each critical moment of his life, and tear the thread of his\\r\\ndestiny like a bit of rotten string? That he always _had_ felt this he\\r\\nwas ready to swear, although he was half delirious at the moment. If he\\r\\nhad tried to forget her, all this time, it was simply because he was\\r\\nafraid of her. Did he love the woman or hate her? This question he did\\r\\nnot once ask himself today; his heart was quite pure. He knew whom he\\r\\nloved. He was not so much afraid of this meeting, nor of its\\r\\nstrangeness, nor of any reasons there might be for it, unknown to\\r\\nhimself; he was afraid of the woman herself, Nastasia Philipovna. He\\r\\nremembered, some days afterwards, how during all those fevered hours he\\r\\nhad seen but _her_ eyes, _her_ look, had heard _her_ voice, strange\\r\\nwords of hers; he remembered that this was so, although he could not\\r\\nrecollect the details of his thoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe could remember that Vera brought him some dinner, and that he took\\r\\nit; but whether he slept after dinner, or no, he could not recollect.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe only knew that he began to distinguish things clearly from the\\r\\nmoment when Aglaya suddenly appeared, and he jumped up from the sofa\\r\\nand went to meet her. It was just a quarter past seven then.\\r\\n\\r\\nAglaya was quite alone, and dressed, apparently hastily, in a light\\r\\nmantle. Her face was pale, as it had been in the morning, and her eyes\\r\\nwere ablaze with bright but subdued fire. He had never seen that\\r\\nexpression in her eyes before.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe gazed attentively at him.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are quite ready, I observe,â\\x80\\x9d she said, with absolute composure,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdressed, and your hat in your hand. I see somebody has thought fit to\\r\\nwarn you, and I know who. Hippolyte?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, he told me,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, feeling only half alive.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome then. You know, I suppose, that you must escort me there? You are\\r\\nwell enough to go out, arenâ\\x80\\x99t you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am well enough; but is it really possible?â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe broke off abruptly, and could not add another word. This was his one\\r\\nattempt to stop the mad child, and, after he had made it, he followed\\r\\nher as though he had no will of his own. Confused as his thoughts were,\\r\\nhe was, nevertheless, capable of realizing the fact that if he did not\\r\\ngo with her, she would go alone, and so he must go with her at all\\r\\nhazards. He guessed the strength of her determination; it was beyond\\r\\nhim to check it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey walked silently, and said scarcely a word all the way. He only\\r\\nnoticed that she seemed to know the road very well; and once, when he\\r\\nthought it better to go by a certain lane, and remarked to her that it\\r\\nwould be quieter and less public, she only said, â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s all the same,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nand went on.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they were almost arrived at Daria Alexeyevnaâ\\x80\\x99s house (it was a\\r\\nlarge wooden structure of ancient date), a gorgeously-dressed lady and\\r\\na young girl came out of it. Both these ladies took their seats in a\\r\\ncarriage, which was waiting at the door, talking and laughing loudly\\r\\nthe while, and drove away without appearing to notice the approaching\\r\\ncouple.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo sooner had the carriage driven off than the door opened once more;\\r\\nand Rogojin, who had apparently been awaiting them, let them in and\\r\\nclosed it after them.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere is not another soul in the house now excepting our four selves,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nhe said aloud, looking at the prince in a strange way.\\r\\n\\r\\nNastasia Philipovna was waiting for them in the first room they went\\r\\ninto. She was dressed very simply, in black.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe rose at their entrance, but did not smile or give her hand, even to\\r\\nthe prince. Her anxious eyes were fixed upon Aglaya. Both sat down, at\\r\\na little distance from one anotherâ\\x80\\x94Aglaya on the sofa, in the corner of\\r\\nthe room, Nastasia by the window. The prince and Rogojin remained\\r\\nstanding, and were not invited to sit.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuishkin glanced at Rogojin in perplexity, but the latter only smiled\\r\\ndisagreeably, and said nothing. The silence continued for some few\\r\\nmoments.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn ominous expression passed over Nastasia Philipovnaâ\\x80\\x99s face, of a\\r\\nsudden. It became obstinate-looking, hard, and full of hatred; but she\\r\\ndid not take her eyes off her visitors for a moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nAglaya was clearly confused, but not frightened. On entering she had\\r\\nmerely glanced momentarily at her rival, and then had sat still, with\\r\\nher eyes on the ground, apparently in thought. Once or twice she\\r\\nglanced casually round the room. A shade of disgust was visible in her\\r\\nexpression; she looked as though she were afraid of contamination in\\r\\nthis place.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe mechanically arranged her dress, and fidgeted uncomfortably,\\r\\neventually changing her seat to the other end of the sofa. Probably she\\r\\nwas unconscious of her own movements; but this very unconsciousness\\r\\nadded to the offensiveness of their suggested meaning.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length she looked straight into Nastasiaâ\\x80\\x99s eyes, and instantly read\\r\\nall there was to read in her rivalâ\\x80\\x99s expression. Woman understood\\r\\nwoman! Aglaya shuddered.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou know of course why I requested this meeting?â\\x80\\x9d she said at last,\\r\\nquietly, and pausing twice in the delivery of this very short sentence.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNoâ\\x80\\x94I know nothing about it,â\\x80\\x9d said Nastasia, drily and abruptly.\\r\\n\\r\\nAglaya blushed. Perhaps it struck her as very strange and impossible\\r\\nthat she should really be sitting here and waiting for â\\x80\\x9cthat womanâ\\x80\\x99sâ\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nreply to her question.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the first sound of Nastasiaâ\\x80\\x99s voice a shudder ran through her frame.\\r\\nOf course â\\x80\\x9cthat womanâ\\x80\\x9d observed and took in all this.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou know quite well, but you are pretending to be ignorant,â\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nAglaya, very low, with her eyes on the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy should I?â\\x80\\x9d asked Nastasia Philipovna, smiling slightly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou want to take advantage of my position, now that I am in your\\r\\nhouse,â\\x80\\x9d continued Aglaya, awkwardly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFor that position _you_ are to blame and not I,â\\x80\\x9d said Nastasia,\\r\\nflaring up suddenly. â\\x80\\x9c_I_ did not invite _you_, but you me; and to this\\r\\nmoment I am quite ignorant as to why I am thus honoured.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAglaya raised her head haughtily.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cRestrain your tongue!â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cI did not come here to fight you\\r\\nwith your own weapons.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh! then you did come â\\x80\\x98to fight,â\\x80\\x99 I may conclude? Dear me!â\\x80\\x94and I\\r\\nthought you were clevererâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey looked at one another with undisguised malice. One of these women\\r\\nhad written to the other, so lately, such letters as we have seen; and\\r\\nit all was dispersed at their first meeting. Yet it appeared that not\\r\\none of the four persons in the room considered this in any degree\\r\\nstrange.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince who, up to yesterday, would not have believed that he could\\r\\neven dream of such an impossible scene as this, stood and listened and\\r\\nlooked on, and felt as though he had long foreseen it all. The most\\r\\nfantastic dream seemed suddenly to have been metamorphosed into the\\r\\nmost vivid reality.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of these women so despised the other, and so longed to express her\\r\\ncontempt for her (perhaps she had only come for that very purpose, as\\r\\nRogojin said next day), that howsoever fantastical was the other woman,\\r\\nhowsoever afflicted her spirit and disturbed her understanding, no\\r\\npreconceived idea of hers could possibly stand up against that deadly\\r\\nfeminine contempt of her rival. The prince felt sure that Nastasia\\r\\nwould say nothing about the letters herself; but he could judge by her\\r\\nflashing eyes and the expression of her face what the thought of those\\r\\nletters must be costing her at this moment. He would have given half\\r\\nhis life to prevent Aglaya from speaking of them. But Aglaya suddenly\\r\\nbraced herself up, and seemed to master herself fully, all in an\\r\\ninstant.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have not quite understood,â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cI did not come to quarrel\\r\\nwith you, though I do not like you. I came to speak to you as... as one\\r\\nhuman being to another. I came with my mind made up as to what I had to\\r\\nsay to you, and I shall not change my intention, although you may\\r\\nmisunderstand me. So much the worse for you, not for myself! I wished\\r\\nto reply to all you have written to me and to reply personally, because\\r\\nI think that is the more convenient way. Listen to my reply to all your\\r\\nletters. I began to be sorry for Prince Lef Nicolaievitch on the very\\r\\nday I made his acquaintance, and when I heardâ\\x80\\x94afterwardsâ\\x80\\x94of all that\\r\\ntook place at your house in the evening, I was sorry for him because he\\r\\nwas such a simple-minded man, and because he, in the simplicity of his\\r\\nsoul, believed that he could be happy with a woman of your character.\\r\\nWhat I feared actually took place; you could not love him, you tortured\\r\\nhim, and threw him over. You could not love him because you are too\\r\\nproudâ\\x80\\x94no, not proud, that is an error; because you are too vainâ\\x80\\x94no, not\\r\\nquite that either; too self-loving; you are self-loving to madness.\\r\\nYour letters to me are a proof of it. You could not love so simple a\\r\\nsoul as his, and perhaps in your heart you despised him and laughed at\\r\\nhim. All you could love was your shame and the perpetual thought that\\r\\nyou were disgraced and insulted. If you were less shameful, or had no\\r\\ncause at all for shame, you would be still more unhappy than you are\\r\\nnow.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAglaya brought out these thronging words with great satisfaction. They\\r\\ncame from her lips hurriedly and impetuously, and had been prepared and\\r\\nthought out long ago, even before she had ever dreamed of the present\\r\\nmeeting. She watched with eagerness the effect of her speech as shown\\r\\nin Nastasiaâ\\x80\\x99s face, which was distorted with agitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou remember,â\\x80\\x9d she continued, â\\x80\\x9che wrote me a letter at that time; he\\r\\nsays you know all about that letter and that you even read it. I\\r\\nunderstand all by means of this letter, and understand it correctly. He\\r\\nhas since confirmed it all to meâ\\x80\\x94what I now say to you, word for word.\\r\\nAfter receiving his letter I waited; I guessed that you would soon come\\r\\nback here, because you could never do without Petersburg; you are still\\r\\ntoo young and lovely for the provinces. However, this is not my own\\r\\nidea,â\\x80\\x9d she added, blushing dreadfully; and from this moment the colour\\r\\nnever left her cheeks to the end of her speech. â\\x80\\x9cWhen I next saw the\\r\\nprince I began to feel terribly pained and hurt on his account. Do not\\r\\nlaugh; if you laugh you are unworthy of understanding what I say.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSurely you see that I am not laughing,â\\x80\\x9d said Nastasia, sadly and\\r\\nsternly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHowever, itâ\\x80\\x99s all the same to me; laugh or not, just as you please.\\r\\nWhen I asked him about you, he told me that he had long since ceased to\\r\\nlove you, that the very recollection of you was a torture to him, but\\r\\nthat he was sorry for you; and that when he thought of you his heart\\r\\nwas pierced. I ought to tell you that I never in my life met a man\\r\\nanything like him for noble simplicity of mind and for boundless\\r\\ntrustfulness. I guessed that anyone who liked could deceive him, and\\r\\nthat he would immediately forgive anyone who did deceive him; and it\\r\\nwas for this that I grew to love himâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAglaya paused for a moment, as though suddenly brought up in\\r\\nastonishment that she could have said these words, but at the same time\\r\\na great pride shone in her eyes, like a defiant assertion that it would\\r\\nnot matter to her if â\\x80\\x9cthis womanâ\\x80\\x9d laughed in her face for the admission\\r\\njust made.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have told you all now, and of course you understand what I wish of\\r\\nyou.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPerhaps I do; but tell me yourself,â\\x80\\x9d said Nastasia Philipovna,\\r\\nquietly.\\r\\n\\r\\nAglaya flushed up angrily.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI wished to find out from you,â\\x80\\x9d she said, firmly, â\\x80\\x9cby what right you\\r\\ndare to meddle with his feelings for me? By what right you dared send\\r\\nme those letters? By what right do you continually remind both me and\\r\\nhim that you love him, after you yourself threw him over and ran away\\r\\nfrom him in so insulting and shameful a way?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI never told either him or you that I loved him!â\\x80\\x9d replied Nastasia\\r\\nPhilipovna, with an effort. â\\x80\\x9cAndâ\\x80\\x94and I did run away from himâ\\x80\\x94you are\\r\\nright there,â\\x80\\x9d she added, scarcely audibly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNever told either him or me?â\\x80\\x9d cried Aglaya. â\\x80\\x9cHow about your letters?\\r\\nWho asked you to try to persuade me to marry him? Was not that a\\r\\ndeclaration from you? Why do you force yourself upon us in this way? I\\r\\nconfess I thought at first that you were anxious to arouse an aversion\\r\\nfor him in my heart by your meddling, in order that I might give him\\r\\nup; and it was only afterwards that I guessed the truth. You imagined\\r\\nthat you were doing an heroic action! How could you spare any love for\\r\\nhim, when you love your own vanity to such an extent? Why could you not\\r\\nsimply go away from here, instead of writing me those absurd letters?\\r\\nWhy do you not _now_ marry that generous man who loves you, and has\\r\\ndone you the honour of offering you his hand? It is plain enough why;\\r\\nif you marry Rogojin you lose your grievance; you will have nothing\\r\\nmore to complain of. You will be receiving too much honour. Evgenie\\r\\nPavlovitch was saying the other day that you had read too many poems\\r\\nand are too well educated forâ\\x80\\x94your position; and that you live in\\r\\nidleness. Add to this your vanity, and, there you have reason enoughâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd do you not live in idleness?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThings had come to this unexpected point too quickly. Unexpected\\r\\nbecause Nastasia Philipovna, on her way to Pavlofsk, had thought and\\r\\nconsidered a good deal, and had expected something different, though\\r\\nperhaps not altogether good, from this interview; but Aglaya had been\\r\\ncarried away by her own outburst, just as a rolling stone gathers\\r\\nimpetus as it careers downhill, and could not restrain herself in the\\r\\nsatisfaction of revenge.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was strange, Nastasia Philipovna felt, to see Aglaya like this. She\\r\\ngazed at her, and could hardly believe her eyes and ears for a moment\\r\\nor two.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether she were a woman who had read too many poems, as Evgenie\\r\\nPavlovitch supposed, or whether she were mad, as the prince had assured\\r\\nAglaya, at all events, this was a woman who, in spite of her\\r\\noccasionally cynical and audacious manner, was far more refined and\\r\\ntrustful and sensitive than appeared. There was a certain amount of\\r\\nromantic dreaminess and caprice in her, but with the fantastic was\\r\\nmingled much that was strong and deep.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince realized this, and great suffering expressed itself in his\\r\\nface.\\r\\n\\r\\nAglaya observed it, and trembled with anger.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow dare you speak so to me?â\\x80\\x9d she said, with a haughtiness which was\\r\\nquite indescribable, replying to Nastasiaâ\\x80\\x99s last remark.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou must have misunderstood what I said,â\\x80\\x9d said Nastasia, in some\\r\\nsurprise.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf you wished to preserve your good name, why did you not give up\\r\\nyourâ\\x80\\x94your â\\x80\\x98guardian,â\\x80\\x99 Totski, without all that theatrical posturing?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nsaid Aglaya, suddenly a propos of nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat do you know of my position, that you dare to judge me?â\\x80\\x9d cried\\r\\nNastasia, quivering with rage, and growing terribly white.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know this much, that you did not go out to honest work, but went\\r\\naway with a rich man, Rogojin, in order to pose as a fallen angel. I\\r\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t wonder that Totski was nearly driven to suicide by such a fallen\\r\\nangel.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSilence!â\\x80\\x9d cried Nastasia Philipovna. â\\x80\\x9cYou are about as fit to\\r\\nunderstand me as the housemaid here, who bore witness against her lover\\r\\nin court the other day. She would understand me better than you do.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cProbably an honest girl living by her own toil. Why do you speak of a\\r\\nhousemaid so contemptuously?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI do not despise toil; I despise you when you speak of toil.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf you had cared to be an honest woman, you would have gone out as a\\r\\nlaundress.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth had risen, and were gazing at one another with pallid faces.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAglaya, donâ\\x80\\x99t! This is unfair,â\\x80\\x9d cried the prince, deeply distressed.\\r\\n\\r\\nRogojin was not smiling now; he sat and listened with folded arms, and\\r\\nlips tight compressed.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere, look at her,â\\x80\\x9d cried Nastasia, trembling with passion. â\\x80\\x9cLook at\\r\\nthis young lady! And I imagined her an angel! Did you come to me\\r\\nwithout your governess, Aglaya Ivanovna? Oh, fie, now shall I just tell\\r\\nyou why you came here today? Shall I tell you without any\\r\\nembellishments? You came because you were afraid of me!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAfraid of _you?_â\\x80\\x9d asked Aglaya, beside herself with naive amazement\\r\\nthat the other should dare talk to her like this.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, me, of course! Of course you were afraid of me, or you would not\\r\\nhave decided to come. You cannot despise one you fear. And to think\\r\\nthat I have actually esteemed you up to this very moment! Do you know\\r\\nwhy you are afraid of me, and what is your object now? You wished to\\r\\nsatisfy yourself with your own eyes as to which he loves best, myself\\r\\nor you, because you are fearfully jealous.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe has told me already that he hates you,â\\x80\\x9d murmured Aglaya, scarcely\\r\\naudibly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPerhaps, perhaps! I am not worthy of him, I know. But I think you are\\r\\nlying, all the same. He cannot hate me, and he cannot have said so. I\\r\\nam ready to forgive you, in consideration of your position; but I\\r\\nconfess I thought better of you. I thought you were wiser, and more\\r\\nbeautiful, too; I did, indeed! Well, take your treasure! See, he is\\r\\ngazing at you, he canâ\\x80\\x99t recollect himself. Take him, but on one\\r\\ncondition; go away at once, this instant!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe fell back into a chair, and burst into tears. But suddenly some new\\r\\nexpression blazed in her eyes. She stared fixedly at Aglaya, and rose\\r\\nfrom her seat.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOr would you like me to bid him, _bid him_, do you hear, _command\\r\\nhim_, now, at once, to throw you up, and remain mine for ever? Shall I?\\r\\nHe will stay, and he will marry me too, and you shall trot home all\\r\\nalone. Shall I?â\\x80\\x94shall I say the word?â\\x80\\x9d she screamed like a madwoman,\\r\\nscarcely believing herself that she could really pronounce such wild\\r\\nwords.\\r\\n\\r\\nAglaya had made for the door in terror, but she stopped at the\\r\\nthreshold, and listened. â\\x80\\x9cShall I turn Rogojin off? Ha! ha! you thought\\r\\nI would marry him for your benefit, did you? Why, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll call out _now_,\\r\\nif you like, in your presence, â\\x80\\x98Rogojin, get out!â\\x80\\x99 and say to the\\r\\nprince, â\\x80\\x98Do you remember what you promised me?â\\x80\\x99 Heavens! what a fool I\\r\\nhave been to humiliate myself before them! Why, prince, you yourself\\r\\ngave me your word that you would marry me whatever happened, and would\\r\\nnever abandon me. You said you loved me and would forgive me all,\\r\\nandâ\\x80\\x94and respâ\\x80\\x94yes, you even said that! I only ran away from you in order\\r\\nto set you free, and now I donâ\\x80\\x99t care to let you go again. Why does she\\r\\ntreat me soâ\\x80\\x94so shamefully? I am not a loose womanâ\\x80\\x94ask Rogojin there!\\r\\nHeâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you. Will you go again now that she has insulted me, before\\r\\nyour eyes, too; turn away from me and lead her away, arm-in-arm? May\\r\\nyou be accursed too, for you were the only one I trusted among them\\r\\nall! Go away, Rogojin, I donâ\\x80\\x99t want you,â\\x80\\x9d she continued, blind with\\r\\nfury, and forcing the words out with dry lips and distorted features,\\r\\nevidently not believing a single word of her own tirade, but, at the\\r\\nsame time, doing her utmost to prolong the moment of self-deception.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe outburst was so terribly violent that the prince thought it would\\r\\nhave killed her.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere he is!â\\x80\\x9d she shrieked again, pointing to the prince and\\r\\naddressing Aglaya. â\\x80\\x9cThere he is! and if he does not approach me at once\\r\\nand take _me_ and throw you over, then have him for your ownâ\\x80\\x94I give him\\r\\nup to you! I donâ\\x80\\x99t want him!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth she and Aglaya stood and waited as though in expectation, and both\\r\\nlooked at the prince like madwomen.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he, perhaps, did not understand the full force of this challenge;\\r\\nin fact, it is certain he did not. All he could see was the poor\\r\\ndespairing face which, as he had said to Aglaya, â\\x80\\x9chad pierced his heart\\r\\nfor ever.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe could bear it no longer, and with a look of entreaty, mingled with\\r\\nreproach, he addressed Aglaya, pointing to Nastasia the while:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow can you?â\\x80\\x9d he murmured; â\\x80\\x9cshe is so unhappy.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he had no time to say another word before Aglayaâ\\x80\\x99s terrible look\\r\\nbereft him of speech. In that look was embodied so dreadful a suffering\\r\\nand so deadly a hatred, that he gave a cry and flew to her; but it was\\r\\ntoo late.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could not hold out long enough even to witness his movement in her\\r\\ndirection. She had hidden her face in her hands, cried once â\\x80\\x9cOh, my\\r\\nGod!â\\x80\\x9d and rushed out of the room. Rogojin followed her to undo the\\r\\nbolts of the door and let her out into the street.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince made a rush after her, but he was caught and held back. The\\r\\ndistorted, livid face of Nastasia gazed at him reproachfully, and her\\r\\nblue lips whispered:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat? Would you go to herâ\\x80\\x94to her?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe fell senseless into his arms.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe raised her, carried her into the room, placed her in an arm-chair,\\r\\nand stood over her, stupefied. On the table stood a tumbler of water.\\r\\nRogojin, who now returned, took this and sprinkled a little in her\\r\\nface. She opened her eyes, but for a moment she understood nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly she looked around, shuddered, gave a loud cry, and threw\\r\\nherself in the princeâ\\x80\\x99s arms.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMine, mine!â\\x80\\x9d she cried. â\\x80\\x9cHas the proud young lady gone? Ha, ha, ha!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nshe laughed hysterically. â\\x80\\x9cAnd I had given him up to her! Whyâ\\x80\\x94why did\\r\\nI? Madâ\\x80\\x94mad! Get away, Rogojin! Ha, ha, ha!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRogojin stared intently at them; then he took his hat, and without a\\r\\nword, left the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few moments later, the prince was seated by Nastasia on the sofa,\\r\\ngazing into her eyes and stroking her face and hair, as he would a\\r\\nlittle childâ\\x80\\x99s. He laughed when she laughed, and was ready to cry when\\r\\nshe cried. He did not speak, but listened to her excited, disconnected\\r\\nchatter, hardly understanding a word of it the while. No sooner did he\\r\\ndetect the slightest appearance of complaining, or weeping, or\\r\\nreproaching, than he would smile at her kindly, and begin stroking her\\r\\nhair and her cheeks, soothing and consoling her once more, as if she\\r\\nwere a child.\\r\\n\\r\\nIX.\\r\\n\\r\\nA fortnight had passed since the events recorded in the last chapter,\\r\\nand the position of the actors in our story had become so changed that\\r\\nit is almost impossible for us to continue the tale without some few\\r\\nexplanations. Yet we feel that we ought to limit ourselves to the\\r\\nsimple record of facts, without much attempt at explanation, for a very\\r\\npatent reason: because we ourselves have the greatest possible\\r\\ndifficulty in accounting for the facts to be recorded. Such a statement\\r\\non our part may appear strange to the reader. How is anyone to tell a\\r\\nstory which he cannot understand himself? In order to keep clear of a\\r\\nfalse position, we had perhaps better give an example of what we mean;\\r\\nand probably the intelligent reader will soon understand the\\r\\ndifficulty. More especially are we inclined to take this course since\\r\\nthe example will constitute a distinct march forward of our story, and\\r\\nwill not hinder the progress of the events remaining to be recorded.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the next fortnightâ\\x80\\x94that is, through the early part of Julyâ\\x80\\x94the\\r\\nhistory of our hero was circulated in the form of strange, diverting,\\r\\nmost unlikely-sounding stories, which passed from mouth to mouth,\\r\\nthrough the streets and villas adjoining those inhabited by Lebedeff,\\r\\nPtitsin, Nastasia Philipovna and the Epanchins; in fact, pretty well\\r\\nthrough the whole town and its environs. All societyâ\\x80\\x94both the\\r\\ninhabitants of the place and those who came down of an evening for the\\r\\nmusicâ\\x80\\x94had got hold of one and the same story, in a thousand varieties\\r\\nof detailâ\\x80\\x94as to how a certain young prince had raised a terrible\\r\\nscandal in a most respectable household, had thrown over a daughter of\\r\\nthe family, to whom he was engaged, and had been captured by a woman of\\r\\nshady reputation whom he was determined to marry at onceâ\\x80\\x94breaking off\\r\\nall old ties for the satisfaction of his insane idea; and, in spite of\\r\\nthe public indignation roused by his action, the marriage was to take\\r\\nplace in Pavlofsk openly and publicly, and the prince had announced his\\r\\nintention of going through with it with head erect and looking the\\r\\nwhole world in the face. The story was so artfully adorned with\\r\\nscandalous details, and persons of so great eminence and importance\\r\\nwere apparently mixed up in it, while, at the same time, the evidence\\r\\nwas so circumstantial, that it was no wonder the matter gave food for\\r\\nplenty of curiosity and gossip.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the reports of the most talented gossip-mongersâ\\x80\\x94those who,\\r\\nin every class of society, are always in haste to explain every event\\r\\nto their neighboursâ\\x80\\x94the young gentleman concerned was of good familyâ\\x80\\x94a\\r\\nprinceâ\\x80\\x94fairly richâ\\x80\\x94weak of intellect, but a democrat and a dabbler in\\r\\nthe Nihilism of the period, as exposed by Mr. Turgenieff. He could\\r\\nhardly talk Russian, but had fallen in love with one of the Miss\\r\\nEpanchins, and his suit met with so much encouragement that he had been\\r\\nreceived in the house as the recognized bridegroom-to-be of the young\\r\\nlady. But like the Frenchman of whom the story is told that he studied\\r\\nfor holy orders, took all the oaths, was ordained priest, and next\\r\\nmorning wrote to his bishop informing him that, as he did not believe\\r\\nin God and considered it wrong to deceive the people and live upon\\r\\ntheir pockets, he begged to surrender the orders conferred upon him the\\r\\nday before, and to inform his lordship that he was sending this letter\\r\\nto the public press,â\\x80\\x94like this Frenchman, the prince played a false\\r\\ngame. It was rumoured that he had purposely waited for the solemn\\r\\noccasion of a large evening party at the house of his future bride, at\\r\\nwhich he was introduced to several eminent persons, in order publicly\\r\\nto make known his ideas and opinions, and thereby insult the\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbig-wigs,â\\x80\\x9d and to throw over his bride as offensively as possible; and\\r\\nthat, resisting the servants who were told off to turn him out of the\\r\\nhouse, he had seized and thrown down a magnificent china vase. As a\\r\\ncharacteristic addition to the above, it was currently reported that\\r\\nthe young prince really loved the lady to whom he was engaged, and had\\r\\nthrown her over out of purely Nihilistic motives, with the intention of\\r\\ngiving himself the satisfaction of marrying a fallen woman in the face\\r\\nof all the world, thereby publishing his opinion that there is no\\r\\ndistinction between virtuous and disreputable women, but that all women\\r\\nare alike, free; and a â\\x80\\x9cfallenâ\\x80\\x9d woman, indeed, somewhat superior to a\\r\\nvirtuous one.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was declared that he believed in no classes or anything else,\\r\\nexcepting â\\x80\\x9cthe woman question.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this looked likely enough, and was accepted as fact by most of the\\r\\ninhabitants of the place, especially as it was borne out, more or less,\\r\\nby daily occurrences.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course much was said that could not be determined absolutely. For\\r\\ninstance, it was reported that the poor girl had so loved her future\\r\\nhusband that she had followed him to the house of the other woman, the\\r\\nday after she had been thrown over; others said that he had insisted on\\r\\nher coming, himself, in order to shame and insult her by his taunts and\\r\\nNihilistic confessions when she reached the house. However all these\\r\\nthings might be, the public interest in the matter grew daily,\\r\\nespecially as it became clear that the scandalous wedding was\\r\\nundoubtedly to take place.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo that if our readers were to ask an explanation, not of the wild\\r\\nreports about the princeâ\\x80\\x99s Nihilistic opinions, but simply as to how\\r\\nsuch a marriage could possibly satisfy his real aspirations, or as to\\r\\nthe spiritual condition of our hero at this time, we confess that we\\r\\nshould have great difficulty in giving the required information.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll we know is, that the marriage really was arranged, and that the\\r\\nprince had commissioned Lebedeff and Keller to look after all the\\r\\nnecessary business connected with it; that he had requested them to\\r\\nspare no expense; that Nastasia herself was hurrying on the wedding;\\r\\nthat Keller was to be the princeâ\\x80\\x99s best man, at his own earnest\\r\\nrequest; and that Burdovsky was to give Nastasia away, to his great\\r\\ndelight. The wedding was to take place before the middle of July.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, besides the above, we are cognizant of certain other undoubted\\r\\nfacts, which puzzle us a good deal because they seem flatly to\\r\\ncontradict the foregoing.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe suspect, for instance, that having commissioned Lebedeff and the\\r\\nothers, as above, the prince immediately forgot all about masters of\\r\\nceremonies and even the ceremony itself; and we feel quite certain that\\r\\nin making these arrangements he did so in order that he might\\r\\nabsolutely escape all thought of the wedding, and even forget its\\r\\napproach if he could, by detailing all business concerning it to\\r\\nothers.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat did he think of all this time, then? What did he wish for? There\\r\\nis no doubt that he was a perfectly free agent all through, and that as\\r\\nfar as Nastasia was concerned, there was no force of any kind brought\\r\\nto bear on him. Nastasia wished for a speedy marriage, true!â\\x80\\x94but the\\r\\nprince agreed at once to her proposals; he agreed, in fact, so casually\\r\\nthat anyone might suppose he was but acceding to the most simple and\\r\\nordinary suggestion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are many strange circumstances such as this before us; but in our\\r\\nopinion they do but deepen the mystery, and do not in the smallest\\r\\ndegree help us to understand the case.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, let us take one more example. Thus, we know for a fact that\\r\\nduring the whole of this fortnight the prince spent all his days and\\r\\nevenings with Nastasia; he walked with her, drove with her; he began to\\r\\nbe restless whenever he passed an hour without seeing herâ\\x80\\x94in fact, to\\r\\nall appearances, he sincerely loved her. He would listen to her for\\r\\nhours at a time with a quiet smile on his face, scarcely saying a word\\r\\nhimself. And yet we know, equally certainly, that during this period he\\r\\nseveral times set off, suddenly, to the Epanchinsâ\\x80\\x99, not concealing the\\r\\nfact from Nastasia Philipovna, and driving the latter to absolute\\r\\ndespair. We know also that he was not received at the Epanchinsâ\\x80\\x99 so\\r\\nlong as they remained at Pavlofsk, and that he was not allowed an\\r\\ninterview with Aglaya;â\\x80\\x94but next day he would set off once more on the\\r\\nsame errand, apparently quite oblivious of the fact of yesterdayâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nvisit having been a failure,â\\x80\\x94and, of course, meeting with another\\r\\nrefusal. We know, too, that exactly an hour after Aglaya had fled from\\r\\nNastasia Philipovnaâ\\x80\\x99s house on that fateful evening, the prince was at\\r\\nthe Epanchinsâ\\x80\\x99,â\\x80\\x94and that his appearance there had been the cause of the\\r\\ngreatest consternation and dismay; for Aglaya had not been home, and\\r\\nthe family only discovered then, for the first time, that the two of\\r\\nthem had been to Nastasiaâ\\x80\\x99s house together.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was said that Elizabetha Prokofievna and her daughters had there and\\r\\nthen denounced the prince in the strongest terms, and had refused any\\r\\nfurther acquaintance and friendship with him; their rage and\\r\\ndenunciations being redoubled when Varia Ardalionovna suddenly arrived\\r\\nand stated that Aglaya had been at her house in a terrible state of\\r\\nmind for the last hour, and that she refused to come home.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis last item of news, which disturbed Lizabetha Prokofievna more than\\r\\nanything else, was perfectly true. On leaving Nastasiaâ\\x80\\x99s, Aglaya had\\r\\nfelt that she would rather die than face her people, and had therefore\\r\\ngone straight to Nina Alexandrovnaâ\\x80\\x99s. On receiving the news, Lizabetha\\r\\nand her daughters and the general all rushed off to Aglaya, followed by\\r\\nPrince Lef Nicolaievitchâ\\x80\\x94undeterred by his recent dismissal; but\\r\\nthrough Varia he was refused a sight of Aglaya here also. The end of\\r\\nthe episode was that when Aglaya saw her mother and sisters crying over\\r\\nher and not uttering a word of reproach, she had flung herself into\\r\\ntheir arms and gone straight home with them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was said that Gania managed to make a fool of himself even on this\\r\\noccasion; for, finding himself alone with Aglaya for a minute or two\\r\\nwhen Varia had gone to the Epanchinsâ\\x80\\x99, he had thought it a fitting\\r\\nopportunity to make a declaration of his love, and on hearing this\\r\\nAglaya, in spite of her state of mind at the time, had suddenly burst\\r\\nout laughing, and had put a strange question to him. She asked him\\r\\nwhether he would consent to hold his finger to a lighted candle in\\r\\nproof of his devotion! Ganiaâ\\x80\\x94it was saidâ\\x80\\x94looked so comically bewildered\\r\\nthat Aglaya had almost laughed herself into hysterics, and had rushed\\r\\nout of the room and upstairs,â\\x80\\x94where her parents had found her.\\r\\n\\r\\nHippolyte told the prince this last story, sending for him on purpose.\\r\\nWhen Muishkin heard about the candle and Ganiaâ\\x80\\x99s finger he had laughed\\r\\nso that he had quite astonished Hippolyte,â\\x80\\x94and then shuddered and burst\\r\\ninto tears. The princeâ\\x80\\x99s condition during those days was strange and\\r\\nperturbed. Hippolyte plainly declared that he thought he was out of his\\r\\nmind;â\\x80\\x94this, however, was hardly to be relied upon.\\r\\n\\r\\nOffering all these facts to our readers and refusing to explain them,\\r\\nwe do not for a moment desire to justify our heroâ\\x80\\x99s conduct. On the\\r\\ncontrary, we are quite prepared to feel our share of the indignation\\r\\nwhich his behaviour aroused in the hearts of his friends. Even Vera\\r\\nLebedeff was angry with him for a while; so was Colia; so was Keller,\\r\\nuntil he was selected for best man; so was Lebedeff himself,â\\x80\\x94who began\\r\\nto intrigue against him out of pure irritation;â\\x80\\x94but of this anon. In\\r\\nfact we are in full accord with certain forcible words spoken to the\\r\\nprince by Evgenie Pavlovitch, quite unceremoniously, during the course\\r\\nof a friendly conversation, six or seven days after the events at\\r\\nNastasia Philipovnaâ\\x80\\x99s house.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may remark here that not only the Epanchins themselves, but all who\\r\\nhad anything to do with them, thought it right to break with the prince\\r\\nin consequence of his conduct. Prince S. even went so far as to turn\\r\\naway and cut him dead in the street. But Evgenie Pavlovitch was not\\r\\nafraid to compromise himself by paying the prince a visit, and did so,\\r\\nin spite of the fact that he had recommenced to visit at the\\r\\nEpanchinsâ\\x80\\x99, where he was received with redoubled hospitality and\\r\\nkindness after the temporary estrangement.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvgenie called upon the prince the day after that on which the\\r\\nEpanchins left Pavlofsk. He knew of all the current rumours,â\\x80\\x94in fact,\\r\\nhe had probably contributed to them himself. The prince was delighted\\r\\nto see him, and immediately began to speak of the Epanchins;â\\x80\\x94which\\r\\nsimple and straightforward opening quite took Evgenieâ\\x80\\x99s fancy, so that\\r\\nhe melted at once, and plunged _in medias res_ without ceremony.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince did not know, up to this, that the Epanchins had left the\\r\\nplace. He grew very pale on hearing the news; but a moment later he\\r\\nnodded his head, and said thoughtfully:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI knew it was bound to be so.â\\x80\\x9d Then he added quickly:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhere have they gone to?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEvgenie meanwhile observed him attentively, and the rapidity of the\\r\\nquestions, their simplicity, the princeâ\\x80\\x99s candour, and at the same\\r\\ntime, his evident perplexity and mental agitation, surprised him\\r\\nconsiderably. However, he told Muishkin all he could, kindly and in\\r\\ndetail. The prince hardly knew anything, for this was the first\\r\\ninformant from the household whom he had met since the estrangement.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvgenie reported that Aglaya had been really ill, and that for two\\r\\nnights she had not slept at all, owing to high fever; that now she was\\r\\nbetter and out of serious danger, but still in a nervous, hysterical\\r\\nstate.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a good thing that there is peace in the house, at all events,â\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\ncontinued. â\\x80\\x9cThey never utter a hint about the past, not only in\\r\\nAglayaâ\\x80\\x99s presence, but even among themselves. The old people are\\r\\ntalking of a trip abroad in the autumn, immediately after Adelaidaâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nwedding; Aglaya received the news in silence.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEvgenie himself was very likely going abroad also; so were Prince S.\\r\\nand his wife, if affairs allowed of it; the general was to stay at\\r\\nhome. They were all at their estate of Colmina now, about twenty miles\\r\\nor so from St. Petersburg. Princess Bielokonski had not returned to\\r\\nMoscow yet, and was apparently staying on for reasons of her own.\\r\\nLizabetha Prokofievna had insisted that it was quite impossible to\\r\\nremain in Pavlofsk after what had happened. Evgenie had told her of all\\r\\nthe rumours current in town about the affair; so that there could be no\\r\\ntalk of their going to their house on the Yelagin as yet.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd in point of fact, prince,â\\x80\\x9d added Evgenie Pavlovitch, â\\x80\\x9cyou must\\r\\nallow that they could hardly have stayed here, considering that they\\r\\nknew of all that went on at your place, and in the face of your daily\\r\\nvisits to their house, visits which you insisted upon making in spite\\r\\nof their refusal to see you.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYesâ\\x80\\x94yes, quite so; you are quite right. I wished to see Aglaya\\r\\nIvanovna, you know!â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, nodding his head.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, my dear fellow,â\\x80\\x9d cried Evgenie, warmly, with real sorrow in his\\r\\nvoice, â\\x80\\x9chow could you permit all that to come about as it has? Of\\r\\ncourse, of course, I know it was all so unexpected. I admit that you,\\r\\nonly naturally, lost your head, andâ\\x80\\x94and could not stop the foolish\\r\\ngirl; that was not in your power. I quite see so much; but you really\\r\\nshould have understood how seriously she cared for you. She could not\\r\\nbear to share you with another; and you could bring yourself to throw\\r\\naway and shatter such a treasure! Oh, prince, prince!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, yes, you are quite right again,â\\x80\\x9d said the poor prince, in anguish\\r\\nof mind. â\\x80\\x9cI was wrong, I know. But it was only Aglaya who looked on\\r\\nNastasia Philipovna so; no one else did, you know.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut thatâ\\x80\\x99s just the worst of it all, donâ\\x80\\x99t you see, that there was\\r\\nabsolutely nothing serious about the matter in reality!â\\x80\\x9d cried Evgenie,\\r\\nbeside himself: â\\x80\\x9cExcuse me, prince, but I have thought over all this; I\\r\\nhave thought a great deal over it; I know all that had happened before;\\r\\nI know all that took place six months since; and I know there was\\r\\n_nothing_ serious about the matter, it was but fancy, smoke, fantasy,\\r\\ndistorted by agitation, and only the alarmed jealousy of an absolutely\\r\\ninexperienced girl could possibly have mistaken it for serious\\r\\nreality.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Evgenie Pavlovitch quite let himself go, and gave the reins to his\\r\\nindignation.\\r\\n\\r\\nClearly and reasonably, and with great psychological insight, he drew a\\r\\npicture of the princeâ\\x80\\x99s past relations with Nastasia Philipovna.\\r\\nEvgenie Pavlovitch always had a ready tongue, but on this occasion his\\r\\neloquence, surprised himself. â\\x80\\x9cFrom the very beginning,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cyou\\r\\nbegan with a lie; what began with a lie was bound to end with a lie;\\r\\nsuch is the law of nature. I do not agree, in fact I am angry, when I\\r\\nhear you called an idiot; you are far too intelligent to deserve such\\r\\nan epithet; but you are so far _strange_ as to be unlike others; that\\r\\nyou must allow, yourself. Now, I have come to the conclusion that the\\r\\nbasis of all that has happened, has been first of all your innate\\r\\ninexperience (remark the expression â\\x80\\x98innate,â\\x80\\x99 prince). Then follows\\r\\nyour unheard-of simplicity of heart; then comes your absolute want of\\r\\nsense of proportion (to this want you have several times confessed);\\r\\nand lastly, a mass, an accumulation, of intellectual convictions which\\r\\nyou, in your unexampled honesty of soul, accept unquestionably as also\\r\\ninnate and natural and true. Admit, prince, that in your relations with\\r\\nNastasia Philipovna there has existed, from the very first, something\\r\\ndemocratic, and the fascination, so to speak, of the â\\x80\\x98woman questionâ\\x80\\x99?\\r\\nI know all about that scandalous scene at Nastasia Philipovnaâ\\x80\\x99s house\\r\\nwhen Rogojin brought the money, six months ago. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll show you yourself\\r\\nas in a looking-glass, if you like. I know exactly all that went on, in\\r\\nevery detail, and why things have turned out as they have. You\\r\\nthirsted, while in Switzerland, for your home-country, for Russia; you\\r\\nread, doubtless, many books about Russia, excellent books, I dare say,\\r\\nbut hurtful to _you_; and you arrived here; as it were, on fire with\\r\\nthe longing to be of service. Then, on the very day of your arrival,\\r\\nthey tell you a sad story of an ill-used woman; they tell _you_, a\\r\\nknight, pure and without reproach, this tale of a poor woman! The same\\r\\nday you actually _see_ her; you are attracted by her beauty, her\\r\\nfantastic, almost demoniacal, beautyâ\\x80\\x94(I admit her beauty, of course).\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAdd to all this your nervous nature, your epilepsy, and your sudden\\r\\narrival in a strange townâ\\x80\\x94the day of meetings and of exciting scenes,\\r\\nthe day of unexpected acquaintanceships, the day of sudden actions, the\\r\\nday of meeting with the three lovely Epanchin girls, and among them\\r\\nAglayaâ\\x80\\x94add your fatigue, your excitement; add Nastasiaâ\\x80\\x99 s evening\\r\\nparty, and the tone of that party, andâ\\x80\\x94what were you to expect of\\r\\nyourself at such a moment as that?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, yes, yes!â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, once more, nodding his head, and\\r\\nblushing slightly. â\\x80\\x9cYes, it was so, or nearly soâ\\x80\\x94I know it. And\\r\\nbesides, you see, I had not slept the night before, in the train, or\\r\\nthe night before that, either, and I was very tired.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course, of course, quite so; thatâ\\x80\\x99s what I am driving at!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\ncontinued Evgenie, excitedly. â\\x80\\x9cIt is as clear as possible, and most\\r\\ncomprehensible, that you, in your enthusiasm, should plunge headlong\\r\\ninto the first chance that came of publicly airing your great idea that\\r\\nyou, a prince, and a pure-living man, did not consider a woman\\r\\ndisgraced if the sin were not her own, but that of a disgusting social\\r\\nlibertine! Oh, heavens! itâ\\x80\\x99s comprehensible enough, my dear prince, but\\r\\nthat is not the question, unfortunately! The question is, was there any\\r\\nreality and truth in your feelings? Was it nature, or nothing but\\r\\nintellectual enthusiasm? What do you think yourself? We are told, of\\r\\ncourse, that a far worse woman was _forgiven_, but we donâ\\x80\\x99t find that\\r\\nshe was told that she had done well, or that she was worthy of honour\\r\\nand respect! Did not your common-sense show you what was the real state\\r\\nof the case, a few months later? The question is now, not whether she\\r\\nis an innocent woman (I do not insist one way or the otherâ\\x80\\x94I do not\\r\\nwish to); but can her whole career justify such intolerable pride, such\\r\\ninsolent, rapacious egotism as she has shown? Forgive me, I am too\\r\\nviolent, perhaps, butâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYesâ\\x80\\x94I dare say it is all as you say; I dare say you are quite right,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nmuttered the prince once more. â\\x80\\x9cShe is very sensitive and easily put\\r\\nout, of course; but still, she...â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe is worthy of sympathy? Is that what you wished to say, my good\\r\\nfellow? But then, for the mere sake of vindicating her worthiness of\\r\\nsympathy, you should not have insulted and offended a noble and\\r\\ngenerous girl in her presence! This is a terrible exaggeration of\\r\\nsympathy! How can you love a girl, and yet so humiliate her as to throw\\r\\nher over for the sake of another woman, before the very eyes of that\\r\\nother woman, when you have already made her a formal proposal of\\r\\nmarriage? And you _did_ propose to her, you know; you did so before her\\r\\nparents and sisters. Can you be an honest man, prince, if you act so? I\\r\\nask you! And did you not deceive that beautiful girl when you assured\\r\\nher of your love?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, you are quite right. Oh! I feel that I am very guilty!â\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nMuishkin, in deepest distress.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut as if that is enough!â\\x80\\x9d cried Evgenie, indignantly. â\\x80\\x9cAs if it is\\r\\nenough simply to say: â\\x80\\x98I know I am very guilty!â\\x80\\x99 You are to blame, and\\r\\nyet you persevere in evil-doing. Where was your heart, I should like to\\r\\nknow, your _christian heart_, all that time? Did she look as though she\\r\\nwere suffering less, at that moment? You saw her faceâ\\x80\\x94was she suffering\\r\\nless than the other woman? How could you see her suffering and allow it\\r\\nto continue? How could you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut I did not allow it,â\\x80\\x9d murmured the wretched prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHowâ\\x80\\x94what do you mean you didnâ\\x80\\x99t allow?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cUpon my word, I didnâ\\x80\\x99t! To this moment I donâ\\x80\\x99t know how it all\\r\\nhappened. Iâ\\x80\\x94I ran after Aglaya Ivanovna, but Nastasia Philipovna fell\\r\\ndown in a faint; and since that day they wonâ\\x80\\x99t let me see Aglayaâ\\x80\\x94thatâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nall I know.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s all the same; you ought to have run after Aglaya though the other\\r\\nwas fainting.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, yes, I oughtâ\\x80\\x94but I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t! She would have diedâ\\x80\\x94she would have\\r\\nkilled herself. You donâ\\x80\\x99t know her; and I should have told Aglaya\\r\\neverything afterwardsâ\\x80\\x94but I see, Evgenie Pavlovitch, you donâ\\x80\\x99t know\\r\\nall. Tell me now, why am I not allowed to see Aglaya? I should have\\r\\ncleared it all up, you know. Neither of them kept to the real point,\\r\\nyou see. I could never explain what I mean to you, but I think I could\\r\\nto Aglaya. Oh! my God, my God! You spoke just now of Aglayaâ\\x80\\x99s face at\\r\\nthe moment when she ran away. Oh, my God! I remember it! Come along,\\r\\ncome alongâ\\x80\\x94quick!â\\x80\\x9d He pulled at Evgenieâ\\x80\\x99s coat-sleeve nervously and\\r\\nexcitedly, and rose from his chair.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhere to?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome to Aglayaâ\\x80\\x94quick, quick!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut I told you she is not at Pavlofsk. And what would be the use if\\r\\nshe were?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, sheâ\\x80\\x99ll understand, sheâ\\x80\\x99ll understand!â\\x80\\x9d cried the prince, clasping\\r\\nhis hands. â\\x80\\x9cShe would understand that all this is not the pointâ\\x80\\x94not a\\r\\nbit the real pointâ\\x80\\x94it is quite foreign to the real question.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow can it be foreign? You _are_ going to be married, are you not?\\r\\nVery well, then you are persisting in your course. _Are_ you going to\\r\\nmarry her or not?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I shall marry herâ\\x80\\x94yes.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen why is it â\\x80\\x98not the pointâ\\x80\\x99?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, no, it is not the point, not a bit. It makes no difference, my\\r\\nmarrying herâ\\x80\\x94it means nothing.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow â\\x80\\x98means nothingâ\\x80\\x99? You are talking nonsense, my friend. You are\\r\\nmarrying the woman you love in order to secure her happiness, and\\r\\nAglaya sees and knows it. How can you say that itâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x98not the pointâ\\x80\\x99?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHer happiness? Oh, no! I am only marrying herâ\\x80\\x94well, because she wished\\r\\nit. It means nothingâ\\x80\\x94itâ\\x80\\x99s all the same. She would certainly have died.\\r\\nI see now that that marriage with Rogojin was an insane idea. I\\r\\nunderstand all now that I did not understand before; and, do you know,\\r\\nwhen those two stood opposite to one another, I could not bear Nastasia\\r\\nPhilipovnaâ\\x80\\x99s face! You must know, Evgenie Pavlovitch, I have never told\\r\\nanyone beforeâ\\x80\\x94not even Aglayaâ\\x80\\x94that I cannot bear Nastasia Philipovnaâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nface.â\\x80\\x9d (He lowered his voice mysteriously as he said this.) â\\x80\\x9cYou\\r\\ndescribed that evening at Nastasia Philipovnaâ\\x80\\x99s (six months since) very\\r\\naccurately just now; but there is one thing which you did not mention,\\r\\nand of which you took no account, because you do not know. I mean her\\r\\n_face_â\\x80\\x94I looked at her face, you see. Even in the morning when I saw\\r\\nher portrait, I felt that I could not _bear_ to look at it. Now,\\r\\nthereâ\\x80\\x99s Vera Lebedeff, for instance, her eyes are quite different, you\\r\\nknow. Iâ\\x80\\x99m _afraid_ of her face!â\\x80\\x9d he added, with real alarm.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are _afraid_ of it?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYesâ\\x80\\x94sheâ\\x80\\x99s mad!â\\x80\\x9d he whispered, growing pale.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you know this for certain?â\\x80\\x9d asked Evgenie, with the greatest\\r\\ncuriosity.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, for certainâ\\x80\\x94quite for certain, now! I have discovered it\\r\\n_absolutely_ for certain, these last few days.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat are you doing, then?â\\x80\\x9d cried Evgenie, in horror. â\\x80\\x9cYou must be\\r\\nmarrying her solely out of _fear_, then! I canâ\\x80\\x99t make head or tail of\\r\\nit, prince. Perhaps you donâ\\x80\\x99t even love her?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, no; I love her with all my soul. Why, she is a child! Sheâ\\x80\\x99s a\\r\\nchild nowâ\\x80\\x94a real child. Oh! you know nothing about it at all, I see.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd are you assured, at the same time, that you love Aglaya too?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYesâ\\x80\\x94yesâ\\x80\\x94oh; yes!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow so? Do you want to make out that you love them _both?_â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYesâ\\x80\\x94yesâ\\x80\\x94both! I do!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExcuse me, prince, but think what you are saying! Recollect yourself!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWithout Aglayaâ\\x80\\x94Iâ\\x80\\x94I _must_ see Aglaya!â\\x80\\x94I shall die in my sleep very\\r\\nsoonâ\\x80\\x94I thought I was dying in my sleep last night. Oh! if Aglaya only\\r\\nknew allâ\\x80\\x94I mean really, _really_ all! Because she must know\\r\\n_all_â\\x80\\x94thatâ\\x80\\x99s the first condition towards understanding. Why cannot we\\r\\never know all about another, especially when that other has been\\r\\nguilty? But I donâ\\x80\\x99t know what Iâ\\x80\\x99m talking aboutâ\\x80\\x94Iâ\\x80\\x99m so confused. You\\r\\npained me so dreadfully. Surelyâ\\x80\\x94surely Aglaya has not the same\\r\\nexpression now as she had at the moment when she ran away? Oh, yes! I\\r\\nam guilty and I know itâ\\x80\\x94I know it! Probably I am in fault all roundâ\\x80\\x94I\\r\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t quite know howâ\\x80\\x94but I am in fault, no doubt. There is something\\r\\nelse, but I cannot explain it to you, Evgenie Pavlovitch. I have no\\r\\nwords; but Aglaya will understand. I have always believed Aglaya will\\r\\nunderstandâ\\x80\\x94I am assured she will.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, prince, she will not. Aglaya loved like a woman, like a human\\r\\nbeing, not like an abstract spirit. Do you know what, my poor prince?\\r\\nThe most probable explanation of the matter is that you never loved\\r\\neither the one or the other in reality.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t knowâ\\x80\\x94perhaps you are right in much that you have said, Evgenie\\r\\nPavlovitch. You are very wise, Evgenie Pavlovitchâ\\x80\\x94oh! how my head is\\r\\nbeginning to ache again! Come to her, quickâ\\x80\\x94for Godâ\\x80\\x99s sake, come!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut I tell you she is not in Pavlofsk! Sheâ\\x80\\x99s in Colmina.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, come to Colmina, then! Comeâ\\x80\\x94let us go at once!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNoâ\\x80\\x94no, impossible!â\\x80\\x9d said Evgenie, rising.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLook hereâ\\x80\\x94Iâ\\x80\\x99ll write a letterâ\\x80\\x94take a letter for me!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNoâ\\x80\\x94no, prince; you must forgive me, but I canâ\\x80\\x99t undertake any such\\r\\ncommissions! I really canâ\\x80\\x99t.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so they parted.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvgenie Pavlovitch left the house with strange convictions. He, too,\\r\\nfelt that the prince must be out of his mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd what did he mean by that _face_â\\x80\\x94a face which he so fears, and yet\\r\\nso loves? And meanwhile he really may die, as he says, without seeing\\r\\nAglaya, and she will never know how devotedly he loves her! Ha, ha, ha!\\r\\nHow does the fellow manage to love two of them? Two different kinds of\\r\\nlove, I suppose! This is very interestingâ\\x80\\x94poor idiot! What on earth\\r\\nwill become of him now?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nX.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince did not die before his weddingâ\\x80\\x94either by day or night, as he\\r\\nhad foretold that he might. Very probably he passed disturbed nights,\\r\\nand was afflicted with bad dreams; but, during the daytime, among his\\r\\nfellow-men, he seemed as kind as ever, and even contented; only a\\r\\nlittle thoughtful when alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wedding was hurried on. The day was fixed for exactly a week after\\r\\nEvgenieâ\\x80\\x99s visit to the prince. In the face of such haste as this, even\\r\\nthe princeâ\\x80\\x99s best friends (if he had had any) would have felt the\\r\\nhopelessness of any attempt to save â\\x80\\x9cthe poor madman.â\\x80\\x9d Rumour said that\\r\\nin the visit of Evgenie Pavlovitch was to be discerned the influence of\\r\\nLizabetha Prokofievna and her husband... But if those good souls, in\\r\\nthe boundless kindness of their hearts, were desirous of saving the\\r\\neccentric young fellow from ruin, they were unable to take any stronger\\r\\nmeasures to attain that end. Neither their position, nor their private\\r\\ninclination, perhaps (and only naturally), would allow them to use any\\r\\nmore pronounced means.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have observed before that even some of the princeâ\\x80\\x99s nearest\\r\\nneighbours had begun to oppose him. Vera Lebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s passive\\r\\ndisagreement was limited to the shedding of a few solitary tears; to\\r\\nmore frequent sitting alone at home, and to a diminished frequency in\\r\\nher visits to the princeâ\\x80\\x99s apartments.\\r\\n\\r\\nColia was occupied with his father at this time. The old man died\\r\\nduring a second stroke, which took place just eight days after the\\r\\nfirst. The prince showed great sympathy in the grief of the family, and\\r\\nduring the first days of their mourning he was at the house a great\\r\\ndeal with Nina Alexandrovna. He went to the funeral, and it was\\r\\nobservable that the public assembled in church greeted his arrival and\\r\\ndeparture with whisperings, and watched him closely.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same thing happened in the park and in the street, wherever he\\r\\nwent. He was pointed out when he drove by, and he often overheard the\\r\\nname of Nastasia Philipovna coupled with his own as he passed. People\\r\\nlooked out for her at the funeral, too, but she was not there; and\\r\\nanother conspicuous absentee was the captainâ\\x80\\x99s widow, whom Lebedeff had\\r\\nprevented from coming.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe funeral service produced a great effect on the prince. He whispered\\r\\nto Lebedeff that this was the first time he had ever heard a Russian\\r\\nfuneral service since he was a little boy. Observing that he was\\r\\nlooking about him uneasily, Lebedeff asked him whom he was seeking.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNothing. I only thought Iâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs it Rogojin?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhyâ\\x80\\x94is he here?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, heâ\\x80\\x99s in church.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI thought I caught sight of his eyes!â\\x80\\x9d muttered the prince, in\\r\\nconfusion. â\\x80\\x9cBut what of it!â\\x80\\x94Why is he here? Was he asked?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, dear, no! Why, they donâ\\x80\\x99t even know him! Anyone can come in, you\\r\\nknow. Why do you look so amazed? I often meet him; Iâ\\x80\\x99ve seen him at\\r\\nleast four times, here at Pavlofsk, within the last week.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI havenâ\\x80\\x99t seen him onceâ\\x80\\x94since that day!â\\x80\\x9d the prince murmured.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Nastasia Philipovna had not said a word about having met Rogojin\\r\\nsince â\\x80\\x9cthat day,â\\x80\\x9d the prince concluded that the latter had his own\\r\\nreasons for wishing to keep out of sight. All the day of the funeral\\r\\nour hero was in a deeply thoughtful state, while Nastasia Philipovna\\r\\nwas particularly merry, both in the daytime and in the evening.\\r\\n\\r\\nColia had made it up with the prince before his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s death, and it\\r\\nwas he who urged him to make use of Keller and Burdovsky, promising to\\r\\nanswer himself for the formerâ\\x80\\x99s behaviour. Nina Alexandrovna and\\r\\nLebedeff tried to persuade him to have the wedding in St. Petersburg,\\r\\ninstead of in the public fashion contemplated, down here at Pavlofsk in\\r\\nthe height of the season. But the prince only said that Nastasia\\r\\nPhilipovna desired to have it so, though he saw well enough what\\r\\nprompted their arguments.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day Keller came to visit the prince. He was in a high state of\\r\\ndelight with the post of honour assigned to him at the wedding.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore entering he stopped on the threshold, raised his hand as if\\r\\nmaking a solemn vow, and cried:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI wonâ\\x80\\x99t drink!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he went up to the prince, seized both his hands, shook them\\r\\nwarmly, and declared that he had at first felt hostile towards the\\r\\nproject of this marriage, and had openly said so in the billiard-rooms,\\r\\nbut that the reason simply was that, with the impatience of a friend,\\r\\nhe had hoped to see the prince marry at least a Princess de Rohan or de\\r\\nChabot; but that now he saw that the princeâ\\x80\\x99s way of thinking was ten\\r\\ntimes more noble than that of â\\x80\\x9call the rest put together.â\\x80\\x9d For he\\r\\ndesired neither pomp nor wealth nor honour, but only the truth! The\\r\\nsympathies of exalted personages were well known, and the prince was\\r\\ntoo highly placed by his education, and so on, not to be in some sense\\r\\nan exalted personage!\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut all the common herd judge differently; in the town, at the\\r\\nmeetings, in the villas, at the band, in the inns and the\\r\\nbilliard-rooms, the coming event has only to be mentioned and there are\\r\\nshouts and cries from everybody. I have even heard talk of getting up a\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98charivariâ\\x80\\x99 under the windows on the wedding-night. So if â\\x80\\x98you have\\r\\nneed of the pistolâ\\x80\\x99 of an honest man, prince, I am ready to fire half a\\r\\ndozen shots even before you rise from your nuptial couch!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nKeller also advised, in anticipation of the crowd making a rush after\\r\\nthe ceremony, that a fire-hose should be placed at the entrance to the\\r\\nhouse; but Lebedeff was opposed to this measure, which he said might\\r\\nresult in the place being pulled down.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI assure you, prince, that Lebedeff is intriguing against you. He\\r\\nwants to put you under control. Imagine that! To take â\\x80\\x98from you the use\\r\\nof your free-will and your moneyâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x94that is to say, the two things that\\r\\ndistinguish us from the animals! I have heard it said positively. It is\\r\\nthe sober truth.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince recollected that somebody had told him something of the kind\\r\\nbefore, and he had, of course, scoffed at it. He only laughed now, and\\r\\nforgot the hint at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nLebedeff really had been busy for some little while; but, as usual, his\\r\\nplans had become too complex to succeed, through sheer excess of\\r\\nardour. When he came to the princeâ\\x80\\x94the very day before the weddingâ\\x80\\x94to\\r\\nconfess (for he always confessed to the persons against whom he\\r\\nintrigued, especially when the plan failed), he informed our hero that\\r\\nhe himself was a born Talleyrand, but for some unknown reason had\\r\\nbecome simple Lebedeff. He then proceeded to explain his whole game to\\r\\nthe prince, interesting the latter exceedingly.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Lebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s account, he had first tried what he could do\\r\\nwith General Epanchin. The latter informed him that he wished well to\\r\\nthe unfortunate young man, and would gladly do what he could to â\\x80\\x9csave\\r\\nhim,â\\x80\\x9d but that he did not think it would be seemly for him to interfere\\r\\nin this matter. Lizabetha Prokofievna would neither hear nor see him.\\r\\nPrince S. and Evgenie Pavlovitch only shrugged their shoulders, and\\r\\nimplied that it was no business of theirs. However, Lebedeff had not\\r\\nlost heart, and went off to a clever lawyer,â\\x80\\x94a worthy and respectable\\r\\nman, whom he knew well. This old gentleman informed him that the thing\\r\\nwas perfectly feasible if he could get hold of competent witnesses as\\r\\nto Muishkinâ\\x80\\x99s mental incapacity. Then, with the assistance of a few\\r\\ninfluential persons, he would soon see the matter arranged.\\r\\n\\r\\nLebedeff immediately procured the services of an old doctor, and\\r\\ncarried the latter away to Pavlofsk to see the prince, by way of\\r\\nviewing the ground, as it were, and to give him (Lebedeff) counsel as\\r\\nto whether the thing was to be done or not. The visit was not to be\\r\\nofficial, but merely friendly.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuishkin remembered the doctorâ\\x80\\x99s visit quite well. He remembered that\\r\\nLebedeff had said that he looked ill, and had better see a doctor; and\\r\\nalthough the prince scouted the idea, Lebedeff had turned up almost\\r\\nimmediately with his old friend, explaining that they had just met at\\r\\nthe bedside of Hippolyte, who was very ill, and that the doctor had\\r\\nsomething to tell the prince about the sick man.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince had, of course, at once received him, and had plunged into a\\r\\nconversation about Hippolyte. He had given the doctor an account of\\r\\nHippolyteâ\\x80\\x99s attempted suicide; and had proceeded thereafter to talk of\\r\\nhis own malady,â\\x80\\x94of Switzerland, of Schneider, and so on; and so deeply\\r\\nwas the old man interested by the princeâ\\x80\\x99s conversation and his\\r\\ndescription of Schneiderâ\\x80\\x99s system, that he sat on for two hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuishkin gave him excellent cigars to smoke, and Lebedeff, for his\\r\\npart, regaled him with liqueurs, brought in by Vera, to whom the\\r\\ndoctorâ\\x80\\x94a married man and the father of a familyâ\\x80\\x94addressed such\\r\\ncompliments that she was filled with indignation. They parted friends,\\r\\nand, after leaving the prince, the doctor said to Lebedeff: â\\x80\\x9cIf all\\r\\nsuch people were put under restraint, there would be no one left for\\r\\nkeepers.â\\x80\\x9d Lebedeff then, in tragic tones, told of the approaching\\r\\nmarriage, whereupon the other nodded his head and replied that, after\\r\\nall, marriages like that were not so rare; that he had heard that the\\r\\nlady was very fascinating and of extraordinary beauty, which was enough\\r\\nto explain the infatuation of a wealthy man; that, further, thanks to\\r\\nthe liberality of Totski and of Rogojin, she possessedâ\\x80\\x94so he had\\r\\nheardâ\\x80\\x94not only money, but pearls, diamonds, shawls, and furniture, and\\r\\nconsequently she could not be considered a bad match. In brief, it\\r\\nseemed to the doctor that the princeâ\\x80\\x99s choice, far from being a sign of\\r\\nfoolishness, denoted, on the contrary, a shrewd, calculating, and\\r\\npractical mind. Lebedeff had been much struck by this point of view,\\r\\nand he terminated his confession by assuring the prince that he was\\r\\nready, if need be, to shed his very lifeâ\\x80\\x99s blood for him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHippolyte, too, was a source of some distraction to the prince at this\\r\\ntime; he would send for him at any and every hour of the day. They\\r\\nlived,â\\x80\\x94Hippolyte and his mother and the children,â\\x80\\x94in a small house not\\r\\nfar off, and the little ones were happy, if only because they were able\\r\\nto escape from the invalid into the garden. The prince had enough to do\\r\\nin keeping the peace between the irritable Hippolyte and his mother,\\r\\nand eventually the former became so malicious and sarcastic on the\\r\\nsubject of the approaching wedding, that Muishkin took offence at last,\\r\\nand refused to continue his visits.\\r\\n\\r\\nA couple of days later, however, Hippolyteâ\\x80\\x99s mother came with tears in\\r\\nher eyes, and begged the prince to come back, â\\x80\\x9cor _he_ would eat her up\\r\\nbodily.â\\x80\\x9d She added that Hippolyte had a great secret to disclose. Of\\r\\ncourse the prince went. There was no secret, however, unless we reckon\\r\\ncertain pantings and agitated glances around (probably all put on) as\\r\\nthe invalid begged his visitor to â\\x80\\x9cbeware of Rogojin.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe is the sort of man,â\\x80\\x9d he continued, â\\x80\\x9cwho wonâ\\x80\\x99t give up his object,\\r\\nyou know; he is not like you and me, princeâ\\x80\\x94he belongs to quite a\\r\\ndifferent order of beings. If he sets his heart on a thing he wonâ\\x80\\x99t be\\r\\nafraid of anythingâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d and so on.\\r\\n\\r\\nHippolyte was very ill, and looked as though he could not long survive.\\r\\nHe was tearful at first, but grew more and more sarcastic and malicious\\r\\nas the interview proceeded.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince questioned him in detail as to his hints about Rogojin. He\\r\\nwas anxious to seize upon some facts which might confirm Hippolyteâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nvague warnings; but there were none; only Hippolyteâ\\x80\\x99s own private\\r\\nimpressions and feelings.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the invalidâ\\x80\\x94to his immense satisfactionâ\\x80\\x94ended by seriously\\r\\nalarming the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first Muishkin had not cared to make any reply to his sundry\\r\\nquestions, and only smiled in response to Hippolyteâ\\x80\\x99s advice to â\\x80\\x9crun\\r\\nfor his lifeâ\\x80\\x94abroad, if necessary. There are Russian priests\\r\\neverywhere, and one can get married all over the world.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it was Hippolyteâ\\x80\\x99s last idea which upset him.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat I am really alarmed about, though,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cis Aglaya Ivanovna.\\r\\nRogojin knows how you love her. Love for love. You took Nastasia\\r\\nPhilipovna from him. He will murder Aglaya Ivanovna; for though she is\\r\\nnot yours, of course, now, still such an act would pain you,â\\x80\\x94wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nit?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had attained his end. The prince left the house beside himself with\\r\\nterror.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese warnings about Rogojin were expressed on the day before the\\r\\nwedding. That evening the prince saw Nastasia Philipovna for the last\\r\\ntime before they were to meet at the altar; but Nastasia was not in a\\r\\nposition to give him any comfort or consolation. On the contrary, she\\r\\nonly added to his mental perturbation as the evening went on. Up to\\r\\nthis time she had invariably done her best to cheer himâ\\x80\\x94she was afraid\\r\\nof his looking melancholy; she would try singing to him, and telling\\r\\nhim every sort of funny story or reminiscence that she could recall.\\r\\nThe prince nearly always pretended to be amused, whether he were so\\r\\nactually or no; but often enough he laughed sincerely, delighted by the\\r\\nbrilliancy of her wit when she was carried away by her narrative, as\\r\\nshe very often was. Nastasia would be wild with joy to see the\\r\\nimpression she had made, and to hear his laugh of real amusement; and\\r\\nshe would remain the whole evening in a state of pride and happiness.\\r\\nBut this evening her melancholy and thoughtfulness grew with every\\r\\nhour.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince had told Evgenie Pavlovitch with perfect sincerity that he\\r\\nloved Nastasia Philipovna with all his soul. In his love for her there\\r\\nwas the sort of tenderness one feels for a sick, unhappy child which\\r\\ncannot be left alone. He never spoke of his feelings for Nastasia to\\r\\nanyone, not even to herself. When they were together they never\\r\\ndiscussed their â\\x80\\x9cfeelings,â\\x80\\x9d and there was nothing in their cheerful,\\r\\nanimated conversation which an outsider could not have heard. Daria\\r\\nAlexeyevna, with whom Nastasia was staying, told afterwards how she had\\r\\nbeen filled with joy and delight only to look at them, all this time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks to the manner in which he regarded Nastasiaâ\\x80\\x99s mental and moral\\r\\ncondition, the prince was to some extent freed from other perplexities.\\r\\nShe was now quite different from the woman he had known three months\\r\\nbefore. He was not astonished, for instance, to see her now so\\r\\nimpatient to marry himâ\\x80\\x94she who formerly had wept with rage and hurled\\r\\ncurses and reproaches at him if he mentioned marriage! â\\x80\\x9cIt shows that\\r\\nshe no longer fears, as she did then, that she would make me unhappy by\\r\\nmarrying me,â\\x80\\x9d he thought. And he felt sure that so sudden a change\\r\\ncould not be a natural one. This rapid growth of self-confidence could\\r\\nnot be due only to her hatred for Aglaya. To suppose that would be to\\r\\nsuspect the depth of her feelings. Nor could it arise from dread of the\\r\\nfate that awaited her if she married Rogojin. These causes, indeed, as\\r\\nwell as others, might have played a part in it, but the true reason,\\r\\nMuishkin decided, was the one he had long suspectedâ\\x80\\x94that the poor sick\\r\\nsoul had come to the end of its forces. Yet this was an explanation\\r\\nthat did not procure him any peace of mind. At times he seemed to be\\r\\nmaking violent efforts to think of nothing, and one would have said\\r\\nthat he looked on his marriage as an unimportant formality, and on his\\r\\nfuture happiness as a thing not worth considering. As to conversations\\r\\nsuch as the one held with Evgenie Pavlovitch, he avoided them as far as\\r\\npossible, feeling that there were certain objections to which he could\\r\\nmake no answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince had observed that Nastasia knew well enough what Aglaya was\\r\\nto him. He never spoke of it, but he had seen her face when she had\\r\\ncaught him starting off for the Epanchinsâ\\x80\\x99 house on several occasions.\\r\\nWhen the Epanchins left Pavlofsk, she had beamed with radiance and\\r\\nhappiness. Unsuspicious and unobservant as he was, he had feared at\\r\\nthat time that Nastasia might have some scheme in her mind for a scene\\r\\nor scandal which would drive Aglaya out of Pavlofsk. She had encouraged\\r\\nthe rumours and excitement among the inhabitants of the place as to her\\r\\nmarriage with the prince, in order to annoy her rival; and, finding it\\r\\ndifficult to meet the Epanchins anywhere, she had, on one occasion,\\r\\ntaken him for a drive past their house. He did not observe what was\\r\\nhappening until they were almost passing the windows, when it was too\\r\\nlate to do anything. He said nothing, but for two days afterwards he\\r\\nwas ill.\\r\\n\\r\\nNastasia did not try that particular experiment again. A few days\\r\\nbefore that fixed for the wedding, she grew grave and thoughtful. She\\r\\nalways ended by getting the better of her melancholy, and becoming\\r\\nmerry and cheerful again, but not quite so unaffectedly happy as she\\r\\nhad been some days earlier.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince redoubled his attentive study of her symptoms. It was a most\\r\\ncurious circumstance, in his opinion, that she never spoke of Rogojin.\\r\\nBut once, about five days before the wedding, when the prince was at\\r\\nhome, a messenger arrived begging him to come at once, as Nastasia\\r\\nPhilipovna was very ill.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had found her in a condition approaching to absolute madness. She\\r\\nscreamed, and trembled, and cried out that Rogojin was hiding out there\\r\\nin the gardenâ\\x80\\x94that she had seen him herselfâ\\x80\\x94and that he would murder\\r\\nher in the nightâ\\x80\\x94that he would cut her throat. She was terribly\\r\\nagitated all day. But it so happened that the prince called at\\r\\nHippolyteâ\\x80\\x99s house later on, and heard from his mother that she had been\\r\\nin town all day, and had there received a visit from Rogojin, who had\\r\\nmade inquiries about Pavlofsk. On inquiry, it turned out that Rogojin\\r\\nvisited the old lady in town at almost the same moment when Nastasia\\r\\ndeclared that she had seen him in the garden; so that the whole thing\\r\\nturned out to be an illusion on her part. Nastasia immediately went\\r\\nacross to Hippolyteâ\\x80\\x99s to inquire more accurately, and returned\\r\\nimmensely relieved and comforted.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the day before the wedding, the prince left Nastasia in a state of\\r\\ngreat animation. Her wedding-dress and all sorts of finery had just\\r\\narrived from town. Muishkin had not imagined that she would be so\\r\\nexcited over it, but he praised everything, and his praise rendered her\\r\\ndoubly happy.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Nastasia could not hide the cause of her intense interest in her\\r\\nwedding splendour. She had heard of the indignation in the town, and\\r\\nknew that some of the populace was getting up a sort of charivari with\\r\\nmusic, that verses had been composed for the occasion, and that the\\r\\nrest of Pavlofsk society more or less encouraged these preparations.\\r\\nSo, since attempts were being made to humiliate her, she wanted to hold\\r\\nher head even higher than usual, and to overwhelm them all with the\\r\\nbeauty and taste of her toilette. â\\x80\\x9cLet them shout and whistle, if they\\r\\ndare!â\\x80\\x9d Her eyes flashed at the thought. But, underneath this, she had\\r\\nanother motive, of which she did not speak. She thought that possibly\\r\\nAglaya, or at any rate someone sent by her, would be present incognito\\r\\nat the ceremony, or in the crowd, and she wished to be prepared for\\r\\nthis eventuality.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince left her at eleven, full of these thoughts, and went home.\\r\\nBut it was not twelve oâ\\x80\\x99clock when a messenger came to say that\\r\\nNastasia was very bad, and he must come at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn hurrying back he found his bride locked up in her own room and could\\r\\nhear her hysterical cries and sobs. It was some time before she could\\r\\nbe made to hear that the prince had come, and then she opened the door\\r\\nonly just sufficiently to let him in, and immediately locked it behind\\r\\nhim. She then fell on her knees at his feet. (So at least Dana\\r\\nAlexeyevna reported.)\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat am I doing? What am I doing to you?â\\x80\\x9d she sobbed convulsively,\\r\\nembracing his knees.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince was a whole hour soothing and comforting her, and left her,\\r\\nat length, pacified and composed. He sent another messenger during the\\r\\nnight to inquire after her, and two more next morning. The last brought\\r\\nback a message that Nastasia was surrounded by a whole army of\\r\\ndressmakers and maids, and was as happy and as busy as such a beauty\\r\\nshould be on her wedding morning, and that there was not a vestige of\\r\\nyesterdayâ\\x80\\x99s agitation remaining. The message concluded with the news\\r\\nthat at the moment of the bearerâ\\x80\\x99s departure there was a great\\r\\nconfabulation in progress as to which diamonds were to be worn, and\\r\\nhow.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis message entirely calmed the princeâ\\x80\\x99s mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following report of the proceedings on the wedding day may be\\r\\ndepended upon, as coming from eye-witnesses.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wedding was fixed for eight oâ\\x80\\x99clock in the evening. Nastasia\\r\\nPhilipovna was ready at seven. From six oâ\\x80\\x99clock groups of people began\\r\\nto gather at Nastasiaâ\\x80\\x99s house, at the princeâ\\x80\\x99s, and at the church door,\\r\\nbut more especially at the former place. The church began to fill at\\r\\nseven.\\r\\n\\r\\nColia and Vera Lebedeff were very anxious on the princeâ\\x80\\x99s account, but\\r\\nthey were so busy over the arrangements for receiving the guests after\\r\\nthe wedding, that they had not much time for the indulgence of personal\\r\\nfeelings.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were to be very few guests besides the best men and so on; only\\r\\nDana Alexeyevna, the Ptitsins, Gania, and the doctor. When the prince\\r\\nasked Lebedeff why he had invited the doctor, who was almost a\\r\\nstranger, Lebedeff replied:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, he wears an â\\x80\\x98order,â\\x80\\x99 and it looks so well!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis idea amused the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nKeller and Burdovsky looked wonderfully correct in their dress-coats\\r\\nand white kid gloves, although Keller caused the bridegroom some alarm\\r\\nby his undisguisedly hostile glances at the gathering crowd of\\r\\nsight-seers outside.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt about half-past seven the prince started for the church in his\\r\\ncarriage.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may remark here that he seemed anxious not to omit a single one of\\r\\nthe recognized customs and traditions observed at weddings. He wished\\r\\nall to be done as openly as possible, and â\\x80\\x9cin due order.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nArrived at the church, Muishkin, under Kellerâ\\x80\\x99s guidance, passed\\r\\nthrough the crowd of spectators, amid continuous whispering and excited\\r\\nexclamations. The prince stayed near the altar, while Keller made off\\r\\nonce more to fetch the bride.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn reaching the gate of Daria Alexeyevnaâ\\x80\\x99s house, Keller found a far\\r\\ndenser crowd than he had encountered at the princeâ\\x80\\x99s. The remarks and\\r\\nexclamations of the spectators here were of so irritating a nature that\\r\\nKeller was very near making them a speech on the impropriety of their\\r\\nconduct, but was luckily caught by Burdovsky, in the act of turning to\\r\\naddress them, and hurried indoors.\\r\\n\\r\\nNastasia Philipovna was ready. She rose from her seat, looked into the\\r\\nglass and remarked, as Keller told the tale afterwards, that she was\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cas pale as a corpse.â\\x80\\x9d She then bent her head reverently, before the\\r\\nikon in the corner, and left the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nA torrent of voices greeted her appearance at the front door. The crowd\\r\\nwhistled, clapped its hands, and laughed and shouted; but in a moment\\r\\nor two isolated voices were distinguishable.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat a beauty!â\\x80\\x9d cried one.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, she isnâ\\x80\\x99t the first in the world, nor the last,â\\x80\\x9d said another.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMarriage covers everything,â\\x80\\x9d observed a third.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI defy you to find another beauty like that,â\\x80\\x9d said a fourth.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSheâ\\x80\\x99s a real princess! Iâ\\x80\\x99d sell my soul for such a princess as that!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNastasia came out of the house looking as white as any handkerchief;\\r\\nbut her large dark eyes shone upon the vulgar crowd like blazing coals.\\r\\nThe spectatorsâ\\x80\\x99 cries were redoubled, and became more exultant and\\r\\ntriumphant every moment. The door of the carriage was open, and Keller\\r\\nhad given his hand to the bride to help her in, when suddenly with a\\r\\nloud cry she rushed from him, straight into the surging crowd. Her\\r\\nfriends about her were stupefied with amazement; the crowd parted as\\r\\nshe rushed through it, and suddenly, at a distance of five or six yards\\r\\nfrom the carriage, appeared Rogojin. It was his look that had caught\\r\\nher eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nNastasia rushed to him like a madwoman, and seized both his hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSave me!â\\x80\\x9d she cried. â\\x80\\x9cTake me away, anywhere you like, quick!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRogojin seized her in his arms and almost carried her to the carriage.\\r\\nThen, in a flash, he tore a hundred-rouble note out of his pocket and\\r\\nheld it to the coachman.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTo the station, quick! If you catch the train you shall have another.\\r\\nQuick!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe leaped into the carriage after Nastasia and banged the door. The\\r\\ncoachman did not hesitate a moment; he whipped up the horses, and they\\r\\nwere off.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOne more second and I should have stopped him,â\\x80\\x9d said Keller,\\r\\nafterwards. In fact, he and Burdovsky jumped into another carriage and\\r\\nset off in pursuit; but it struck them as they drove along that it was\\r\\nnot much use trying to bring Nastasia back by force.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBesides,â\\x80\\x9d said Burdovsky, â\\x80\\x9cthe prince would not like it, would he?â\\x80\\x9d So\\r\\nthey gave up the pursuit.\\r\\n\\r\\nRogojin and Nastasia Philipovna reached the station just in time for\\r\\nthe train. As he jumped out of the carriage and was almost on the point\\r\\nof entering the train, Rogojin accosted a young girl standing on the\\r\\nplatform and wearing an old-fashioned, but respectable-looking, black\\r\\ncloak and a silk handkerchief over her head.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTake fifty roubles for your cloak?â\\x80\\x9d he shouted, holding the money out\\r\\nto the girl. Before the astonished young woman could collect her\\r\\nscattered senses, he pushed the money into her hand, seized the mantle,\\r\\nand threw it and the handkerchief over Nastasiaâ\\x80\\x99s head and shoulders.\\r\\nThe latterâ\\x80\\x99s wedding-array would have attracted too much attention, and\\r\\nit was not until some time later that the girl understood why her old\\r\\ncloak and kerchief had been bought at such a price.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe news of what had happened reached the church with extraordinary\\r\\nrapidity. When Keller arrived, a host of people whom he did not know\\r\\nthronged around to ask him questions. There was much excited talking,\\r\\nand shaking of heads, even some laughter; but no one left the church,\\r\\nall being anxious to observe how the now celebrated bridegroom would\\r\\ntake the news. He grew very pale upon hearing it, but took it quite\\r\\nquietly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was afraid,â\\x80\\x9d he muttered, scarcely audibly, â\\x80\\x9cbut I hardly thought it\\r\\nwould come to this.â\\x80\\x9d Then after a short silence, he added: â\\x80\\x9cHowever, in\\r\\nher state, it is quite consistent with the natural order of things.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEven Keller admitted afterwards that this was â\\x80\\x9cextraordinarily\\r\\nphilosophicalâ\\x80\\x9d on the princeâ\\x80\\x99s part. He left the church quite calm, to\\r\\nall appearances, as many witnesses were found to declare afterwards. He\\r\\nseemed anxious to reach home and be left alone as quickly as possible;\\r\\nbut this was not to be. He was accompanied by nearly all the invited\\r\\nguests, and besides this, the house was almost besieged by excited\\r\\nbands of people, who insisted upon being allowed to enter the verandah.\\r\\nThe prince heard Keller and Lebedeff remonstrating and quarrelling with\\r\\nthese unknown individuals, and soon went out himself. He approached the\\r\\ndisturbers of his peace, requested courteously to be told what was\\r\\ndesired; then politely putting Lebedeff and Keller aside, he addressed\\r\\nan old gentleman who was standing on the verandah steps at the head of\\r\\nthe band of would-be guests, and courteously requested him to honour\\r\\nhim with a visit. The old fellow was quite taken aback by this, but\\r\\nentered, followed by a few more, who tried to appear at their ease. The\\r\\nrest remained outside, and presently the whole crowd was censuring\\r\\nthose who had accepted the invitation. The prince offered seats to his\\r\\nstrange visitors, tea was served, and a general conversation sprang up.\\r\\nEverything was done most decorously, to the considerable surprise of\\r\\nthe intruders. A few tentative attempts were made to turn the\\r\\nconversation to the events of the day, and a few indiscreet questions\\r\\nwere asked; but Muishkin replied to everybody with such simplicity and\\r\\ngood-humour, and at the same time with so much dignity, and showed such\\r\\nconfidence in the good breeding of his guests, that the indiscreet\\r\\ntalkers were quickly silenced. By degrees the conversation became\\r\\nalmost serious. One gentleman suddenly exclaimed, with great vehemence:\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhatever happens, I shall not sell my property; I shall wait.\\r\\nEnterprise is better than money, and there, sir, you have my whole\\r\\nsystem of economy, if you wish!â\\x80\\x9d He addressed the prince, who warmly\\r\\ncommended his sentiments, though Lebedeff whispered in his ear that\\r\\nthis gentleman, who talked so much of his â\\x80\\x9cproperty,â\\x80\\x9d had never had\\r\\neither house or home.\\r\\n\\r\\nNearly an hour passed thus, and when tea was over the visitors seemed\\r\\nto think that it was time to go. As they went out, the doctor and the\\r\\nold gentleman bade Muishkin a warm farewell, and all the rest took\\r\\ntheir leave with hearty protestations of good-will, dropping remarks to\\r\\nthe effect that â\\x80\\x9cit was no use worrying,â\\x80\\x9d and that â\\x80\\x9cperhaps all would\\r\\nturn out for the best,â\\x80\\x9d and so on. Some of the younger intruders would\\r\\nhave asked for champagne, but they were checked by the older ones. When\\r\\nall had departed, Keller leaned over to Lebedeff, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWith you and me there would have been a scene. We should have shouted\\r\\nand fought, and called in the police. But he has simply made some new\\r\\nfriendsâ\\x80\\x94and such friends, too! I know them!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLebedeff, who was slightly intoxicated, answered with a sigh:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThings are hidden from the wise and prudent, and revealed unto babes.\\r\\nI have applied those words to him before, but now I add that God has\\r\\npreserved the babe himself from the abyss, He and all His saints.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, about half-past ten, the prince was left alone. His head\\r\\nached. Colia was the last to go, after having helped him to change his\\r\\nwedding clothes. They parted on affectionate terms, and, without\\r\\nspeaking of what had happened, Colia promised to come very early the\\r\\nnext day. He said later that the prince had given no hint of his\\r\\nintentions when they said good-bye, but had hidden them even from him.\\r\\nSoon there was hardly anyone left in the house. Burdovsky had gone to\\r\\nsee Hippolyte; Keller and Lebedeff had wandered off together somewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly Vera Lebedeff remained hurriedly rearranging the furniture in the\\r\\nrooms. As she left the verandah, she glanced at the prince. He was\\r\\nseated at the table, with both elbows upon it, and his head resting on\\r\\nhis hands. She approached him, and touched his shoulder gently. The\\r\\nprince started and looked at her in perplexity; he seemed to be\\r\\ncollecting his senses for a minute or so, before he could remember\\r\\nwhere he was. As recollection dawned upon him, he became violently\\r\\nagitated. All he did, however, was to ask Vera very earnestly to knock\\r\\nat his door and awake him in time for the first train to Petersburg\\r\\nnext morning. Vera promised, and the prince entreated her not to tell\\r\\nanyone of his intention. She promised this, too; and at last, when she\\r\\nhad half-closed the door, he called her back a third time, took her\\r\\nhands in his, kissed them, then kissed her forehead, and in a rather\\r\\npeculiar manner said to her, â\\x80\\x9cUntil tomorrow!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch was Veraâ\\x80\\x99s story afterwards.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe went away in great anxiety about him, but when she saw him in the\\r\\nmorning, he seemed to be quite himself again, greeted her with a smile,\\r\\nand told her that he would very likely be back by the evening. It\\r\\nappears that he did not consider it necessary to inform anyone\\r\\nexcepting Vera of his departure for town.\\r\\n\\r\\nXI.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn hour later he was in St. Petersburg, and by ten oâ\\x80\\x99clock he had rung\\r\\nthe bell at Rogojinâ\\x80\\x99s.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had gone to the front door, and was kept waiting a long while before\\r\\nanyone came. At last the door of old Mrs. Rogojinâ\\x80\\x99s flat was opened,\\r\\nand an aged servant appeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cParfen Semionovitch is not at home,â\\x80\\x9d she announced from the doorway.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhom do you want?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cParfen Semionovitch.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe is not in.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old woman examined the prince from head to foot with great\\r\\ncuriosity.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAt all events tell me whether he slept at home last night, and whether\\r\\nhe came alone?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old woman continued to stare at him, but said nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWas not Nastasia Philipovna here with him, yesterday evening?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd, pray, who are you yourself?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPrince Lef Nicolaievitch Muishkin; he knows me well.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe is not at home.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman lowered her eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd Nastasia Philipovna?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know nothing about it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cStop a minute! When will he come back?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know that either.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe door was shut with these words, and the old woman disappeared. The\\r\\nprince decided to come back within an hour. Passing out of the house,\\r\\nhe met the porter.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs Parfen Semionovitch at home?â\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy did they tell me he was not at home, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhere did they tell you so,â\\x80\\x94at his door?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, at his motherâ\\x80\\x99s flat; I rang at Parfen Semionovitchâ\\x80\\x99s door and\\r\\nnobody came.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, he may have gone out. I canâ\\x80\\x99t tell. Sometimes he takes the keys\\r\\nwith him, and leaves the rooms empty for two or three days.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you know for certain that he was at home last night?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, he was.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWas Nastasia Philipovna with him?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know; she doesnâ\\x80\\x99t come often. I think I should have known if\\r\\nshe had come.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince went out deep in thought, and walked up and down the\\r\\npavement for some time. The windows of all the rooms occupied by\\r\\nRogojin were closed, those of his motherâ\\x80\\x99s apartments were open. It was\\r\\na hot, bright day. The prince crossed the road in order to have a good\\r\\nlook at the windows again; not only were Rogojinâ\\x80\\x99s closed, but the\\r\\nwhite blinds were all down as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stood there for a minute and then, suddenly and strangely enough, it\\r\\nseemed to him that a little corner of one of the blinds was lifted, and\\r\\nRogojinâ\\x80\\x99s face appeared for an instant and then vanished. He waited\\r\\nanother minute, and decided to go and ring the bell once more; however,\\r\\nhe thought better of it again and put it off for an hour.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chief object in his mind at this moment was to get as quickly as he\\r\\ncould to Nastasia Philipovnaâ\\x80\\x99s lodging. He remembered that, not long\\r\\nsince, when she had left Pavlofsk at his request, he had begged her to\\r\\nput up in town at the house of a respectable widow, who had\\r\\nwell-furnished rooms to let, near the Ismailofsky barracks. Probably\\r\\nNastasia had kept the rooms when she came down to Pavlofsk this last\\r\\ntime; and most likely she would have spent the night in them, Rogojin\\r\\nhaving taken her straight there from the station.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince took a droshky. It struck him as he drove on that he ought\\r\\nto have begun by coming here, since it was most improbable that Rogojin\\r\\nshould have taken Nastasia to his own house last night. He remembered\\r\\nthat the porter said she very rarely came at all, so that it was still\\r\\nless likely that she would have gone there so late at night.\\r\\n\\r\\nVainly trying to comfort himself with these reflections, the prince\\r\\nreached the Ismailofsky barracks more dead than alive.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo his consternation the good people at the lodgings had not only heard\\r\\nnothing of Nastasia, but all came out to look at him as if he were a\\r\\nmarvel of some sort. The whole family, of all ages, surrounded him, and\\r\\nhe was begged to enter. He guessed at once that they knew perfectly\\r\\nwell who he was, and that yesterday ought to have been his wedding-day;\\r\\nand further that they were dying to ask about the wedding, and\\r\\nespecially about why he should be here now, inquiring for the woman who\\r\\nin all reasonable human probability might have been expected to be with\\r\\nhim in Pavlofsk.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe satisfied their curiosity, in as few words as possible, with regard\\r\\nto the wedding, but their exclamations and sighs were so numerous and\\r\\nsincere that he was obliged to tell the whole storyâ\\x80\\x94in a short form, of\\r\\ncourse. The advice of all these agitated ladies was that the prince\\r\\nshould go at once and knock at Rogojinâ\\x80\\x99s until he was let in: and when\\r\\nlet in insist upon a substantial explanation of everything. If Rogojin\\r\\nwas really not at home, the prince was advised to go to a certain\\r\\nhouse, the address of which was given, where lived a German lady, a\\r\\nfriend of Nastasia Philipovnaâ\\x80\\x99s. It was possible that she might have\\r\\nspent the night there in her anxiety to conceal herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince rose from his seat in a condition of mental collapse. The\\r\\ngood ladies reported afterwards that â\\x80\\x9chis pallor was terrible to see,\\r\\nand his legs seemed to give way underneath him.â\\x80\\x9d With difficulty he was\\r\\nmade to understand that his new friends would be glad of his address,\\r\\nin order to act with him if possible. After a momentâ\\x80\\x99s thought he gave\\r\\nthe address of the small hotel, on the stairs of which he had had a fit\\r\\nsome five weeks since. He then set off once more for Rogojinâ\\x80\\x99s.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis time they neither opened the door at Rogojinâ\\x80\\x99s flat nor at the one\\r\\nopposite. The prince found the porter with difficulty, but when found,\\r\\nthe man would hardly look at him or answer his questions, pretending to\\r\\nbe busy. Eventually, however, he was persuaded to reply so far as to\\r\\nstate that Rogojin had left the house early in the morning and gone to\\r\\nPavlofsk, and that he would not return today at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI shall wait; he may come back this evening.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe may not be home for a week.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen, at all events, he _did_ sleep here, did he?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWellâ\\x80\\x94he did sleep here, yes.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this was suspicious and unsatisfactory. Very likely the porter had\\r\\nreceived new instructions during the interval of the princeâ\\x80\\x99s absence;\\r\\nhis manner was so different now. He had been obligingâ\\x80\\x94now he was as\\r\\nobstinate and silent as a mule. However, the prince decided to call\\r\\nagain in a couple of hours, and after that to watch the house, in case\\r\\nof need. His hope was that he might yet find Nastasia at the address\\r\\nwhich he had just received. To that address he now set off at full\\r\\nspeed.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut alas! at the German ladyâ\\x80\\x99s house they did not even appear to\\r\\nunderstand what he wanted. After a while, by means of certain hints, he\\r\\nwas able to gather that Nastasia must have had a quarrel with her\\r\\nfriend two or three weeks ago, since which date the latter had neither\\r\\nheard nor seen anything of her. He was given to understand that the\\r\\nsubject of Nastasiaâ\\x80\\x99s present whereabouts was not of the slightest\\r\\ninterest to her; and that Nastasia might marry all the princes in the\\r\\nworld for all she cared! So Muishkin took his leave hurriedly. It\\r\\nstruck him now that she might have gone away to Moscow just as she had\\r\\ndone the last time, and that Rogojin had perhaps gone after her, or\\r\\neven _with_ her. If only he could find some trace!\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, he must take his room at the hotel; and he started off in that\\r\\ndirection. Having engaged his room, he was asked by the waiter whether\\r\\nhe would take dinner; replying mechanically in the affirmative, he sat\\r\\ndown and waited; but it was not long before it struck him that dining\\r\\nwould delay him. Enraged at this idea, he started up, crossed the dark\\r\\npassage (which filled him with horrible impressions and gloomy\\r\\nforebodings), and set out once more for Rogojinâ\\x80\\x99s. Rogojin had not\\r\\nreturned, and no one came to the door. He rang at the old ladyâ\\x80\\x99s door\\r\\nopposite, and was informed that Parfen Semionovitch would not return\\r\\nfor three days. The curiosity with which the old servant stared at him\\r\\nagain impressed the prince disagreeably. He could not find the porter\\r\\nthis time at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs before, he crossed the street and watched the windows from the other\\r\\nside, walking up and down in anguish of soul for half an hour or so in\\r\\nthe stifling heat. Nothing stirred; the blinds were motionless; indeed,\\r\\nthe prince began to think that the apparition of Rogojinâ\\x80\\x99s face could\\r\\nhave been nothing but fancy. Soothed by this thought, he drove off once\\r\\nmore to his friends at the Ismailofsky barracks. He was expected there.\\r\\nThe mother had already been to three or four places to look for\\r\\nNastasia, but had not found a trace of any kind.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince said nothing, but entered the room, sat down silently, and\\r\\nstared at them, one after the other, with the air of a man who cannot\\r\\nunderstand what is being said to him. It was strangeâ\\x80\\x94one moment he\\r\\nseemed to be so observant, the next so absent; his behaviour struck all\\r\\nthe family as most remarkable. At length he rose from his seat, and\\r\\nbegged to be shown Nastasiaâ\\x80\\x99s rooms. The ladies reported afterwards how\\r\\nhe had examined everything in the apartments. He observed an open book\\r\\non the table, Madam Bovary, and requested the leave of the lady of the\\r\\nhouse to take it with him. He had turned down the leaf at the open\\r\\npage, and pocketed it before they could explain that it was a library\\r\\nbook. He had then seated himself by the open window, and seeing a\\r\\ncard-table, he asked who played cards.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was informed that Nastasia used to play with Rogojin every evening,\\r\\neither at â\\x80\\x9cpreferenceâ\\x80\\x9d or â\\x80\\x9clittle fool,â\\x80\\x9d or â\\x80\\x9cwhistâ\\x80\\x9d; that this had been\\r\\ntheir practice since her last return from Pavlofsk; that she had taken\\r\\nto this amusement because she did not like to see Rogojin sitting\\r\\nsilent and dull for whole evenings at a time; that the day after\\r\\nNastasia had made a remark to this effect, Rogojin had whipped a pack\\r\\nof cards out of his pocket. Nastasia had laughed, but soon they began\\r\\nplaying. The prince asked where were the cards, but was told that\\r\\nRogojin used to bring a new pack every day, and always carried it away\\r\\nin his pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe good ladies recommended the prince to try knocking at Rogojinâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nonce moreâ\\x80\\x94not at once, but in the evening. Meanwhile, the mother would\\r\\ngo to Pavlofsk to inquire at Dana Alexeyevnaâ\\x80\\x99s whether anything had\\r\\nbeen heard of Nastasia there. The prince was to come back at ten\\r\\noâ\\x80\\x99clock and meet her, to hear her news and arrange plans for the\\r\\nmorrow.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of the kindly-meant consolations of his new friends, the\\r\\nprince walked to his hotel in inexpressible anguish of spirit, through\\r\\nthe hot, dusty streets, aimlessly staring at the faces of those who\\r\\npassed him. Arrived at his destination, he determined to rest awhile in\\r\\nhis room before he started for Rogojinâ\\x80\\x99s once more. He sat down, rested\\r\\nhis elbows on the table and his head on his hands, and fell to\\r\\nthinking.\\r\\n\\r\\nHeaven knows how long and upon what subjects he thought. He thought of\\r\\nmany thingsâ\\x80\\x94of Vera Lebedeff, and of her father; of Hippolyte; of\\r\\nRogojin himself, first at the funeral, then as he had met him in the\\r\\npark, then, suddenly, as they had met in this very passage, outside,\\r\\nwhen Rogojin had watched in the darkness and awaited him with uplifted\\r\\nknife. The prince remembered his enemyâ\\x80\\x99s eyes as they had glared at him\\r\\nin the darkness. He shuddered, as a sudden idea struck him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis idea was, that if Rogojin were in Petersburg, though he might hide\\r\\nfor a time, yet he was quite sure to come to himâ\\x80\\x94the princeâ\\x80\\x94before\\r\\nlong, with either good or evil intentions, but probably with the same\\r\\nintention as on that other occasion. At all events, if Rogojin were to\\r\\ncome at all he would be sure to seek the prince hereâ\\x80\\x94he had no other\\r\\ntown addressâ\\x80\\x94perhaps in this same corridor; he might well seek him here\\r\\nif he needed him. And perhaps he did need him. This idea seemed quite\\r\\nnatural to the prince, though he could not have explained why he should\\r\\nso suddenly have become necessary to Rogojin. Rogojin would not come if\\r\\nall were well with him, that was part of the thought; he would come if\\r\\nall were not well; and certainly, undoubtedly, all would not be well\\r\\nwith him. The prince could not bear this new idea; he took his hat and\\r\\nrushed out towards the street. It was almost dark in the passage.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat if he were to come out of that corner as I go by andâ\\x80\\x94and stop\\r\\nme?â\\x80\\x9d thought the prince, as he approached the familiar spot. But no one\\r\\ncame out.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe passed under the gateway and into the street. The crowds of people\\r\\nwalking aboutâ\\x80\\x94as is always the case at sunset in Petersburg, during the\\r\\nsummerâ\\x80\\x94surprised him, but he walked on in the direction of Rogojinâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nhouse.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout fifty yards from the hotel, at the first cross-road, as he passed\\r\\nthrough the crowd of foot-passengers sauntering along, someone touched\\r\\nhis shoulder, and said in a whisper into his ear:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLef Nicolaievitch, my friend, come along with me.â\\x80\\x9d It was Rogojin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince immediately began to tell him, eagerly and joyfully, how he\\r\\nhad but the moment before expected to see him in the dark passage of\\r\\nthe hotel.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was there,â\\x80\\x9d said Rogojin, unexpectedly. â\\x80\\x9cCome along.â\\x80\\x9d The prince was\\r\\nsurprised at this answer; but his astonishment increased a couple of\\r\\nminutes afterwards, when he began to consider it. Having thought it\\r\\nover, he glanced at Rogojin in alarm. The latter was striding along a\\r\\nyard or so ahead, looking straight in front of him, and mechanically\\r\\nmaking way for anyone he met.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy did you not ask for me at my room if you were in the hotel?â\\x80\\x9d asked\\r\\nthe prince, suddenly.\\r\\n\\r\\nRogojin stopped and looked at him; then reflected, and replied as\\r\\nthough he had not heard the question:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLook here, Lef Nicolaievitch, you go straight on to the house; I shall\\r\\nwalk on the other side. See that we keep together.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo saying, Rogojin crossed the road.\\r\\n\\r\\nArrived on the opposite pavement, he looked back to see whether the\\r\\nprince were moving, waved his hand in the direction of the Gorohovaya,\\r\\nand strode on, looking across every moment to see whether Muishkin\\r\\nunderstood his instructions. The prince supposed that Rogojin desired\\r\\nto look out for someone whom he was afraid to miss; but if so, why had\\r\\nhe not told _him_ whom to look out for? So the two proceeded for half a\\r\\nmile or so. Suddenly the prince began to tremble from some unknown\\r\\ncause. He could not bear it, and signalled to Rogojin across the road.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe latter came at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs Nastasia Philipovna at your house?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd was it you looked out of the window under the blind this morning?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen why didâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the prince could not finish his question; he did not know what to\\r\\nsay. Besides this, his heart was beating so that he found it difficult\\r\\nto speak at all. Rogojin was silent also and looked at him as before,\\r\\nwith an expression of deep thoughtfulness.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, Iâ\\x80\\x99m going,â\\x80\\x9d he said, at last, preparing to recross the road.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou go along here as before; we will keep to different sides of the\\r\\nroad; itâ\\x80\\x99s better so, youâ\\x80\\x99ll see.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they reached the Gorohovaya, and came near the house, the princeâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nlegs were trembling so that he could hardly walk. It was about ten\\r\\noâ\\x80\\x99clock. The old ladyâ\\x80\\x99s windows were open, as before; Rogojinâ\\x80\\x99s were\\r\\nall shut, and in the darkness the white blinds showed whiter than ever.\\r\\nRogojin and the prince each approached the house on his respective side\\r\\nof the road; Rogojin, who was on the near side, beckoned the prince\\r\\nacross. He went over to the doorway.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEven the porter does not know that I have come home now. I told him,\\r\\nand told them at my motherâ\\x80\\x99s too, that I was off to Pavlofsk,â\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nRogojin, with a cunning and almost satisfied smile. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99ll go in\\r\\nquietly and nobody will hear us.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had the key in his hand. Mounting the staircase he turned and\\r\\nsignalled to the prince to go more softly; he opened the door very\\r\\nquietly, let the prince in, followed him, locked the door behind him,\\r\\nand put the key in his pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome along,â\\x80\\x9d he whispered.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had spoken in a whisper all the way. In spite of his apparent\\r\\noutward composure, he was evidently in a state of great mental\\r\\nagitation. Arrived in a large salon, next to the study, he went to the\\r\\nwindow and cautiously beckoned the prince up to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen you rang the bell this morning I thought it must be you. I went\\r\\nto the door on tip-toe and heard you talking to the servant opposite. I\\r\\nhad told her before that if anyone came and rangâ\\x80\\x94especially you, and I\\r\\ngave her your nameâ\\x80\\x94she was not to tell about me. Then I thought, what\\r\\nif he goes and stands opposite and looks up, or waits about to watch\\r\\nthe house? So I came to this very window, looked out, and there you\\r\\nwere staring straight at me. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s how it came about.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhere is Nastasia Philipovna?â\\x80\\x9d asked the prince, breathlessly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSheâ\\x80\\x99s here,â\\x80\\x9d replied Rogojin, slowly, after a slight pause.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhere?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRogojin raised his eyes and gazed intently at the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome,â\\x80\\x9d he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe continued to speak in a whisper, very deliberately as before, and\\r\\nlooked strangely thoughtful and dreamy. Even while he told the story of\\r\\nhow he had peeped through the blind, he gave the impression of wishing\\r\\nto say something else. They entered the study. In this room some\\r\\nchanges had taken place since the prince last saw it. It was now\\r\\ndivided into two equal parts by a heavy green silk curtain stretched\\r\\nacross it, separating the alcove beyond, where stood Rogojinâ\\x80\\x99s bed,\\r\\nfrom the rest of the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe heavy curtain was drawn now, and it was very dark. The bright\\r\\nPetersburg summer nights were already beginning to close in, and but\\r\\nfor the full moon, it would have been difficult to distinguish anything\\r\\nin Rogojinâ\\x80\\x99s dismal room, with the drawn blinds. They could just see\\r\\none anothers faces, however, though not in detail. Rogojinâ\\x80\\x99s face was\\r\\nwhite, as usual. His glittering eyes watched the prince with an intent\\r\\nstare.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHad you not better light a candle?â\\x80\\x9d said Muishkin.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I neednâ\\x80\\x99t,â\\x80\\x9d replied Rogojin, and taking the other by the hand he\\r\\ndrew him down to a chair. He himself took a chair opposite and drew it\\r\\nup so close that he almost pressed against the princeâ\\x80\\x99s knees. At their\\r\\nside was a little round table.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSit down,â\\x80\\x9d said Rogojin; â\\x80\\x9cletâ\\x80\\x99s rest a bit.â\\x80\\x9d There was silence for a\\r\\nmoment.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI knew you would be at that hotel,â\\x80\\x9d he continued, just as men\\r\\nsometimes commence a serious conversation by discussing any outside\\r\\nsubject before leading up to the main point. â\\x80\\x9cAs I entered the passage\\r\\nit struck me that perhaps you were sitting and waiting for me, just as\\r\\nI was waiting for you. Have you been to the old lady at Ismailofsky\\r\\nbarracks?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, squeezing the word out with difficulty owing to\\r\\nthe dreadful beating of his heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI thought you would. â\\x80\\x98Theyâ\\x80\\x99ll talk about it,â\\x80\\x99 I thought; so I\\r\\ndetermined to go and fetch you to spend the night hereâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98We will be\\r\\ntogether,â\\x80\\x99 I thought, â\\x80\\x98for this one nightâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cRogojin, _where_ is Nastasia Philipovna?â\\x80\\x9d said the prince, suddenly\\r\\nrising from his seat. He was quaking in all his limbs, and his words\\r\\ncame in a scarcely audible whisper. Rogojin rose also.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere,â\\x80\\x9d he whispered, nodding his head towards the curtain.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAsleep?â\\x80\\x9d whispered the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nRogojin looked intently at him again, as before.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLetâ\\x80\\x99s go inâ\\x80\\x94but you mustnâ\\x80\\x99tâ\\x80\\x94wellâ\\x80\\x94letâ\\x80\\x99s go in.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe lifted the curtain, pausedâ\\x80\\x94and turned to the prince. â\\x80\\x9cGo in,â\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nsaid, motioning him to pass behind the curtain. Muishkin went in.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s so dark,â\\x80\\x9d he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou can see quite enough,â\\x80\\x9d muttered Rogojin.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI can just see thereâ\\x80\\x99s a bedâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGo nearer,â\\x80\\x9d suggested Rogojin, softly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince took a step forwardâ\\x80\\x94then anotherâ\\x80\\x94and paused. He stood and\\r\\nstared for a minute or two.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeither of the men spoke a word while at the bedside. The princeâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nheart beat so loud that its knocking seemed to be distinctly audible in\\r\\nthe deathly silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut now his eyes had become so far accustomed to the darkness that he\\r\\ncould distinguish the whole of the bed. Someone was asleep upon itâ\\x80\\x94in\\r\\nan absolutely motionless sleep. Not the slightest movement was\\r\\nperceptible, not the faintest breathing could be heard. The sleeper was\\r\\ncovered with a white sheet; the outline of the limbs was hardly\\r\\ndistinguishable. He could only just make out that a human being lay\\r\\noutstretched there.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll around, on the bed, on a chair beside it, on the floor, were\\r\\nscattered the different portions of a magnificent white silk dress,\\r\\nbits of lace, ribbons and flowers. On a small table at the bedside\\r\\nglittered a mass of diamonds, torn off and thrown down anyhow. From\\r\\nunder a heap of lace at the end of the bed peeped a small white foot,\\r\\nwhich looked as though it had been chiselled out of marble; it was\\r\\nterribly still.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince gazed and gazed, and felt that the more he gazed the more\\r\\ndeath-like became the silence. Suddenly a fly awoke somewhere, buzzed\\r\\nacross the room, and settled on the pillow. The prince shuddered.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLetâ\\x80\\x99s go,â\\x80\\x9d said Rogojin, touching his shoulder. They left the alcove\\r\\nand sat down in the two chairs they had occupied before, opposite to\\r\\none another. The prince trembled more and more violently, and never\\r\\ntook his questioning eyes off Rogojinâ\\x80\\x99s face.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI see you are shuddering, Lef Nicolaievitch,â\\x80\\x9d said the latter, at\\r\\nlength, â\\x80\\x9calmost as you did once in Moscow, before your fit; donâ\\x80\\x99t you\\r\\nremember? I donâ\\x80\\x99t know what I shall do with youâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince bent forward to listen, putting all the strain he could\\r\\nmuster upon his understanding in order to take in what Rogojin said,\\r\\nand continuing to gaze at the latterâ\\x80\\x99s face.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWas it you?â\\x80\\x9d he muttered, at last, motioning with his head towards the\\r\\ncurtain.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, it was I,â\\x80\\x9d whispered Rogojin, looking down.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeither spoke for five minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBecause, you know,â\\x80\\x9d Rogojin recommenced, as though continuing a former\\r\\nsentence, â\\x80\\x9cif you were ill now, or had a fit, or screamed, or anything,\\r\\nthey might hear it in the yard, or even in the street, and guess that\\r\\nsomeone was passing the night in the house. They would all come and\\r\\nknock and want to come in, because they know I am not at home. I didnâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nlight a candle for the same reason. When I am not hereâ\\x80\\x94for two or three\\r\\ndays at a time, now and thenâ\\x80\\x94no one comes in to tidy the house or\\r\\nanything; those are my orders. So that I want them to not know we are\\r\\nspending the night hereâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWait,â\\x80\\x9d interrupted the prince. â\\x80\\x9cI asked both the porter and the woman\\r\\nwhether Nastasia Philipovna had spent last night in the house; so they\\r\\nknewâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know you asked. I told them that she had called in for ten minutes,\\r\\nand then gone straight back to Pavlofsk. No one knows she slept here.\\r\\nLast night we came in just as carefully as you and I did today. I\\r\\nthought as I came along with her that she would not like to creep in so\\r\\nsecretly, but I was quite wrong. She whispered, and walked on tip-toe;\\r\\nshe carried her skirt over her arm, so that it shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t rustle, and\\r\\nshe held up her finger at me on the stairs, so that I shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t make a\\r\\nnoiseâ\\x80\\x94it was you she was afraid of. She was mad with terror in the\\r\\ntrain, and she begged me to bring her to this house. I thought of\\r\\ntaking her to her rooms at the Ismailofsky barracks first; but she\\r\\nwouldnâ\\x80\\x99t hear of it. She said, â\\x80\\x98Noâ\\x80\\x94not there; heâ\\x80\\x99ll find me out at once\\r\\nthere. Take me to your own house, where you can hide me, and tomorrow\\r\\nweâ\\x80\\x99ll set off for Moscow.â\\x80\\x99 Thence she would go to Orel, she said. When\\r\\nshe went to bed, she was still talking about going to Orel.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWait! What do you intend to do now, Parfen?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, Iâ\\x80\\x99m afraid of you. You shudder and tremble so. Weâ\\x80\\x99ll pass the\\r\\nnight here together. There are no other beds besides that one; but Iâ\\x80\\x99ve\\r\\nthought how weâ\\x80\\x99ll manage. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll take the cushions off all the sofas, and\\r\\nlay them down on the floor, up against the curtain hereâ\\x80\\x94for you and\\r\\nmeâ\\x80\\x94so that we shall be together. For if they come in and look about\\r\\nnow, you know, theyâ\\x80\\x99ll find her, and carry her away, and theyâ\\x80\\x99ll be\\r\\nasking me questions, and I shall say I did it, and then theyâ\\x80\\x99ll take me\\r\\naway, too, donâ\\x80\\x99t you see? So let her lie close to usâ\\x80\\x94close to you and\\r\\nme.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, yes,â\\x80\\x9d agreed the prince, warmly.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo we will not say anything about it, or let them take her away?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot for anything!â\\x80\\x9d cried the other; â\\x80\\x9cno, no, no!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo I had decided, my friend; not to give her up to anyone,â\\x80\\x9d continued\\r\\nRogojin. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99ll be very quiet. I have only been out of the house one\\r\\nhour all day, all the rest of the time I have been with her. I dare say\\r\\nthe air is very bad here. It is so hot. Do you find it bad?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t knowâ\\x80\\x94perhapsâ\\x80\\x94by morning it will be.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve covered her with oilclothâ\\x80\\x94best American oilcloth, and put the\\r\\nsheet over that, and four jars of disinfectant, on account of the\\r\\nsmellâ\\x80\\x94as they did at Moscowâ\\x80\\x94you remember? And sheâ\\x80\\x99s lying so still; you\\r\\nshall see, in the morning, when itâ\\x80\\x99s light. What! canâ\\x80\\x99t you get up?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nasked Rogojin, seeing the other was trembling so that he could not rise\\r\\nfrom his seat.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy legs wonâ\\x80\\x99t move,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince; â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s fear, I know. When my fear\\r\\nis over, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll get upâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWait a bitâ\\x80\\x94Iâ\\x80\\x99ll make the bed, and you can lie down. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll lie down,\\r\\ntoo, and weâ\\x80\\x99ll listen and watch, for I donâ\\x80\\x99t know yet what I shall\\r\\ndo... I tell you beforehand, so that you may be ready in case Iâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMuttering these disconnected words, Rogojin began to make up the beds.\\r\\nIt was clear that he had devised these beds long before; last night he\\r\\nslept on the sofa. But there was no room for two on the sofa, and he\\r\\nseemed anxious that he and the prince should be close to one another;\\r\\ntherefore, he now dragged cushions of all sizes and shapes from the\\r\\nsofas, and made a sort of bed of them close by the curtain. He then\\r\\napproached the prince, and gently helped him to rise, and led him\\r\\ntowards the bed. But the prince could now walk by himself, so that his\\r\\nfear must have passed; for all that, however, he continued to shudder.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s hot weather, you see,â\\x80\\x9d continued Rogojin, as he lay down on the\\r\\ncushions beside Muishkin, â\\x80\\x9cand, naturally, there will be a smell. I\\r\\ndarenâ\\x80\\x99t open the window. My mother has some beautiful flowers in pots;\\r\\nthey have a delicious scent; I thought of fetching them in, but that\\r\\nold servant will find out, sheâ\\x80\\x99s very inquisitive.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, she is inquisitive,â\\x80\\x9d assented the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI thought of buying flowers, and putting them all round her; but I was\\r\\nafraid it would make us sad to see her with flowers round her.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLook here,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince; he was bewildered, and his brain\\r\\nwandered. He seemed to be continually groping for the questions he\\r\\nwished to ask, and then losing them. â\\x80\\x9cListenâ\\x80\\x94tell meâ\\x80\\x94how did youâ\\x80\\x94with a\\r\\nknife?â\\x80\\x94That same one?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, that same one.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWait a minute, I want to ask you something else, Parfen; all sorts of\\r\\nthings; but tell me first, did you intend to kill her before my\\r\\nwedding, at the church door, with your knife?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know whether I did or not,â\\x80\\x9d said Rogojin, drily, seeming to be\\r\\na little astonished at the question, and not quite taking it in.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDid you never take your knife to Pavlofsk with you?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo. As to the knife,â\\x80\\x9d he added, â\\x80\\x9cthis is all I can tell you about it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nHe was silent for a moment, and then said, â\\x80\\x9cI took it out of the locked\\r\\ndrawer this morning about three, for it was in the early morning all\\r\\nthisâ\\x80\\x94happened. It has been inside the book ever sinceâ\\x80\\x94andâ\\x80\\x94andâ\\x80\\x94this is\\r\\nwhat is such a marvel to me, the knife only went in a couple of inches\\r\\nat most, just under her left breast, and there wasnâ\\x80\\x99t more than half a\\r\\ntablespoonful of blood altogether, not more.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYesâ\\x80\\x94yesâ\\x80\\x94yesâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d The prince jumped up in extraordinary agitation. â\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nknow, I know, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve read of that sort of thingâ\\x80\\x94itâ\\x80\\x99s internal\\r\\nhaemorrhage, you know. Sometimes there isnâ\\x80\\x99t a dropâ\\x80\\x94if the blow goes\\r\\nstraight to the heartâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWaitâ\\x80\\x94listen!â\\x80\\x9d cried Rogojin, suddenly, starting up. â\\x80\\x9cSomebodyâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nwalking about, do you hear? In the hall.â\\x80\\x9d Both sat up to listen.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI hear,â\\x80\\x9d said the prince in a whisper, his eyes fixed on Rogojin.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFootsteps?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShall we shut the door, and lock it, or not?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, lock it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey locked the door, and both lay down again. There was a long\\r\\nsilence.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, by-the-by,â\\x80\\x9d whispered the prince, hurriedly and excitedly as\\r\\nbefore, as though he had just seized hold of an idea and was afraid of\\r\\nlosing it again. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x94I wanted those cards! They say you played cards\\r\\nwith her?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I played with her,â\\x80\\x9d said Rogojin, after a short silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhere are the cards?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHere they are,â\\x80\\x9d said Rogojin, after a still longer pause.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe pulled out a pack of cards, wrapped in a bit of paper, from his\\r\\npocket, and handed them to the prince. The latter took them, with a\\r\\nsort of perplexity. A new, sad, helpless feeling weighed on his heart;\\r\\nhe had suddenly realized that not only at this moment, but for a long\\r\\nwhile, he had not been saying what he wanted to say, had not been\\r\\nacting as he wanted to act; and that these cards which he held in his\\r\\nhand, and which he had been so delighted to have at first, were now of\\r\\nno useâ\\x80\\x94no use... He rose, and wrung his hands. Rogojin lay motionless,\\r\\nand seemed neither to hear nor see his movements; but his eyes blazed\\r\\nin the darkness, and were fixed in a wild stare.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince sat down on a chair, and watched him in alarm. Half an hour\\r\\nwent by.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly Rogojin burst into a loud abrupt laugh, as though he had quite\\r\\nforgotten that they must speak in whispers.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat officer, eh!â\\x80\\x94that young officerâ\\x80\\x94donâ\\x80\\x99t you remember that fellow at\\r\\nthe band? Eh? Ha, ha, ha! Didnâ\\x80\\x99t she whip him smartly, eh?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince jumped up from his seat in renewed terror. When Rogojin\\r\\nquieted down (which he did at once) the prince bent over him, sat down\\r\\nbeside him, and with painfully beating heart and still more painful\\r\\nbreath, watched his face intently. Rogojin never turned his head, and\\r\\nseemed to have forgotten all about him. The prince watched and waited.\\r\\nTime went onâ\\x80\\x94it began to grow light.\\r\\n\\r\\nRogojin began to wanderâ\\x80\\x94muttering disconnectedly; then he took to\\r\\nshouting and laughing. The prince stretched out a trembling hand and\\r\\ngently stroked his hair and his cheeksâ\\x80\\x94he could do nothing more. His\\r\\nlegs trembled again and he seemed to have lost the use of them. A new\\r\\nsensation came over him, filling his heart and soul with infinite\\r\\nanguish.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile the daylight grew full and strong; and at last the prince lay\\r\\ndown, as though overcome by despair, and laid his face against the\\r\\nwhite, motionless face of Rogojin. His tears flowed on to Rogojinâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ncheek, though he was perhaps not aware of them himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt all events when, after many hours, the door was opened and people\\r\\nthronged in, they found the murderer unconscious and in a raging fever.\\r\\nThe prince was sitting by him, motionless, and each time that the sick\\r\\nman gave a laugh, or a shout, he hastened to pass his own trembling\\r\\nhand over his companionâ\\x80\\x99s hair and cheeks, as though trying to soothe\\r\\nand quiet him. But alas! he understood nothing of what was said to him,\\r\\nand recognized none of those who surrounded him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Schneider himself had arrived then and seen his former pupil and\\r\\npatient, remembering the princeâ\\x80\\x99s condition during the first year in\\r\\nSwitzerland, he would have flung up his hands, despairingly, and cried,\\r\\nas he did then:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAn idiot!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nXII.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the widow hurried away to Pavlofsk, she went straight to Daria\\r\\nAlexeyevnaâ\\x80\\x99s house, and telling all she knew, threw her into a state of\\r\\ngreat alarm. Both ladies decided to communicate at once with Lebedeff,\\r\\nwho, as the friend and landlord of the prince, was also much agitated.\\r\\nVera Lebedeff told all she knew, and by Lebedeffâ\\x80\\x99s advice it was\\r\\ndecided that all three should go to Petersburg as quickly as possible,\\r\\nin order to avert â\\x80\\x9cwhat might so easily happen.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is how it came about that at eleven oâ\\x80\\x99clock next morning Rogojinâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nflat was opened by the police in the presence of Lebedeff, the two\\r\\nladies, and Rogojinâ\\x80\\x99s own brother, who lived in the wing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evidence of the porter went further than anything else towards the\\r\\nsuccess of Lebedeff in gaining the assistance of the police. He\\r\\ndeclared that he had seen Rogojin return to the house last night,\\r\\naccompanied by a friend, and that both had gone upstairs very secretly\\r\\nand cautiously. After this there was no hesitation about breaking open\\r\\nthe door, since it could not be got open in any other way.\\r\\n\\r\\nRogojin suffered from brain fever for two months. When he recovered\\r\\nfrom the attack he was at once brought up on trial for murder.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe gave full, satisfactory, and direct evidence on every point; and the\\r\\nprinceâ\\x80\\x99s name was, thanks to this, not brought into the proceedings.\\r\\nRogojin was very quiet during the progress of the trial. He did not\\r\\ncontradict his clever and eloquent counsel, who argued that the brain\\r\\nfever, or inflammation of the brain, was the cause of the crime;\\r\\nclearly proving that this malady had existed long before the murder was\\r\\nperpetrated, and had been brought on by the sufferings of the accused.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Rogojin added no words of his own in confirmation of this view, and\\r\\nas before, he recounted with marvellous exactness the details of his\\r\\ncrime. He was convicted, but with extenuating circumstances, and\\r\\ncondemned to hard labour in Siberia for fifteen years. He heard his\\r\\nsentence grimly, silently, and thoughtfully. His colossal fortune, with\\r\\nthe exception of the comparatively small portion wasted in the first\\r\\nwanton period of his inheritance, went to his brother, to the great\\r\\nsatisfaction of the latter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old lady, Rogojinâ\\x80\\x99s mother, is still alive, and remembers her\\r\\nfavourite son Parfen sometimes, but not clearly. God spared her the\\r\\nknowledge of this dreadful calamity which had overtaken her house.\\r\\n\\r\\nLebedeff, Keller, Gania, Ptitsin, and many other friends of ours\\r\\ncontinue to live as before. There is scarcely any change in them, so\\r\\nthat there is no need to tell of their subsequent doings.\\r\\n\\r\\nHippolyte died in great agitation, and rather sooner than he expected,\\r\\nabout a fortnight after Nastasia Philipovnaâ\\x80\\x99s death. Colia was much\\r\\naffected by these events, and drew nearer to his mother in heart and\\r\\nsympathy. Nina Alexandrovna is anxious, because he is â\\x80\\x9cthoughtful\\r\\nbeyond his years,â\\x80\\x9d but he will, we think, make a useful and active man.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe princeâ\\x80\\x99s further fate was more or less decided by Colia, who\\r\\nselected, out of all the persons he had met during the last six or\\r\\nseven months, Evgenie Pavlovitch, as friend and confidant. To him he\\r\\nmade over all that he knew as to the events above recorded, and as to\\r\\nthe present condition of the prince. He was not far wrong in his\\r\\nchoice. Evgenie Pavlovitch took the deepest interest in the fate of the\\r\\nunfortunate â\\x80\\x9cidiot,â\\x80\\x9d and, thanks to his influence, the prince found\\r\\nhimself once more with Dr. Schneider, in Switzerland.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvgenie Pavlovitch, who went abroad at this time, intending to live a\\r\\nlong while on the continent, being, as he often said, quite superfluous\\r\\nin Russia, visits his sick friend at Schneiderâ\\x80\\x99s every few months.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Dr. Schneider frowns ever more and more and shakes his head; he\\r\\nhints that the brain is fatally injured; he does not as yet declare\\r\\nthat his patient is incurable, but he allows himself to express the\\r\\ngravest fears.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvgenie takes this much to heart, and he has a heart, as is proved by\\r\\nthe fact that he receives and even answers letters from Colia. But\\r\\nbesides this, another trait in his character has become apparent, and\\r\\nas it is a good trait we will make haste to reveal it. After each visit\\r\\nto Schneiderâ\\x80\\x99s establishment, Evgenie Pavlovitch writes another letter,\\r\\nbesides that to Colia, giving the most minute particulars concerning\\r\\nthe invalidâ\\x80\\x99s condition. In these letters is to be detected, and in\\r\\neach one more than the last, a growing feeling of friendship and\\r\\nsympathy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe individual who corresponds thus with Evgenie Pavlovitch, and who\\r\\nengages so much of his attention and respect, is Vera Lebedeff. We have\\r\\nnever been able to discover clearly how such relations sprang up. Of\\r\\ncourse the root of them was in the events which we have already\\r\\nrecorded, and which so filled Vera with grief on the princeâ\\x80\\x99s account\\r\\nthat she fell seriously ill. But exactly how the acquaintance and\\r\\nfriendship came about, we cannot say.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have spoken of these letters chiefly because in them is often to be\\r\\nfound some news of the Epanchin family, and of Aglaya in particular.\\r\\nEvgenie Pavlovitch wrote of her from Paris, that after a short and\\r\\nsudden attachment to a certain Polish count, an exile, she had suddenly\\r\\nmarried him, quite against the wishes of her parents, though they had\\r\\neventually given their consent through fear of a terrible scandal.\\r\\nThen, after a six monthsâ\\x80\\x99 silence, Evgenie Pavlovitch informed his\\r\\ncorrespondent, in a long letter, full of detail, that while paying his\\r\\nlast visit to Dr. Schneiderâ\\x80\\x99s establishment, he had there come across\\r\\nthe whole Epanchin family (excepting the general, who had remained in\\r\\nSt. Petersburg) and Prince S. The meeting was a strange one. They all\\r\\nreceived Evgenie Pavlovitch with effusive delight; Adelaida and\\r\\nAlexandra were deeply grateful to him for his â\\x80\\x9cangelic kindness to the\\r\\nunhappy prince.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLizabetha Prokofievna, when she saw poor Muishkin, in his enfeebled and\\r\\nhumiliated condition, had wept bitterly. Apparently all was forgiven\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrince S. had made a few just and sensible remarks. It seemed to\\r\\nEvgenie Pavlovitch that there was not yet perfect harmony between\\r\\nAdelaida and her fiance, but he thought that in time the impulsive\\r\\nyoung girl would let herself be guided by his reason and experience.\\r\\nBesides, the recent events that had befallen her family had given\\r\\nAdelaida much to think about, especially the sad experiences of her\\r\\nyounger sister. Within six months, everything that the family had\\r\\ndreaded from the marriage with the Polish count had come to pass. He\\r\\nturned out to be neither count nor exileâ\\x80\\x94at least, in the political\\r\\nsense of the wordâ\\x80\\x94but had had to leave his native land owing to some\\r\\nrather dubious affair of the past. It was his noble patriotism, of\\r\\nwhich he made a great display, that had rendered him so interesting in\\r\\nAglayaâ\\x80\\x99s eyes. She was so fascinated that, even before marrying him,\\r\\nshe joined a committee that had been organized abroad to work for the\\r\\nrestoration of Poland; and further, she visited the confessional of a\\r\\ncelebrated Jesuit priest, who made an absolute fanatic of her. The\\r\\nsupposed fortune of the count had dwindled to a mere nothing, although\\r\\nhe had given almost irrefutable evidence of its existence to Lizabetha\\r\\nProkofievna and Prince S.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides this, before they had been married half a year, the count and\\r\\nhis friend the priest managed to bring about a quarrel between Aglaya\\r\\nand her family, so that it was now several months since they had seen\\r\\nher. In a word, there was a great deal to say; but Mrs. Epanchin, and\\r\\nher daughters, and even Prince S., were still so much distressed by\\r\\nAglayaâ\\x80\\x99s latest infatuations and adventures, that they did not care to\\r\\ntalk of them, though they must have known that Evgenie knew much of the\\r\\nstory already.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor Lizabetha Prokofievna was most anxious to get home, and, according\\r\\nto Evgenieâ\\x80\\x99s account, she criticized everything foreign with much\\r\\nhostility.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey canâ\\x80\\x99t bake bread anywhere, decently; and they all freeze in their\\r\\nhouses, during winter, like a lot of mice in a cellar. At all events,\\r\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ve had a good Russian cry over this poor fellow,â\\x80\\x9d she added, pointing\\r\\nto the prince, who had not recognized her in the slightest degree. â\\x80\\x9cSo\\r\\nenough of this nonsense; itâ\\x80\\x99s time we faced the truth. All this\\r\\ncontinental life, all this Europe of yours, and all the trash about\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98going abroadâ\\x80\\x99 is simply foolery, and it is mere foolery on our part to\\r\\ncome. Remember what I say, my friend; youâ\\x80\\x99ll live to agree with me\\r\\nyourself.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo spoke the good lady, almost angrily, as she took leave of Evgenie\\r\\nPavlovitch.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE IDIOT ***\\r\\n\\r\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\\r\\nbe renamed.\\r\\n\\r\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\r\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\r\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\\r\\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\\r\\nroyalties.

INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the\\r\\ntrademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone\\r\\nproviding copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in\\r\\naccordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the\\r\\nproduction, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\nelectronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,\\r\\nincluding legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of\\r\\nthe following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this\\r\\nor any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or\\r\\nadditions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any\\r\\nDefect you cause.\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\\r\\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\\r\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\r\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\\r\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\r\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\\r\\nwww.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\\r\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\r\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\r\\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\r\\nU.S. federal laws and your state\\'s laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation\\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\\r\\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\\r\\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\\'s website\\r\\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\\r\\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\r\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\\r\\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\r\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\r\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\r\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\\r\\nvolunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\r\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\r\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\r\\nedition.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\r\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n'"
